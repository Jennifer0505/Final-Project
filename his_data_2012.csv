"2",2,"btw, Mcveigh used 4800 lbs of fertilizer containing ammonia nitrate. They have tried to regulate the sale of this fertilzer for reasons such as this but of course the right wing won't let it happened because regulation is apart of the evil big government.....smh  

"
"3",3,"Huckabee made it seem so easy that if the shooter didn't have a gun, he would have used a bomb. What? Guns were easily accessable to this guy!"
"4",4,"Saying that this is because god isn't in schools is a fucking insult to the families, and a fucking insult to me, as I knew Noah Pozner's family, and used to babysit him for the family. I hope huckabee one day feels the same way I feel, so he knows that politicians and the Media only use stuff like this as a means to make money and spread their message. it's fucking disgusting. You want to respect the dead? Make memorials, don't focus on the shooter.
"
"5",5,"Timothy McVeigh didn't need a firearm to to 168 people, the largest homeland terrorist attack second to 9/11. He used racing fuel and a moving truck. Those are way easier to get than a firearm."
"6",6,"And yes, there is another difference ...

Drumroll ....

* (S)SRI's *  -- not all these other countries are hoped up on brain candy"
"7",7,"That's right @colt ... Because they are all slaves to their systems, and have no means of defense even if they did have Any sort of problem and needed a resort.  Good observation 

What good is a cop - if he's 10 min out ... And I'm bleeding from the chest, because my resort was to die. ... Screw you colt"
"8",8,"You're a fucking idiot, get a clue and see that Huckabee is trying to profit politically in this."
"9",9,"People like Huckabee make me thank god I'm an atheist!"
"10",10,"they could not pay a security guard enough to get shot at could you? why not just post soldiers .....not that they get paid any better but they are at least trained to do the job."
"11",11,"god is in churches. that doesn't stop bad things from happening there. why would a school be any different with him ""there""?
"
"12",12,"What a moron. There are about 20 comparable countries to the USA in terms of economic development, democratic principles, level of educational attainment. America is the one where they make a national pastime of mass shootings. God is not the difference, the number of guns is!"
"13",13,"Mike Huckabee needs 2keep his f*cking trap shut. Those poor parents don't need 2hear it was THEIR fault their kids died, cuz they put them in a wicked public school where they don't bow down 2Jesus every day. Disgusting!"
"14",14,"It's funny that republicans would want people to require their photo ID to vote but refuse to have a background check for people who trying to purchase a gun.My Huckabee has insulted the families of these victims with everything he has said in this video and that is Sad."
"15",15,"Mike is an asshole.
"
"16",16,"I believe that God has nothing to do with what happened.  
"
"17",17,"We found the new world in America. We went there. we destroyed the indiginous population.Then we settled it with the rejects of Europe.Then we destroyed the beautiful land with our stupidity."
"18",18,"This guy at the beginning said "" sensible proposals out of the senate "" lol... Oh man my side is hurting from laughing. "
"19",19,"Before bashing conservative personalities you how about you INTERVIEW them first to see where they are coming from you fucking douche bag "
"20",20,"Except Hitler was elected democratically and enjoyed widespread support amongst the German population fucktard! And lets see what good your semi-auto AR's do you when the government starts nuking rebel strongholds! So then do you suggest that we make nuclear warheads legal so that militias can challenge the power of the government? Seriously little boy are you fu/cking retarded?"
"21",21,"Hilarious how these cons live behind their 'constitutional Republic'.  They hold dear their 2nd amendment but cancel out it was written, the right to bear arms against a standing army.  They don't like that bit.  And the 1st amendment? Ah, hell no- separation of church and state.  Goofball idiots and their knee jerk ideology.  They're useless."
"22",22,"How stupid is this fundamentalist idiots"
"23",23,"They ask: Why you don't believe in God?

I say: I do.  Just not the one you do.

My God created the universe a few billion years ago for the main intent of entertainment."
"24",24,"Which god should be put back in school? The god of christians (which subcategory?), the god of muslims? etc...? Our schools are now a true melting pot where you have all religions, all faiths, all races, etc..."
"25",25,"Actually, I would have like to have seen god prevalent in that school when the shooting happened, ""Don't worry children, god will protect you from the bullets"" "
"26",26,"god is the ultimate absent father, you don't get more absent than non existence.

Obama: ""God has called them all home""
I think the parents would rather have their children with them."
"27",27,"If god was going to stop the shooting then why didn't he stop the Spanish Inquisition, or the Crusades?"
"28",28,"Dude u don't know what your taking about!!! But u can see that!!!"
"29",29,"okay this is far fetched but his point of ""people will find a way to do harm is correct"".  and to be honest I would like for god to be put back in school... 
"
"30",30,"mike huckabee and his god are fucking monsters"
"31",31,"So your a Nazi pig, I knew it!  We all knew you're a Nazi and want to see more holocausts at the hands of the Government.... OH WAIT, they can't do that here because we have guns and we would fight back!  Wow did Susan just learn what the second amendment is for.... prob not she is too stupid.  You should take your picture off your not good looking at all and I wouldn't let your husband near a gun since I'm sure he'd rather do himself than do you."
"32",32,"This kind of talk would not even make news here in Germany. These people would be considered too crazy to allow on tv.  I love my country (USA) but if I had to choose between the 2 countries, I would choose Germany.   America is so frightening.  I will pray for you all."
"33",33,"I don't talk about god, eternity, religion at the gym either, but does that make it deserve to be a ""place of carnage""? Huckabee is an imbecile."
"34",34,"You are totally right SamSeder"
"35",35,"He is correct,when we turn our backs to God,things like this happens and thats when people come together and go to churches.But do we really need for these things to happen to turn to God?"
"36",36,"...And if Darth Vader was there, he could've choked the shooter from across the galaxy."
"37",37,"God's all up in the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts--but that didn't stop the child molesters."
"38",38,"Huckabee also believes it is possible to pray the gay away and that the earth is only 6000 years old. What a fool...."
"39",39,"When you have a nation that's armed to the teeth,  and in a perpetual state of war... anybody that finds themselves surprised by this lunacy is a fucking moron.  America:  your chickens are coming home to roost."
"40",40,"That's the fallacy of perfection. To take no action, no decision unless the action is perfect. The fact is a solution can improve a situation without necessarily fixing it."
"41",41,"This is not a heart issue huckabee.  Sociopaths have a neurological disorder. There is no amount of god that is going to increase electrical flow to the orbital cortex, and prevent a sociopath from being a sociopath.  These comments are what you can expect from people who waive the use of their critical thinking faculties and view the world through the lens of literal scripture. "
"42",42,"A perfect example of how the logic of religion fails miserably. "
"43",43,"Fact Your comment is a lie. The decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to remove school prayer happened in 1962. Prior to 1962, there had been over 60 school shootings and other form of murder.
Here's another fact for you: Huckabee says that shootings happened because of ""less God in schools"" but USA is the MOST christian nation of the western industrialized world and 15 of the 25 most deadly mass shootings happened in it. 
Fact: Huckabee and you have used no facts."
"44",44,"Holmes had homemade bombs and he didn't use any. The Columbine killers had homemade bombs and they didn't work. I'm far less worried of homemade bombs than I am manufactured guns easily attainable in this society. "
"45",45,"I just have to say, this God is really weak.  He doesn't seem to be able to prevent anything from happening.  

He can't even stop murders from taking place in his own houses of worship."
"46",46,"You can pray any God Damned time you want.  Nobody is stopping anyone in school from praying.  

Kids can pray on their own.  Teachers can pray on their own.  Principals can pray on their own.  Nobody from the school can lead prayer.

They don't have to conceal anything.  

Now, here is what you must be concerned about.  Given that we value religious freedom, and that you want to increase prayer in school, will you arrange the school day so that Muslims can pray at noon and in the afternoon?  

"
"47",47,"wait a minute..u cant be serious? you are LITTERALLY saying that your God is so vengeful that he let these CHILDREN be MURDERED out of SPITE? you are freakin serious? u think god let these things happen out of SPITE? You and people LIKE you is the reason religion is becoming so unpalatable to the average American. Your MENTALITY is the reason athiesm is on the rise.......u think God let this happen out of spite? that is filthy. and which God should we be praying to in schools? Your god?"
"48",48,"""Fact: When we were allowed to practice our 1st amendment rights to freedom of religion by reciting the Lords prayer & the Pledge of Allegiance we DID NOT have school shootings""

Anyone is still allowed to recite any prayer they want, and most schools still recite the pledge of allegiance (with ""under god"") daily.

Your premise is baseless."
"49",49,"'You can take every gun away in America and somebody'll use a bomb.'
Then why do you ban bombs? If it's a case of the bad guys having bombs and you not having any, shouldn't you own a bomb, Mike? Shouldn't you be given your own Patriot missile, just in case? What a fucking moron."
"50",50,"I think if God were a type of interventionist that Huckabee thinks he is, he might have stopped his son from being tortured and nailed to a cross to die. "
"51",51,"Fact: When we were allowed to practice our 1st amendment rights to freedom of religion by reciting the Lords prayer & the Pledge of Allegiance we DID NOT have school shootings. Huckabee's theory is based on fact. Yours is based on dumbass emotion."
"52",52,"4:15
95% of the time, when someone says some variation of the phrase ""it's interesting that"", they will make a statement that's not interesting at all."
"53",53,"So what are Jewish people supposed to do in public schools if Christianity was in those schools?"
"54",54,"What an impotent god. Btw, that's how most preachers treat their flock- like a bunch of 4 yr olds."
"55",55,"What a piece of shit!!! I used to respect you Hakabee"
"56",56,"By the way. In 200 years we've had ONE shooting spree. No more, one since 1814. It was last year or something, a mental pasient made a bomb and went on a shooting spree on innocent kids. He was christian and a fan of USA, he ordered ammo and stuff from the US, built an ANFO-bomb and killed 70 kids. NOw he's in a psych-ward deep inside a prison and will never be released, so I think that will remain the only ""spree"" ever:)"
"57",57,"And wiki Norway if you think I'm bullshitting, hehe!: )"
"58",58,"THe 98% percent are invested abroad to secure coming generations' futures too. We invest broadly, but one example is that we now own 2% of all ownable stocks. Tiny NOrway owns shitloads and invest shitloads of money every year. Our petroleum will last at least 70-80yrs more, by the way. When everybody's comfortable, when every country you visit have 5-10 times lower prices and many times lower wages, you feel lucky and pleased to be a citizen of Norway, and why would you rob or kill? Cheers! : )"
"59",59,"I'm tired, so I forgot some ortography here and misspelled words. POint is we're the world's 5th largest oil exporter, 3rd largest on gas, and only 2% of the profits are used to run the country best in the world according to the UN. We're most developed, most democratic, have the highest wages(and prices,though), and wiki says we'll remain richest for all foreseeable future. (Per capita, just in this decade we've entered, a 100 new, big oil-fields will get hundreds and hundreds new rigs)Cool,no?"
"60",60,"No, they never carry guns. In the extremely rare occasions armed crimes take place, the of course have access at policestation and in their cars, but carrying guns in a country where no armed crimes happen, nobody carry guns, nobody's poor or live in ghettos or are crackheads. Norway is the richest country in the world per capita(98 000GDP per capita, USA has 47 000..)And everybody has money to live decent lives,there is no""1%""here who grabs 80% of the money.We're 5mn people, 5th largest on oil."
"61",61,"We're mostly atheists here in Sweden. We have no God in our schools. I guess we have a LOT of school shootings I don't know about. They had one in Finland a couple of years ago, with guns bought from the US."
"62",62,"Hitchens was an active opponent of torture. Watch his interviews about waterboarding and Guantanamo Bay. He didn't support Bush, he supported the military intervention in Iraq for Left-Wing idealistic purposes (rather then oil interest and the like). He was very critical of Bush, the closest thing to kind he ever said regarding him was that if Bush wished to be an ally in the struggle to save the Kurdish people then so be it. "
"63",63,"In Sweden we don't have the same issues when it comes to guns and owning guns. I can't remember ever even seeing a gun in the hands of a civilian. And guess what: we VERY rarely have things like this happening over here. The strange part is, we're also one of the countries with the highest number of atheists in the population. Our prime minister is openly an atheist, and no one has a problem with it! Would someone PLEASE buy Huckabee a ticket to fly over here and see all this for himself?"
"64",64,"These people aren't going to go through learning how to put a bomb together and then plant it. Guns are easier.. Laws DO change these things. Again that's why the rig lost. They are clueless and logic plays no part in their thought process. Are they going to put guns in schools? They Fidel hatred.. Against different groups. Is god in the movie theatre? He claims that's why it happened in schools. Come on"
"65",65,"We need better gnu control. Have you noticed those that don't want that every time something like this happens they scream NO MORE GUN CONTROL instead of how bad it was. Guns kill people.. People use guns to kill people. Mak it harder to get guns!. His claims that they would use a bomb.. Please. Gns are easier to use that's why it happens. Come on. That's why the right lost and will continue to. They are clueless"
"66",66,"""Thou shalt not kill"", ""Honor they neighbor""

...hate to admit it but Huck makes a good point."
"67",67,"Your pathetic god does little for molestation victims. "
"68",68,"The ant-gun control people are retarded. What makes them retarded? When they say retarded shit like ""Oh if we make guns illegal they will find a different way?"" So even if thats true, we should make it easier for them to commit the crime? And someone i went to school with who im friends with on FB said ""If the teachers had guns they could have fought the guy!"" Because having people who's job is to be around kids at all times should have fire arms within arm's reach is suuuuuch a good idea"
"69",69,"That guy needs to take his god and shove it up his ass. Hes simply trying to distract us from the real issue. The fucking gun."
"70",70,"This is the moment when disturbed socially unadapted, twisted minded christians come out of the closet and show that the Right Wing = Westboro Baptist Church or even worst sht"
"71",71,"This moron wanted to be president  this is worst than ""god intended rape to happen"" or ""women can shut the whole thing down"".   "
"72",72,"Apparently Huckabee's god is rather sensitive. If you don't mention him and praise him in public schools on a daily basis, he'll get into a bad mood and won't stop bullets from hitting children. "
"73",73,"kids getting guns is not a gun issue its a parent issue.  This is a rough take if you ban one gun they will use a differnt one.  The god issue is still a parent issue, Religion should be taught at home, that is if religion is the problem."
"74",74,"Another religious douchebag."
"75",75,"Not all children in our schools believe in the same god huckashit believes in, how myopic are people like huckashit. This happened because god was taken out of school? Bullshit"
"76",76,"He'll be there in the aftermath, thanks huckabee's god. "
"77",77,"Mike Huckabee will be indicted for murder should he ever set foot in the state of Washington. Maurice Clemons sent the Gov. a letter with a few Christian dog-whistles and Huckabee paroled him. Clemons later, of course, shot down four Lakewood police officers in cold blood. And Huckabee's response? 'I had no choice, the parole board said ""yes""'. Please Governor, PLEASE, come to Washington and tell us that!!! "
"78",78,"If God were into punishing people, he would have taken out Westboro Baptist, Fred Phelps and jerks like Huckabee a long time ago.  Children died and the Bible thumpers are out using it as an opportunity to push their sick barbaric superstitions.  People like this love to use tragedy as a way to browbeat others into submitting before their bronze age idols--until it's realized we humans survive and triumph not through blind faith but careful reason...We must rethink our gun laws."
"79",79,"Right. There you are. Hitchens can commit every other sin and (certain) leftists will forgive him everything as long as he says there is no God. Selah."
"80",80,"Some one's putting money in Huckabee's pocket.  What a sell-out and charlatan."
"81",81,"What is the difference between a god who does nothing, and the god who does not exist?"
"82",82,"1. Adam Lanza was home schooled.
 "
"83",83,"I had no idea God was so petty..."
"84",84,"Prayer was in school when the schools were legally segregated by race."
"85",85,"Fox News asks, why did god let this happen? FOX, I have news for you, THERE IS NO GOD!"
"86",86,"Cash 4 clunkers. Do it."
"87",87,"I watch a lot of crime documentaries. Lot's of them include brutal and sadistic sexual torture of their victims (on a side note it's nuts that a powerful god watches with indifference). You become desensitized after a while.

In some countries, guns are banned, and it works, but these are countries with good education, excellent healthcare for the mentally ill, good work programs, low poverty, etc. In the U.S., people are batshit crazy and you should carry a gun."
"88",88,"Well, I think hatred, anger and resentment poisons everything; and Hitchens awful cheerleading for Bush's wars and torture is quite a testament to that. Can people on the left stop worshipping that fat, misogynist, arrogant bully?"
"89",89,"If God is all -- powerful and all -- knowing, why the hell does he need the constraints of a state mandate to show up he wants to? It is silly to believe that somehow this tragedy was a result of government not forcing Evangelical Christian prayer (sorry, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, agnostics, etc) on America's schoolchildren. What kind of God does Rev. Gov. Huckabee believe in? "
"90",90,"Dude, the people believe the Earth was created in 7 days, Burning Bushes, World Wide Floods, and that every sngle animal on Earth can fit on a Boat...AND YOU WONDER IF THEY HAVE A CHILD'S MENTALITY...anyone who believes in nonsense in the Bible is actual fact thinks on a Child's mental ability..."
"91",91,"I'd forgotten I really hate jesus freaks.  I wanna thank Mike Huckabee for reminding me."
"92",92,"Bill Hicks had a better quote against those pro-gun religious nutjobs, it went something like this ""Cuz I know if Jesus was around today, he'd be carrying a f*cking UZI on him."" "
"93",93,"Norway police don't carry guns ? 
"
"94",94,"And the entire world doesn't want to be like America and its gun lunacy. "
"95",95,"Is he really saying he would kill people if god didn't forbid it?"
"96",96,"i dont wanna be like china...."
"97",97,"Ban all Religion."
"98",98,"I live in the 4th least religious country in the world, no gods in our schools, and we've never had ONE school shooting. In fact, Norway has only had ONE shooting spree ever in 200 years. ONE, that psycho who shot kids. He was a fan of America and guns and even a christian, by the way. Now he's in the looney house for life, so it'll probably only ever be that ONE shooting spree here. No crime here, no violence, no poverty, so the police don't even carry guns. Never have, never will.: )"
"99",99,"How can Santa Claus let this happen?!?"
"100",100,"The fact that otherwise normal people DO listen to shits like Huckabee is a direct function of religiosity's influence on society. The religious fascists in America are no different from their Mid-Eastern counterparts: they value their dogma and religion-dominionist agendas more than they do human life, even when it is that of children.

""Religion poisons everything.""

"101",101,"Only the Republican party would even consider such an ignorant blowhard as Mike Huckabee as a presidential candidate."
"102",102,"Play it again Sam!"
"103",103,"God is the source of morality.  If you do not bow down and worship god he will throw a fit and kill children.  Yep - sounds like an excellent source of morality to me! "
"104",104,"I Hate Huckabee"
"105",105,"Timothy Mcveigh the Oklahoma City Bomber didn't use a gun. He killed 168 innocent people including 19 children under the age of 6. He injured over 680 people all with a homemade bomb made out of items that you can still buy openly. Huckabee is right, if someone whats to kill people then they will find ways to do it if they can't do it with a firearm. Now I don't think to well of Huckabee, as a matter of fact I think the guy is slime. But when someone is right there right."

"122",122,"RIP to the staff and children that were in this accident <3 so sad how some partents told their kid(s) that they will see them after school and turns out that some of those parents will not be bringing their baby home, and those Christmas presents arnt being opened this Christmas </3 some kids are with their family but probably still changed because they saw their best friend or teacher get killed or the kids who were there to hear the gun shots </3 I hope the families will get better"

"135",135,"Honduras is considered to be a developing nation, not yet a full democracy in any sense of the word.  You cannot compare countries that are not yet democratic, and in this case one of the poorest countries in the world, to the US. It makes the comparison invalid - a research term. The comparison holds validity only when you compare countries of similar context, in this case those of the western 'civilized' world.  "

"137",137,"The tool used to kill is completely immaterial to WHY. Even if you could keep a gun from being available, they will just use something else. And yes there are things far more dangerous than bullets. This country needs to get over it's gun paranoia. That is not a solution."

-Their website, linked to from Wiki. Read it yourself. 
Honduras gun ownership: 6 guns per 100 people. Dwarfed by the US 88.82 per 100 in your own numbers. Gun proliferation, nor availability creates homicide or any other crime. Simple fact. Deal with PEOPLE not their tools. "

"142",142,"Omg it's not gun control we need it's health care and common sense for the mentally challenged. It's idiots who blame the innocent instead of shedding the light on Obama which now a days for a mental child to get the care they need must do a certain crime to get attention"

"145",145,"So according to the comments I been reading this list is just distasteful and will only promote more mass shootings. So what about Watchmojo Top 10 list of US Serial Killers? Look this video was not made to condone nor glorify the actions committed by these men or to even rank them by which was the bloodiest or had the most casualties.

Also, this tourism was before the Connecticut shooting  - I am taking your word on numbers so let's see what happens next year.  I don't live in fear as Canada doesn't have the second highest murder rate in the western world - you do."
"149",149,"I keep hearing this story, but then why aren't other western countries like Canada, the UK and Australia afraid of their governments?  They all have strict gun laws. Is the US not becoming a bit paranoid since you are a democracy along with these other countries?"

There are many factors that go into the murder rate...The US has more GDP then all those countries combined...that does not mean money causes murders either "

"162",162,"OK, I will go on point.  We Canadians do NOT feel safer knowing how lax gun laws are in the states.  Many people are becoming afraid to travel there as a result of the significant number of shootings that take place. The data shows that your gun culture is not a safe one, and it doesn't take much thought to see this.  I am not against a free society, and I am not saying that the constitution should be scrapped.  You exaggerate the issue when it is just one thing - too many guns easily available."

"325",325,"No, it wouldn't, guns count as 40% of deaths"
"326",326,"no killings would go up. using a gun is traceable without a gun people will just use switchblades and stab you in the street in public and pull it back unto his sleeve and he would get away with it"
"327",327,"most of the shooters were addicts to legal drugs "
"328",328,"Number 9 is my hometown :("
"329",329,"""isnt really infamous""?
do you know what infamous mean "
"330",330,"Of course such incidents should be remembered. But don't you think that it is at least in some way wrong to present mass murders as a top 10? Though it might not be intended that way here, a top 10 implicitely renders every placing successively superior to its antecedent in some way, as they are in a transitive relation. That of course contradicts the purpose of commemoration, as it can be taken as glorification of the macabre."
"331",331,"It is hard to kill with out gun."
"332",332,"I thought the Unabomber would be included"
"333",333,"These shootings were a huge part of our history, and like any piece of history we should learn from it. Why not educate people about these so they can be prevented, rather than just pretending like they never happened? MAJOR props to you watchmojo, for doing this. I honestly am glad they did, and do not find it offensive. History is history, weather good history or not. And we need to learn from it. "
"334",334,"Must are from bein bullied or just had enough"
"335",335,"my favoire it the colombine high shooting,that is my top number 1mass shooting"
"336",336,"compare gun crime in the UK with the USA (scale it down to account for the population difference). Your welcome."
"337",337,"Number 9 isn't really infamous, the news even got to the netherlands. And normally we don't get much news from the USA."
"338",338,"Damn, the last couple of Watchmojo videos have all had something to do with death
"
"339",339,"i love how most ppl that are anti gun  are also pro abortion . . . . .."
"340",340,"just saying, i guessed number 1. These events are so sad"
"341",341,"i was glad to see that final part with manson because he gets a bad wrap from people. he is actually a very intellengent person and i think he would make a wonderful teacher or principle because he would find out the root of childrens the problems and FIX THEM."
"342",342,"where's the Hollywood shoot out at? That one became the reason why cops started to carry semi automatic rifles instead of shotguns."
"343",343,"Here in Finland we have stricter gun laws, but we've had our school massacres too sadly. Banning guns isn't the solution, they who want guns will get them anyway. Like Dave Chapelle said, let's make bullets cost like 10 000 dollars each."
"344",344,"I see all these comments talking about ""Banning Guns"", criminals will still get them. How much stuff is illegal that criminals get? Cocaine, Heroin, Etc...If we ban guns, lets ban knives, vehicles, prescription drugs since all those tend to kill people. The silliness of a country that would rather blame an inamiate object other than insane piece of garbage is quite odd."
"345",345,"It would make it HARDER for them to get access to a gun AND ammo"
"346",346,"@amapoorguy * Guns don't kill people"
"347",347,"With guns..."
"348",348,"America and Guns :("
"349",349,"If we ban guns, then criminals would get them the usual way they do things... ILLEGALLY!"
"350",350,"Damn i hate when people blame violent games or movies as the reason people do these kind of things, what about the millions of people who also play and watch those movies and dont go around killing people, its not rap, movies, games not even broken homes i come from a broken home and i haven't killed anyone in about 22 years but hey maybe im doing something wrong. Some people are just fucked in the head from the day they are born."
"351",351,"But you can't argue with the fact that guns make killing people a lot easier, especially on a large scale. Guns made these mass killings possible, no other available weapon would have achieved the same effect."
"352",352,"Yea but u can't easily massacre people with a knife or even a one shot hunting rifle can u idiot"
"353",353,"Trenchcoatmafia ftw!"
"354",354,"I fully agree, and I LOVE my second amendment, but murder rates would go down if there were no guns."
"355",355,"Yes it may be. I don't think one should be ranking tragedies."
"356",356,"Fuck james holmes "
"357",357,"... Rachels challenge, that goes to different schools and urges kids to take a stand. When I was in 7th grade the Rachel's challenge came and the whole school went to the presentation, it was so moving that some people were either in or near tears including myself. I have never heard a story so tradgec in my life, and that goes with all of the incedents mentioned in the vid. It's so sad that these things have happend... Anyway that's just an example and i'm sorry i had to use two comment boxes."
"358",358,"I'm sorry to kinda inturupt but this goes in a similar context for what you guys are saying. Sometimes in the end good things come out to help prevent these same massacres from happening again. For example the infamus Columbine shooting. The first person to die that day was Rachel, she was just sitting outside, eating junch when the shooting started. Yeas before this she drew a outline of her hand making a pledge to stop bullying and things of that nature. The effects of her story sparked..."

"365",365,">Implying support of the NRA is ""brainless"""
"366",366,"Where do they get ammo?"
"367",367,"well you know criminals will defiantly fallow the law, and totally not gun smuggle guns and won't leave law abiding citizens defenseless... use your head dumbass "
"368",368,"why make a top 10 of this
"
"369",369,"That would stop people from buying guns from gun shops, we do need them for the economy... If we stop selling ammo too"
"370",370,"Blame the NRA stupid gun laws intended to shield criminals and idiots from punishment. More Gun deaths, more public fear, more gun sales. If you still support the NRA policy of selling guns to idiots with no limits on numbers, types, magazine size, the gun show loophole and all that... I have a new name for what you are: âGUNCUNTâ.If you donât like that, well too bad! I donât like what has happened to America thanks to your brainless support of the NRA. So damn the NRA, damn guns, damn guncunts."

"372",372,"I don't understand can someone please explain how someone can have 6 life sentences ?"
"373",373,"Thats deep man..."
"374",374,"Yeah, because criminals obey the law."
"375",375,"Our videos look back at anniversaries, birthdays, deaths etc., and tomorrow Dec 6th marks the anniversary of the 1989 massacre at L'Ãcole Polytechnique in Montreal.  Of all the videos we could have produced, this seemed like a good way to educate and inform audiences on the history of massacres.  Is it better to outright ignore the anniversary?"

God it pisses me off when people say ugly people like me should not reproduce no its stupid morons like that lady that should not reproduce. "
"397",397,"Really?! Blaming a chicken MCnugget for your husbands"
"398",398,"No, believe me you don't. I live in a country where gun laws are insanely strict and trust me, the possibility of having a firearm in your self-defense gives you a great advantage over an assailant. Guns kill people everywhere even though they are illegal, look at Brazil for example."

"406",406,"Regardless of the gun control argument, I feel extremely sorry for the victims of these senseless attacks. All they did was wake up and try to live their normal lives only to be shot down for no real reason."
