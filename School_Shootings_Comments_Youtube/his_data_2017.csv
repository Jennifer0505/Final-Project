"8","When I was a kid, I used to think that the teachers had a secret button under there desk that reveals a wall of hidden weapons full of Assault rifles and stuff so they could go full storm trooper on school shooters"
"9","I kind of want them to say “this is not a drill” even though it is to see if the kids and teachers payed attention to how to handle the situation but this could give so kids trauma so idk"
"10","When we do lock down drills at my school the teacher just locks the door and make sure no ones in the halls. They don't even turn the lights of we just keep going thourgh the lesson just with the door locked."

"17","these kids are pussies"
"18","back in my parent's now non existent country child predators had a bullet put into their head and guns were only military not civilian. dumb fucking americans, the problem is in the law. not only are ordinary people allowed to possess guns but teenagers too, thats what needs changing."

"22","Dang, my school drills aren’t this interesting. At my old school, all we did was hide in the corner of the classroom, turned off the lights, and locked the doors."
"23","school shooters went to schools. that why they know where all the kids are.

"24","3:40 I want to do that 
And take him down"
"25","It's so cute how the teachers really try to protect their students that just shows how much they love their job."
"26","My classmates during a drill they all freaking talk. Most of my teachers like me so they tell me if there’s a drill that day. But they are SO loud. My savage teacher said to one of the boys that if he did not stop talking she would put him in the hall way."
"27","my school got shoot"
"28","I remember having a school lockdown once. I was sitting near a bookshelf and grabbed a book from that shelf before hiding under my desk like everyone else. The insane man was armed with a baseball bat and I threw the book at him, and it missed. While he was distracted the teacher came and took him down. I got badly told off when I probably saved the lives of many kids.."
"29","You wait by the door and when they walk in you slam they head on the wall  pick they gun up and shoot em"
"30","I was in a real shooting in school last week but everyone was freaking out while the whole time I was thinking how to kill him but police got him"
"31","So now all the shooters know where the kids and students go.."

"41","Jody the teacher at the end she's like hell yeah I'm in this😂😂"
"42","They don’t need stupid drills like this if gun control is in place."
"43","Our teacher keeps a taser in her desk. Everyone mocked her for it. But one day, a man smashed a window and ended up in our class. She was so quick. She saved all of us that day, every month we all give her a gift to thank her."
"44","We wouldnt have to worry about it..if it wasnet for white people."
"45","At my school we literally just turn to the lights and hide in a corner, no one even knocks on the doors lol"
"46","they should put more guns in the schools to make them safer

dumb litbards won't do it though"
"47","Yeah all sit in a corner and make it easier for the shooter to kill more kids. That's anti-gun liberalism for ya. No self defense!"
"48","At 0:24 is the weapon real or fake?"
"49","only in America"

"56","This happened in Texas when my math teacher worked at the hs and they didn't tell them, and like kids needed to go into therapy cause they never told the kids what was happening and some of the kids were permanently scarred."
"57","Murica the land of school shooting and dead net neutrality."
"58","I like the idea but what about when a 110 pound girl jumps onto a 220 puns man. He’s gonna throw her through a damn wall or punch her through the floor"
"59","alright I'm 10 I was in karate for 5 years so I would stood right beside the door and chocked him out"
"60","Tip: don’t make fun of the white kid with sketchers."
"61","We need guns in every classroom. Every teacher should complete at least basic training and target practice."
"62","at my school we stand up because if there's somewhere far we have to evacuate the school cuz if he comes in but if he comes in we have to pick up chairs like we can grab a computer we can grab anything to throw it at him or her"
"63","at our school"
"64","Three years later we don’t go anywhere to hide we just continue work in a drill"
"65","If a school shooter was at my school...

Teacher:Be quiet students...
Class:*talks loudly*
Teacher:Be quiet i said...
class: *keeps talking*
Me:SHUT THE FUCK UP WE ARE GONNA DIE IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP!
class: *keeps talking*
Me: *Reaches into backpack*
Class: *Shuts up*"
"66","Does her Columbine Sweater say the shooters names?"
"67","Sad thing is, so often when a kid decides to shoot up the school, their motive is to kill. Not to threaten.

So huddling in a corner might increase your chance of survival for now, but i'd still take my chances by hoofing it. 
(He says while never having actually been in mortal danger.)"
"68","I don't get it. What is the ultimate main objective of those shooters intruding into schools and trying to shoot people?! Please get some help"
"69","Quick question, why the fk does my school use a nuclear siren to wane about a lockdown when they can announce it over the speakers"
"70","I would grab do what the teachers were doing then I smash the gun mans hand"

"72","my school had some one come in side with a wepon and the lock down was 1 hour long"

"74","I would fucking throw my chair at the school shooter!"
"75","""Oh my god! A shooter! Everyone get down! ""
Me: **smiles** I am ready to watch you all die and then die with you."
"76","One things I don't like about lockdown is that we all have to hide in one spot and sometimes this ugly kid is in front of me and his breath smells horrible. I have no idea how people even hangout with that guy"
"77","At our school we practice run hide, but never fight.  When we're hiding, we're told to bring something heavy as if we were gonna fight, though.  The really stupid thing is that when we're running, we exit one at a time in nice, orderly lines."
"78","It's easy! Just follow the rules... I seriously made that horrible joke, I'm so sorry 😑"
"79","In the vid the school is more likely to have less kid cause there doing it wrong"
"80","Is it me or does holly carpenter look like lily Shen from xcom 2"
"81","Omg lol"
"82","Last year in my agg  class we had a lockdown drill and at the end of it my teacher was literally like there's no real way of locking our door so if the shooter came in we basically pick up stuff and throw it at them"
"83","We had 30 min drill on time"
"84","I feel bad for the teacher in the colinbine school
Sorry I spelled it wrong"
"85","My teacher told me when this happens get something really heavy and through it at the then tackle them to the ground"
"86","BAN GUNS YOU STUPID AMERICANS"
"87","Guys the best way to survive a lock down is
Step 1: wait next to door side to side
Step 2: throw balls at him and scream
Step 3: throw him on floor
Step 4 : if he had a gun you realized you f****d up"
"88","0:48"
"89","I remember once we had a lock-down during my primary school years, these people were playing around with some guns around the church that was neighboring my school. The police were there and everything, keep in mind I was like 4 when this happened so this didn't impact or scare me as much as it would if it happened now."
"90","yeah make it easier to get shot good idea"
"91","After watching this I REALLY appreciate living in mexico, its rare that people use wepons (that dosn't mean that people never use wepons) for example: in an avarage rovery people will just sneek into the house or the shop, and just take everything they want 2 steel and after that they will just run for their lifes. Most of the time the worst event that could happen is having a fight with just a pair of inocent hands. :))"
"92","How would be in my school:

The entry class: *scream*
The teacher: *stars running for his life*
Me: that fucker
All the class: *screaming and running like idiots*

"101","This just teaches the shooter were to look for people."
"102","My classroom don’t have no shades my middle school broke as f"
"103","How dumb is this school? They could've expected children texting their parents and panic. They should've atleast warned the parents beforehand"
"104","I was on lockdown a week ago and it was serious"
"105","If a shooter comes into a classroom then why can't all the kids just grab a desk or a chair or even a freaken DICTIONARY and be like YEET!! Smack the bitch till he is only the floor and kick his balls/boobs. Because if we stay in one place in the classroom oh EASIER TARGET!! Great thanks"
"106","I’m sorry but throwing a desk or stapler isn’t gonna help stop the gunman/gunmen the
Adrenaline will be way too much.

Also I didn’t like how the girl and boy in the classroom drill were giggling. Seriously?! Ok I know the age immature but it’s no laughing matter regardless of age."
"107","I remember someone shouting ""TERRORIST!"" at a teacher walking past the classroom outside during my school lockdown drill... XD Principal was less than pleased"

"120","Substitute teachers need to be able to do the drills as well. Because our substitute teacher did not lock the door and did nothing because she didn't know what to do and didn't listen to us."
"121","doing 130? yea... dead kid and dead husband... what good is that going to do?"
"122","6:22 well if she does that she can say bye bye to her ankle down"
"123","If you Americans could only treat your classmates with kindness, then maybe all these School Shooting shit won't happen lol."
"124","When she was wrestling the guy it made my heart so warm I felt like she kinda was like this is for what you did to me and I'm not letting u do it again"
"125","Oh yeah, let's block the door and get behind the teacher's desk so that the shooter DEFINETELY doesn't kill us"

"133","so unneccesary with the fake blood and so on, they just want more drama... i dont think this is a good teaching methods.as a student i would be exited if i knew it was all fake. i wouldnt take it serious"
"134","Not only muslims u should talk about!!"
"135","*N O  O N E ' S  G E T T I N G  O U T*"
"136","Cringe"
"137","Or we could, you know, have more gun control."
"138","I support this training.  And for the people who disagree with this. Look up the Freeman High School shooting outside Spokane Washington just the 2nd day of the 2017 school year.  The shooter was incompassatated by the school Janitor!"
"139","If that happened to me I would break open the window with a chair and run home before the shooter got to my room"
"140","This is why I keep a pocket knife in my boot all the time"
"141","nah for real, my former algebra 1 teacher has a wooden baseball bat. someones in the hall, ta fucking da hes getting knocked out. we already have a plan. he knocks the gun out, and you pull the gun on him until the cops come."
"142","nah for real, i’d rather have a realistic drill if warned before hand."
"143","I wish my school would do these things"
"144","jesus christ this is a joke, just fix your fucking gun control problem and this shit training won't be needed."
"145","60 years ago, we did drills for foreign threats. These days we do drills for theats from our own soil."
"146","Teacher:""Tomorrow, there is going a to be a drill about school shooting!""
School shooter: ""oh can I pretend to be the school shooter?""
Teacher: ""okay!""
School shooter: ""great.""
*actually shoots up school*"
"147","What if he’s using his other arm to shoot?"
"148","what the fuck are they doing be by the door ready to attack and disarm the shooter"
"149","My school is ment to do this on Monday with a fake acter but I don't know i think there not that mean"
"150","I love that they run their drills like this. The kids need to know what it’s like."
"151","we’re in england and we’ve never ever done this before. we got a letter earlier this week saying that we will start practicing these lock downs. we will do our first one on monday and i am so so scared. i’ve never been so nervous. any tips ?"
"152","What the heck?? WHY SHOOTERS GO INSIDE SCHOOLS TO KILL STUDENTS IN SANDY HOOK R.I.P FOR THOSE 20 STUDENTS AND 6 TEACHERS AT SANDY HOOK AND CURSE ADAM LANZA THE SHOOTER OF THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL."
"153","My highschool (Aztec High school) had a shooting last week an we never even have these lockdown drills. But one of the students was going to the restroom an caught the gunman ino one of the stalls while he was gearing up an fucked up his plan, because he shot him alerting everyone. Our school really needs to have these drills to prepare everyone. RIP Paco & Casey."
"154","What if a real school shooter is there and they think its a drill?"
"155","Oh god 120 mph"
"156","Chicken Lurkin' Yung Chihuahua revenge , anger , paranoia"
"157","I think it's absolutely a thing they should do at schools, especially in these times. I never had a school shooting drill, and I would have had no idea what to do in that situation if it ever came to it."
"158","0:50 lol the guy waving at the camera 😂😂"
"159","They did that at my old school where like the guy had the fake gun and once they didn't say that it was a drill and it was really scary and my social studies teacher told us that if there ever is gonna be a shooter that it will most likely be a student and that since they know how the system works that we will probably get shot and this gave me major anxiety and I would have a panic attack every day before school (and keep in mind that this was in 6th grade I'm in 8th now) and I was an innocent little baby (11) and I didn't know about this kind of stuff because I didn't watch the news cuz my parents didn't think I needed to know about that stuff so young and I still get anxious in public places because of what they did I am always afraid about shooting and even in my own house I am scared about drive by shootings and these thoughts aren't just back of my mind thoughts these thoughts consume me... Luckily now I'm homeschooled and can be in my bedroom that is at the back of the house all day"
"160","Legit my class during an intruder drill (that’s what we call it, at least):

Teacher: shhhh is everyone be silent
Boys: I broke your ankles on the basketball court earlier today didn’t I?! 
Girls: I mean she be over here creating rumors but she finna get PUNCHED cuz I’m here and she won’t last

"163","I would just throw a scissor and if that doesn't work I'm dead"
"164","My school
Class: *talks*
Teacher: shhh we’ll be fine
Class: fine😡
Me: wow🙄"
"165","I actually a couple weeks ago was volunteering at my kids school when a teacher accidently pushed their panic button putting the school into code red. So we at the time had no idea it was an accident. Cops came assessed the situation and found out what happened. It was good practice. I was with k-2nd graders and they did great. It was very organized and everyone did what they were supposed to do. Doing this can save lives. The other volunteers and I didn't scare the kids either we stayed calm and collected as possible."
"166","If this was my school, we’re dead. There’s so many giggling and farting."
"167","I live in England and I'm always scared to go out of class to the restroom because what if those 5 sharp bells go that signify a lockdown and I can't get into a classroom and I'm trapped wondering the empty halls. Scares me to death!"
"168","who sits in a corner during a active school shooter just use the windows"
"169","I hade a lockdown at my school care it real"
"170","At lockdown drill

"171","1:18 ""RACED TO THE SCHOOL"""
"172","Omae wa mu shinduro



NANI??"
"173","Adam Lanza was the shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Conneitcut,Newtown"
"174","Obviously the teacher's desk is impenetrable"
"175","I think a teacher or student in each class should volunteer themself(ves) to stand by the door (out of sight) with some weapons like scissors"
"176","Lol that’s not the point even if I didn’t watch this if I was a killer I would kill the teacher first so they can’t get me commonsense"
"177","They honestly gotta do this at my school, most students in my class just giggle. -_-"
"178","Cringe"
"179","Lmao. If they'r reloading, me and my mates will just pick them up and drop them, easy said than done though.."
"180","""And I'm KINDA scared"" kinda? id be extremely scared :D"
"181","Our school doesn’t have an alarm or speaker and we don’t lock the doors so we’re not safe I’ve asked a few teachers what they would do if a shooter brakes in and they say honestly I don’t know"
"182","This would help with real panic and fear but this seems like a little bit of uhhhh overkill. You didn't tell the parents? Bad optics."
"183","All the boys at my school start singing Pumped Up Kicks whenever there's a lockdown drill, or real one for all we know, cause we aren't told if it's fake/real 😑"
"184","I once had a lockdown DRILL but I forgot to check the school calendar/planner so I was like ""oh jeez this is real I'm gonna die"""
"185","pumped up kicks"
"186","'Murica!"
"187","I'd be that kid that in the bathroom taking a crap while a school shooting is on"
"188","When there is a school shooting going on, you run. Don't just sit there while the shooter shoot's everyone one by one."
"189","Keep the doors locked"
"190",":’)"
"191","I’m small so I can hide behind a corner and duck and when the shooter comes they might not see me so I can just punch them in the balls, knock away the gun, kick them in the head and scream help so advantage of being small"
"192","In England we just have locks on the doors so the students don't steal the computers."
"193","Lmao"
"194","Sandy hook was a lie"
"195","When a school shooting would happen i wouldnt sit in the class i would run away and if doors would be on lockdown just fuck up a window like you aint gonna do shit with that training the shooter will shot you before you get close to him if they shot up a school they have no mercy"
"196","Maybe going inside the room is too far but the fake gun is fine I think."
"197","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS BETTER RUN BETTER RUN OUTRUN MY GUN"
"198","*gun man walks into room* 7:56 *THROWS TENNIS BALL FURIOUSLY*"
"199","But well, ABC, it's 2017 now.

The community will either school shooting jokes on this video, or they'll make a bunch of school shooting jokes NOT on this video.

The first one is disgusting, the second one is cowardly AND disgusting."
"200","I know waht it is like cuz I've been in one when I was in kinagarden the killer killed my princibul and I was right next to it and I was scared"
"201","There's only two students who get to have the gun in the bottom drawer of the desk students who are older than 18 and students who have filed a handgun safety report"
"202","It's locked in there the key is at the"
"203","My teacher actually keeps a gun in the bottom drawer of your desk just in case"
"204","they're having way too much fun for a drill thats supposed to save lives..."
"205","THE part with the  220 guy scared the crap out of me"
"206","OMG If it  were to happen in my school we'll be dead cause they don't have drills only fire drills and it seems like they do it once every 2 TERMS"
"207","But what if the shooter is an actual student (like Columbine) and knows what the teachers and students will do because they were in a drill before?"
"208","0:49 
The kid in the red backpack 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"209","3:50 why not throw things at the guy then get on top of him 
What if a teacher threw a chair or book then you'd get hurt too probably"
"210","in my school,the shootings are just a joke for the students."
"211","What if it a school shooter if it a man kick his dick  I dont' give a shit just ruin his man hood"
"212","One time we had a real lock down but when we went behind cubies  I got my pocket knife out of my backpack and  stabbed the guy in the foot"
"213","I play pumped up kicks over this all the time"
"214","School shorts don’t just carry one ☝️ gun they carry 5 to 10 guns"
"215","In my highschool in the UK when the drill happens they tell the students to come in the classrooms they lock the doors and close any blinds and tell us to hide in places. If there aren't any hiding spots they tell us to avoid the windows. This is smart as the killer would think that the rooms are vacant."
"216","This is why I always bring a camo suit with me :3"
"217","Parents need to understand coming to get their kids in a situation like this isn't going to fix it, it's only going to make it worse..."
"218","""Don't worry guys, I play mortal combat, I can fight these shooters off and give them a brutality!"""
"219","They should have used nerf guns."
"220","We can’t hide behind the desks anymore in my state because it’s unsafe."
"221","3;49 SAVAGE CLASSROOM"

"224","My teacher said if we ever have a real lockdown, (like if someone comes in the school with a weapon and will kill us) she will push us out the window and said we have to run as fast as we can"
"225","BOOOORING"
"226","I’m in England and we have lockdown drills now"
"227","That is so crazy and wrong that teachers have to train in this way.  I am a kindergarten teacher in New Zealand and we often have tsunami and fire drills. So I think that the teachers are doing the right thing by practicing lock down drills for the kids. When the children know what to do,  then there will hopefully be less injuries and deaths of children.  Recently we have been practicing the lock down procedures . But luckily    in NZ we have very strong gun control laws to protect the kids as well as the teachers as well as other people.   Scary  that we have to even consider this happening here.  Good luck and keep up the  lock down drills."
"228","Man my school was ass they don't even lock the damn doors"
"229","So let’s get this straight. The children are taught to cower in a locked room instead of running. What shooter is stupid enough to hear a lockdown drill on the intercom and say to himself, “They must not be at school at 12 a.m. on a school day” while the kids wait like sitting ducks to be murdered? Pure retardation."
"230","Me: SLEEPING 
Kid: bruh there’s a shooting going on 
Me: oh crap we better hide 

10 minuets later 
Quiet kid: (humming) all the other kids 
Me: he bout to do it bois"
"231","Fuck the school making the parents worry about their kids and wasting their time"
"232","In our school we just lock and barricade the doors. And if you're outside the classroom when it happens you have to either sneak out, hide somewhere or convince a teacher to let you in their classroom"
"233","1:21 not sponsored by Audi , no."
"234","maybe instead of trying to prepare for it just cut the root of the problem?
a.k.a stop the bullying.."
"235","She supports school shooting drills that are realistic"
"236","I feel so bad for these guys it must be so traumatizing."
"237","here is Australia when we have a lock down we hide under the fUCKING DESKS. 

because obviously no one can see you if you're under a desk with limbs and shit sticking out because the desk is so small."

"241","School shooting drills are like so dumb. It’s like go hide in a class and don’t get shot okay. Like it’s practically a ostrich hiding from an animal. What I did once in a drill was take my sock off and put a lock in it then swung it around. Btw I wasn’t told it was a drill. No one was."
"242","Are y'all for real? Like these kids are way too fucking quiet during a lockdown my class would be fucking screammming we'd all die cuz no one would shut up"

"249","Holly Carpenter.
I know you probably won't see this, but I just want to thank you.
I'm supposed to be doing homework but I somehow stumbled upon his video.
When you started talking about how when you look at these children, you think they're amazing and all that, it has inspired me.
I've always wanted to become an author but I know that might not pay well. And my writing isn't too good 😅
I've had several amazing teachers these past few years and they were the ones that sparked the idea of becoming a teacher. I love helping my classmates understand the work, I love helping my peers with their problems and like giving them advice. And when I thought about it, those are all things my teachers have done for me. At first I doubted the fact that I could be a teacher for several reasons. But you, Ms Holly Carpenter, have truly inspired me to become a teacher.
I will work hard and hopefully, one day, I'll be able to see students the way you see your students. Thank you 😊"

Teachers: FUCK! WE CANT ALL GIVE A 100 QUESTION TEST ON THE SAME DAY!"
"261","Ok so one time there was a shooter within 100 feet of the school. My teacher put belts around the door and gave us scissors. Then, my teacher said ""This guy can come in, *but I won't let him get out alive* ""."
"262","Lock down drills are basically useless. You should barricade the doors and seek an exit . A school shooter isn’t going to be fooled into thinking no one is in a classroom just because the lights are off."
"263","These lockdowns are kinda stupid though no one would do this they would just all mass panic and even if they did the shooter could just shoot open the lock and kill everyone with ZERO survivors since no one ran.
What I’m saying is ignore everyone and run get out if you can’t get out save other hide and jump the shooter and try to steal his gun or distract him."

"274","I hope the officers kick those criminals' ass"
"275","They should tell the parents if they are going to do a drill like that.  I get they want the children to feel it, but the parents should be informed.

Adittional note, I am 110% for the teaching of defense and gun safety etc to staff and teachers.  As mentioned, it empowers the teachers, as they feel they have some sort of small amount of control.  In the right circumstances, they can actually make a difference.  And, being informed, they know when would be the time to do something, and when it is better to run."
"276","I think this isnt very clever because students might think that an actual schoo shooting is just a drill"

"287","here is the problem with not trying to eliminate a gunman or terrorist . 
He will continue to murder even more people and will kill you anyways . 

if you have a group of people in a room and no escape , barricade , arm yourselves and stay spread out and have your most fighting capable people near that door if you have a fire extinguisher use it to blind the attacker and have some guys ready to melee engage to get that gun out of his hands and into your hands and kill the attacker. 
The sooner you get that gun out of his hands the more people may survive."
"288","Tell me why my evil ass think this shit in the begging look mad lit 🤔🤔"
"289","We had a drill lockdown at my school. There are usually two classrooms next to each other, the walls between them are glass and so are the doors. Wouldn't the shooter be able to see us crouching behind our flipped tables through the glass and shoot us??? That drill lasted for about 40 minutes. I was crouching behind my desk, unable to look up. I could hear some faint talking. Then I realised my phone was playing a video I was watching earlier video in the morning... I survived! But seriously, this way of dealing with a shooter is stupid"
"290","And this is why my physics teacher holds a 75 lb weight in her cabinet."
"291","Your just teaching future school shooters where the kids hide and where the teachers gonna jump you from"
"292","I'd have bolted out of there idgaf if the teachers tell me to hide or some shit I'm hopping out the windows and bolting. I'd run"
"293","When school shooting happens:

Teatcher: guys get down where having a lockdown and is not a drill

Teatcher:(👆 holds hand up to his lips)

And up north and in the country areas we have a lot of wildlife that waltz through town, in FL we have cyottes and big cats, not to mention wild hogs, and the gators.

Schools in here also have shooting drills but young New Zealanders don't take it seriously.

"440","When i was a freshman, we were having a drill, and the principal forgot to tell us that it was over and we were all so scared. We were in it for like 2 hours"
"441","So the solution to an active shooter is to crouch down and crowd in a corner? Talk about an easy target. Amazing how this is still practiced in our schools, they are setting kids up to die. They need to run from the shooter and leave the area, not stick around the area and wait for the shooter to find you."

"459","This is why my high school semantics teacher kept a sledgehammer and a microwave in the closet “just in case.”"
"460","OK I know that this video was 3 years ago but, there's this thing called A.L.I.C.E. This is the lock down system we practiced today.        11/17/17.
A- Alert/ anyone in the office comes on the intercom and  Tells you where the killer is at all times but if they get targeted first you'll have to do without.
L- Lock down/ Lock your doors and Barricade them so that the killer cant open your door and they cant shoot.
I- Inform. The people will be in the office and tell you where the killer is and whether to evacuate or not.
C- Counter/ Throw anything. ANYTHING!!! Shank them with scissors jump on him throw textbooks anything that will make your chance higher of surviving. My teachers said throw anything they don't care what, computers, chromebooks, calculators, chairs, desks anything that you can find. They care more about you than the chromebooks of the calculators or phones. The teachers and the school will replace it as long as you can defend yourself and you can hurt them of save yourself then throw anything you got.
E- EVACUATE!!!/ On inform the office is supposed to inform where the killer is at all times no pauses repeating themselves until they can say something else. If you have a school like mine. There is an 8th grade building and a 7th grade building. If they say the killer(s) are in the 7th grade and your'e in the 7th grade don't move and stay with LOCKDOWN AND COUNTER. But, if you're in the 8th EVACUATE!!! Run to the woods run to the nearest store. If you drop your phone or your purse leave it behind your life is more important than leaving a phone of money behind. Don't bring protection with you. If you protected yourself with a thick textbook then drop it and run take nothing that will slow you down. Run and hide in the woods or in a store call for help if you have your phone. My superintendent and Principal said if you run and hide we WILL find you later. You might be there for hours but if you have your phone call 911 call your parents call someone who can help!
   Just remember you guys, the old lock down system is bad; locking the door, hiding in the corner; if the killer got the master keys he could open your door and KILL YOU ALL. Stay safe because if you get the chance to evacuate during a drill, or the real thing run, and run as fast as you can, as far as you can, and hide in a safe place. The school will find you no matter what. They will send a search team for you if they don't find you. 
   The teachers will probally be trained before this drill but it will hopefully save your life. ALICE Alice the new way fro lock downs."
"461","School nearly gives a parent a fine and he could have died just to find out it was a drill Just logic"

He killed 4 teachers and 56 - 58 children. He shot 3 Pre -schoolers and 6 Kindergartners. Thats what I heard, he almost shot me but if I hadn't ducked around the corner in time I would be dead but thankfully my instincts are better than that"

"474","lmao if a school shooter wanted to kill ppl easily all he has to do is pull the fire alarm thingy for everyone to go out. hopefully i havent given any pyschos a way to easily kill ppl"
"475","I graduated hs in 2016 and in the last few years, they changed the policy to barricade the door with desks and chairs instead of just hiding in the corner and staying quiet and to fight back if they did get through the door. It also reminds me when the teacher didn't properly lock the door during a drill back in middle school and the SRO opened the door and said, you are all dead and the teacher started crying after the drill ended."

"479","My school lockdown drills are like 10 to 20 minutes"
"480","Omahgod there is a reason y schools tell u never to use ur phones on a drill. It doesnt matter if its real or not cuz parents will rush to the streets and will block the pathway for police officers. And if ur gonna bash me for being an idiot cuz its ur child, this happened at my neighbourhood a couple years ago."

"484","They should use C02 powered airsoft guns to simulate gunfire"
"485","At least lock the door!"
"486","This reporter and those parents that don’t like this are a bunch of fucking pussys"
"487","Is this even a question? We should definitely fight back. What are we supposed to do? Let them kill us without putting up a fight? If in every classroom they fight back the shooter isn't going to get far."
"488","We've never had a drill and only one time has the principal came to our house our class I meant to show us what we would do and he showed us where the door blocker was and he told us all to find an object we would throw in case the person broke in so we would know that if they broke in"

"517","Here in britain I've only ever had to do 1 lock down drill. One of the teachers went  into the hall and pressed and air horn so the whole school could here and then we just closed r6he blinds and hid under the the tables. We don't even have a lock on our door to keep it shut. It's kind of stupid."
"518","I wish this was my drill, all we do is stay quietly in our seats and keep doing our work it makes me feel uncomfortable"
"519","If its a guy shooter you need to take down, its easy. Just kick him in the nuts and drop a desk on his head."
"520","When I was in elementary we had a real lockdown. Usually every year during a certain month we would have a lockdown. The principal and staff would come try and open the door. If they couldn’t, they would leave. But one day, the principal announced a lockdown without saying it was a drill. She had a worried tone in her voice. The teacher acted as fast as possible. We got real quite. This time it was really long and no one came to open the door. All we could hear was footsteps down the outside hall. It was terrifying. We asked if it was a drill after it was over to our teacher. She didn’t answer and continued teaching the lesson."

"531","Why am I here? I live in England and we don't have lockdowns lol"
"532","It's good for kids to be put into stressful situations like this, so they can understand how to handle them when the time arrives."
"533","As a student, Id believe this to be very beneficial to those around me and me myself, and also the teachers that teach. I've never had a lockdown drill for this, but I do think it should be implimented into every school to prevent more deaths for when shootings DO happen, because they do. There should be more to stop the assailant commiting the crime, rather than just hiding. I understand most students cannot risk their lives for a thing, but teachers are there to protect."
"534","I go to Christian school (important to story) and we were in my fav teacher's class when on the speaker the dean said ""we are on code red, this is not a drill"" I FUCKING FELT LIKE DYING! All the boys were joking around and stuff and the girls were asking questions. Then I asked my teacher, ""what do we do while we wait here?"" And she said ""Sing and pray to Jesus we don't die!"" And I was like, what would you do if the shooter comes here? And she was like ""listen sweetly, I am a very heavy woman, if I jump on him I would save the whole school."" Everyone was dying in my class and it was THANKFULLY  it was a drill"

"602","-Real shooter walks in with real gun."
"603","1 shooting a month!!!! Seriously America!? Children shouldn't ever have to experience real shootings or pretend ones. In my school we have fire drills that's it! If you have to prepare CHILDREN for a SHOOTING that's when you know you have a PROBLEM. Yes you guys have the right to bear arms but you don't have to and you don't need to! I can't be bothered to turn on the news anymore because it's just 'ANOTHER shooting in America'. I never go to school thinking if I'm gonna get shot because the only time I've seen a real gun is when I went to America. When do you hear of a mass school shooting in the UK? Extremely rarely and the last being in 1996. But what changes did we see because of that shooting? Tighter gun control obviously but you guys in America? No you're 'not gonna talk about that today' or tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Next year?! When will you do something about this!!? Innocents are being slaughtered. Your children, your parents, your brothers, sisters, your friends. Open your eyes. You'll have to make the change because the world doesn't seem to be able to get through to you despite us singing it from the rooftops! 

It's a school not a shooting range."
"604","“He was doing 130” ok..."
"605","Or every class could have a taser in a special place where only the teacher knows it is, so when the person comes, the teacher hides, jumps out and then tases the schoolshooter"
"606","Another thing is schools aren't really required to tell kids it's not a drill during the real thing. I'm in 9th grade but I remember this day as clear as if it were yesterday; it was just a ordinary day, I was in 1st or 2nd grade, and on the loud speakers they said it was a ""Hard lockdown"". ((Idk if this is everywhere, but here in NYC we have two types of lockdowns: a 'soft' lockdown, meaning the threat is outside the building and all we have to do is move away from windows and proceed with the class, and a 'hard' lockdown, which means it's in the building and we do the whole turning off the lights and hiding procedure)) Now, our teachers told us it was only a drill, So now the room is filled with a bunch of excited little kids, running to corners w their best friends, but instead the teachers tell us to go inside the closet. So here we are giggling and whispering and doing other dumb bullshit cuz it's a drill, and our teachers are getting rlly mad telling us to shut up, but that just makes us laugh more.After a few moments, they tell us it's been lifted, and when we go back to our desks me and the kids at my table see, through the door window, one of our school security gaurds walking by with a handcuffed guy. We got all excited cuz we were dumbasses and so I said ""Teacher!! ((I forgot her name lmao)) it was real!!! We saw the gaurd with a handcuffed guy!!"" And the teacher talked down on me and said ""No sweetie it was just a drill"" like I would just accept that I was hallucinating. We argued back and forth until she said she'd get me in trouble if I kept arguing. I told my mom, but she wasn't really listening at the time. 

Years later I told her about it again, and she acted surprised and said the school never told her about this. Then again, the school never told my mom when my sister, who now goes to this school, choked and vommited during school, or when another kid choked, or when my library teacher was arrested. 

Bottom line, we could have gotten killed because they didn't tell us it was real, and the fact that they didn't tell the parents about the situation either, to me, just feels wrong. Idk, but the fact that they didn't tell us STILL gets me mad, to this day."
"607","RAINBOW MOSTER WHO is saddcd😢😭😭😢"
"608","0:49 lol"
"609","Trauma my fucking ass"
"610","What if the shooter watches this to know what to do to kill the most people?"
"611","Need this for every school in every state. Literally training every year all teachers go to get training. Our last hope. And getting rid of guns."
"612","Who else would  throw that tennis ball at a teacher"
"613","Why don’t the teachers stand to the walls next to the door and then tackle them like shown? That’s so much more effective."
"614","our school said to turn off the lights,lock the door, and hide"
"615","At my old school we had a lock down ,because there was a criminal in the neighbor hood of the school(nothing serious happened he/she just banged on the front doors of the school)"
"616","They don't have those at my school"
"617","We had a lockdown in 3rd grade because a guy was being chased by the police and he was running around our grass area at our school (it was pretty big larger than a football field) and the police were running around chasing him. It was honestly sort of dumb it's because the guy didn't stop at a stop sign or smth. We never got exact details. But the police and the guy looked like a cats and a mouse. They eventually got him and we resumed our day as nothing had happened."
"618","So my most recent lockdown drill had me HIDING UNDER A DESK NEAR A BACK CORNER, A SECURITY GUARD KNOCKING ON DOORS MOST KIDS SCREAMING AND CRYING STAYING THERE FOR A LONG TIME. AND KIDS HUGGING NE"
"619","This is why the teachers should carry around firesrms"
"620","If it was me faking it i would have a water gun lol"
"621","At my school, we have a choice to either run if the shooter is far enough away from the closet exit, or we have the choice to stay back and fight. Both aren't great, but it's our options"
"622","“Inlist the football team”bitch what about the wrestling team"
"623","Any wrestlers it there that cringed as hard as I did"
"624","I dont see how going behind the desk helps"
"625","ive never got a shooting drill in middle school. even tho we got shot at 3 times. cheap ass school almost got kids killed 3 times! stupid highschoolers. good thing we only got hurt! pussy ass teachers hid themselves and ignored us evry time. i hate school. i relly do."
"626","Brush these kids are so well behaved my class is like the spawn of hell"
"627","At my school we don’t hide in one corner we’re spread out and quiet with lights off and depending on the teacher(6th and under) you can attack but now jr high students (8th and 7th) we’re allowed to attack and use anything as a weapon"
"628","That would actually make people take it seriously though?"
"629","6:13 if my teacher did that I will join her"
"630","we don't do this anymore it's outdated"
"631","Oh no, someone walked into the school with a submachine gun. Quick kids, hide under the desks and turn out the lights while I tell the news!"
"632","6:00 SURVIVAL"
"633","What if the shooter stand 21 foot how can they fight back"
"634","OML I had a scenario just like this at school, it was a normal day just in 1st period math class, I’m there using the I pad playing games on free time. Until on the intercom the principals voice was shaking in fear that we are going on lock down, I was shook. We figured that it was not a drill (edit) I was there shaking for 30-40 minuets in fear. After that we had to skip 2nd period and go straight to 3rd, I was pretty worried because I was listening to pumped up kicks while it was happening."
"635","Our school says to run I'm pretty shure they just tryan to kill us all off"
"636","I remember, when my class did a lockdown (DRILL) I was almost crying, and hyperventilating, we were hid in the supply closet, and I was claustrophobic, and the room was barely big enough to fill half the class, EVEN THOUGH I knew it was a drill Xd"

"638","0:49"
"639","I would act like it's nothing but I would probably have a panic attack."
"640","Snowflakes"
"641","At my school we had 2 real lockdowns that lasted 45 minuets each. One was because someone had a knife and was going to stab someone but we thought it was a drill so half the class was yelling and stuff. But I was like nah cause I wasn’t trying to die. And then just last week someone died a couple minutes away from the school so the police were called and they made us stay inside. To be honest I didn’t think that high school would involve a lot of real lockdowns. But it may only be mine."
"642","Those teachers aren't going to be able to do shit even if a below average sized male student walks in."
"643","They should be able to find out which part of the school the shooter is in and LEAVE THE BUILDING through the closest door away from the shooter.

No person shooting up a school is gonna actually exit the place until the job is done."
"644","Lol if they can’t handle it they will not survive a shooting"

"655","This is not how you should do a lock down. You need to spread put and lay down away from the door. If you stay huddled in a group you just make yourself a bigger target. Also the police have a five minute response so you just need to stay safe for five minutes."
"656","Wouldn't pulling down those shades at the door show the shooter exactly which rooms have kids inside?"
"657","Let's all become sitting ducks great idea"
"658","When there is a lock down at my school no one is ever quiet"
"659","This would be my school during a lockdown

Class:why?
Class:were having a conversation 
Me *thinks* shut it girl
Shooter:looks in class room window

"660","I hate when our school does lockdown drills because people always laugh there ass off and they don't tell us when the lockdown is real or a drill so other kids laugh and there could be somebody right at the door hearing us laugh and they don't tell that it's a drill or a real lockdown"

"674","we have a lockdown drill and all of us just kinda snapchat each other and sleep"
"675","is it save if your in a hall way and a drill was going on is it safe to go into a locker?"
"676","Fighting like that over a gun seems dangerous... Like it will most likely go off and someone is getting shot because you tried to be a hero. I was in a situation at school that could have gotten really bad, someone brought a sawed off shotgun to school one day. No sane untrained person would run at them. It's stupid."
"677","These are so important. We did them all the time in middle school and high school. With all the gun violence going on now, it's better to be safe than sorry."

"688","My teacher was a police too. There was a Shooter inside and the principal forgot to tell them to hide. The vice principal was killed. The shooter walked inside and shot my leg. As soon as the teacher noticed the bullet he grabbed a tazer and tazed him. After the police came he took me to the hospital. I was saved by my teacher"
"689","Its not that easy"
"690","this is why I want to bring a gun in my backpack"
"691","We had a drill like this. Of course I had no idea at the time and a dude actually came in with a gun. Most of my friends were crying, I wasn't shivering and the boys were helping and taking cover. I stood up and ACTUALLY jumped out a thin window. But we were on the third floor and there is a roof there so I went on the roof and some kids followed. The teachers shoved themselves in front of the boys and all the girls were outside. The man  told us it was a drill to come inside and that we were smart.

I'm actually surprised they didn't yell at me for going on the roof. Sure there was more of a chance of dying but he didn't see me climb out. He saw the other kids following.

Just a warning.... if if it's a drill act serious. Just if you KNOW it's a drill stay put. If not, and unexpected then do whatever you can. Run, run like the wind. Punch him in the balls, punch woman in the boobs, idk... but serious anything as out if there! Don't be socially awkward and just run! Heck, you would live... you would get to go do things you still have time to do... and you didn't die.

"701","Dance 0:49"
"702","Do you guys know why school shootings (and shootings outside of school for that matter) are so frequent in the U.S? They're a pretty rare thing in countries like England. That's because guns are allowed in the U.S. If they weren't open to the public for purchase, there wouldn't be a reason for them to be legal in the first place. If guns were illegal, you wouldn't need one to defend yourself. In England, where I live, you aren't allowed to just get a gun by getting a license for it. That's why school shootings are so rare here."

It was a normal morning I'm getting the stuff out of my locker while others are doing the same too or walking in the hallway. Then all of a sudden there is this beeping noise and that means there is an intruder. But turns out the office lady hit the button by accident. Meanwhile kids are running around and screaming. Eventually she told us it wasn't real. Then up to 2nd period the beeping noise is still on!"

First off, how the fuck are you going to say fighting back is a bad thing? For fuck sakes sitting under a desk with no chance of survival if a shooter coming in or atleast some chance that you take him down and or something is better than nothing. Second off, ""your asking people to be heros."" No your not, your asking people to know how to protect themselves instead of getting killed unprepared. And the teacher who wrote about ""Rehearsing Death"" would you rather rehearse something and maybe have a chance of survival or just die waiting for something else to come. Seriously this is so fucking stupid. I admit sometimes it can go overboard with ""realisticness"" but to remove all the drills and just let people die. I rather fight for my life then let death take me with other people."

"756","My school did lockdown drills where we hid under desks as well, but now we barricade the doors and try to get out of the school through a window or something and run to a designated safe point. We obviously don't jump out the windows in the drill and run though. If the shooter comes near the classroom where your in, people would have things to throw and stuff like the video showed."

"825","One time in 6th grade, I had an panic attack during a lockdown drill. It was because the secretary didn’t say it was a drill. We were all huddled in a corner. All of our phones were on the other side of the room. Me and my friends were holding hands and quietly crying. I have Asthma so it didn’t help when I started hyperventilating. I had to bury my head in my friends shirt to muffle the sound. We all looked to my teacher and asked if it was a drill. “I don’t know...” he kept saying. He looked so worried... Someone stood up and said, “can we get our phones and text our parents.” “No.” It was a good answer, considering the phone holder was right next to a large window next to the door. Plus it would make too much noise to get there. I wanted to cry my heart out... What if I died right here?? Would anyone miss me? I wanted to run to my desk and curl under it all alone in peace. But I couldn’t. Too risky. Someone started banging on the door. We all jumped. I whispered “what the hells going on???” I was about to die so it didn’t matter what I said anymore. “We were all shaking and crying.” Until after about an hour, the secretary came back into the speaker. “You can resume to regular classes now. The drill is over.” I literally collapsed onto the floor shaking."

"840","These fucking teachers know it might not be a drill and still fucking talk through it"
"841","The training will get someone killed. In a life or death fight the offender will do anything and everything to get away. And if they’re already there to kill them, they don’t have a chance. 
As a retired police officer with many hours of active shooter training I can tell you this is setting up people to be killed faster. If someone comes in with intentions to kill nothing these people trained for will stop them. 
The last fight I had was w a wanted felon who didn’t want to go back to prison. 
I ended up with a fractured vertebrae in my neck, separated shoulder and broke back. I’ve had 13 surgeries with 7 of them being on my back. 
All he did was try to get away. He didn’t have intentions of killing me. 
Throwing objects at a shooter will not deter him only make him more bold. 
Teach the teachers how to effectively use a firearm and arm them. If he pops into a room with an armed teacher they could save lives."

"852","Nobody is gonna follow the drill rules when you're in the moment lol. ""Stay and hide."" Funny joke, ain't nobody bout to do that shit. People are gonna be running faster then Usain Bolt to get out of there. Hell, kids are gonna be breaking windows to get out. Unless you have to, or if you think there's a group outside, then nobody's bout to hide."

Me: *plays pumped up kicks with no regrets*"
"855","all my classes had windows"
"856","so If I wanted to in a drill could I just hide behind the door then run out when he comes in to shoot everybody?"
"857","We are in middle school and they don't tell us its a drill but recently last school year in 7th grade we had 2 real fire drills but they weren't serious buuuttt are school went on fire during the summer but that wasn't bad either b/c we are in the shitty place now ;-;"
"858","I want a school lockdown"
"859","At my school, whenever we have a lockdown, we’re told to grab heavy books or scissors to protect ourselves in case the shooter comes in the room."

"861","I'd sit in the middle of the hallway screaming, YEEEAAAAHHH BOIIIIIIII"
"862","I don't like the idea of hiding under your fucking desk during a lockdown, break a fucking window and get the fuck outta there it's common fucking sense, you're just a sitting duck if just hide."
"863","While I would be throwing chairs at the shooter"
"864","We had a man walking around my school with something in his hand and had a lockdown and like we had a lockdown a few days before we thought it was fake they message everyone’s parents (and mine) and we heard polices outside and I was like “shit why scaring children like us” when we heard are principal starting saying “the lockdown is over this was not a drill for now we have a lock out” fuck that man"

"874","my mom wouldn’t even come to the school lmfaoooo"
"875","well a phone won’t do too much. if you were to contact your parents, they’d most likely come to the school in search of you and end up shot. also the secretary or someone in the office would be able to dial 911. stay safe, and think smart."
"876","Sorry couldn’t finish"
"877","And they say it’s a drill"
"878","Im in 5th grade but I in yr so so england"

"882","I don't like how they teach us to just wait in the corner of the class thinking we're going to be all right when this shooter could easily shoot the handle off the door and come in I think we should get things to throw and attack them"
"883","I would've have yelled my butt off if I heard the gun, or I would beat the crap out of the shooter."
"884","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run, better run, outrun my gun."
"885","First world problems huh?"
"886","I wanna be in a actual school shooting and run out of the door to the shooter and say “give me a gun. This school is fucking dead. Fuckers should be shot” and then grab my trench coat, put it on, and go full columbine on the place. Rip Eric 4/9/81-4/20/99 and Dylan 9/11/81-4/20/99"
"887","You guys should tell me where was this at the butt literally I have machine gun that can go fast I only bring it out when people trying to kill me or trying to kill my family or kids got to go back to high school"

"892","Wow, at my school the teachers just throw all of us in one corner where we could all be killed in 20 seconds."
"893","7:55 Lmao the teacher the farthest to the left, her throw though."
"894","I want to point out that during the disarming where the officer fought back, she had the barrel pointed at herself multiple times. She would be shot, making that exercise ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to execute."
"895","I don’t understand the point of the blinds the shooter already knows theres gonna be people in a room"
"896","Drills should be done without warnings...
If a real shooter were to come to your school, there won't be any prior warning..."
"897","I thought every school was supposed to have these drills. But I think they should notify the parents"
"898","when I rode the bus this one middle school kid I knew threatened another with a knife earlier in the day that he had snuck into school, and he went and sat next to him on the bus on the way home. Because it was a serious threat the kid I was sitting next to (who was the brother of the kid who got threatened) was quietly freaking out, and handed me a note to give to our bus driver who called the cops and the kid who threatened the other kid got arrested cuz he still had the knives. Thank god he didn't do anything. He was right there man...right there..."
"899","Omg at the end was the funniest I almost died from laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"

"903","TRIGGERED"
"904","Lol when the shooter walks in and everyone’s in a corner he’ll probably be like, “DAMN IM ABOUT TO GET THIS SICK KILL FEED WITH MY M1911"
"905","At my school.we have 3 choices.hiding,escaping,or fighting back"
"906","I like how they just throw hundreds of tennis balls at the shooter. New Security Device: 2017"
"907","In my school pne time they forgot to say it was a drill and it was almost the whole class which is an hour and we got told by another teacher to come quickly and quietly into another classroom that was safer then the other and we heard a siren go by and everyone was freaking out because we all thoufht it was real and so did the teacher and then the principle tried opening the door and we all had to scream a minute later they said we are all good and we are very sorry we forgot to mention it was a drill. I did not go to school the next day"
"908","Lol in England we have never had a drill for school shootings"
"909","Our elamantry school principal mr.lawson does an anccoument on the speaker if it's a active shooter he says, ""ACTIVE SHOOTER ACTIVE SHOOTER TAKE COVER IN YOUR COATROOMS!"" If it's a drill he says ""DRILL DRILL COATROOMS PLEASE!"""
"910","lol one time i speared and punched the real shooter and took his gun lol haha ok"
"911","Damn seeing her fight that guy at 6:10 brought me to tears
Our teachers are amazing and the things they're willing to do for the kids is just beautiful"
"912","My son's autistic and in second grade his classes have these a couple times a year. I worry about him doing this or worse if anything really happened how he'd react"
"913","Jesus fucking chirst, even a simple fire drill traumatized me when I was younger, because it was meant to be a drill but there was a real small fire. But to have actual people pretend to bleed and die around me would never leave me the same. Thank God I don't live in America;;"
"914","i actually want to learn martial arts and self defence.. but i can't... and my dad probably won't lemme. T^T"

"918","I once had a lock down because there was a man outside my school shooting gophers







Lmao"
"919","We had a code Red drill (aka lockdown/ intruder on site) and I started silently sobbing in a corner next to my classmates and had a panic attack. Felt so stupid when they told me it was fake."
"920","Yea all hide in a corner so when a shooter comes in he can spray all them down that's a very smart idea"
"921","stop bullying and it wont fucking happen"
"922","u know how teachers say ok now if a man is in here trying to kill you we all are going to stay in one spot which will be an easy target to kill us all  C: if there was a real drill I  be like BUMP THIS and prob climb in the ceiling ."
"923","When the white kid loses Kahoot."
"924","I swear I’m gonna be in an actual situation and that one kid who doesn’t care and screams “PLEASE DONT RAPE ME IM JUST A LITTLE BOY!”"
"925","Lol imagine a lockdown and then at the same time a firealarm goes off"
"926","My schools retarded cause they have a repeated thing that says there’s a lockdown so it’s basically telling the shooter it’s time to play hide and seek"
"927","Like if tiny balls r gonna knock that shooter down😂"
"928","My school uses Alice"
"929","U know what? I FUCKING HATE THAT THE KEEP US IN A CORNER AND WE CANT EVEN ATTEMPT TO FIGHT BACK CAUSE IF HE OR SHE COMES IN WITH A GUN, WE ALL DIE IF WE ARE IN A CORNER!!!!!! stop this shit and give da teachers a gun. OH AND TEACH THEM TO FUCKING SHOOT IT!!! I SWEAR!!!"
"930","All I need to do is either m1911 in my backpack or tackle him into a chair"
"931","Why can't every school do this?!?!"
"932","Think about this: Over 200 kids in almost ever school right? Almost all those schools have sharp items right? Who would win 200 kids with sharp items or one guy with a 15 mag gun? I think you know who would win."
"933","How about you quit showing it to the public"
"934","What about taking away guns?"
"935","Bro, I broke my foot during Physical education the day my school had a lockdown drill so I had to stay in the nurse without being able to leave to the hospital for like 30 min
:/"
"936","Our lockdown drill at our highschool changed. We're to turn out the lights, and barricade the door(s). Our school doesn't have windows. Then we spread out around the room, armed with a weapon. When the shooter enters, we all attack him with our weapons, and we spread out so it's harder to shoot more of us."
"937","They didn't blare pumped up kids wtf"
"938","Is this what really happened at Sandy Hook? A surprise drill gone wrong? That'd explain the cover up and the obvious signs that the official story is complete B.S."

"950","i saws the guy too"
"951","1. Why would they keep the doors' to the classrooms open? Or was that just of the training- part?"

"961","If kids are the ones doing the shooting then why the hell do they do the same exact thing"
"962","At our school we have ropes we tie around the door knob then we pull our bodies against the wall to keep the door shut even when locked"
"963","Lol yeah I saw the kid dancing"
"964","When that dude was actually trying he wasn't trying at all he would of shot the fuck outta her"
"965","This shooter training shit is not going to work against an actual grown ass man going in there with a gun like dafuq😂😂"
"966","This is fuvked up who the fuck would fucking have everyone hide in a corner just to make it easier for them to shoot you if I heard about someone coming into the school I would be waiting behind the door with something that would knock a nigga out tf if there was a real school shooting at our school fuck the teacher is she says to hide in the corner"
"967","To the rest of the world it's just fucking madness that 'school shooting drills' even exist because you have 1 fucking mass shooting every fucking month... Most other civilized countries have ZERO. Fix your mental healthcare system and fix your gunlaws so you won't need this shit."
"968","What if there was another gun in the other hand? What will happen?"
"969","""He was doing 130"" Yeah no he might have been doing 95 or so but not 130"
"970","My school did the same thing we would throw stuff at the cop and block the door with desks and if he came in to the room we would get out the window.  And honestly it was kind of fun"
"971","I had a drill of a lockdown and I was under the backpacks. I asked my teacher""what is a lockdown?"" She said""when there is a shooter inside"" and everyone went like""oooooohhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!""

"1004","Oh u were in Colorado...."
"1005","Did anyone else think about how useless those disarming tactics were? I mean in that possition she was in the gunman could have easily snapped her neck, they need to know that these guys are for real and you can’t send small teachers to defend the school with even three teachers at the same time you gotta remember he’s got a gun"
"1006","To someone screaming ""I want to go home!"""
"1007","5 minutes!? One time I had a lock down drill where it lasted like 30 mins after school while listening"

"1017","I remember one of my school's actually had a code for lockdowns in which they would ask for a fake teacher to come down to the main office. I'm not 100% sure, but if I remember correctly, the last name used was actually the maiden name of the wife of the President our school was named after."
"1018","This should come with a trigger warning, seriously. I just got an anxiety attack from watching 30 sec into it, even if it is fake...just cried my eyes out. Why just why kids?!!! They are the most purest and precious things in the world. I don't even want to go there with gun control just stop giving these fucking weapons to these fucking sickos of the world once and for all, why is this even up for debate!!!!!! Fuckkkkkk"
"1019","I feel like they should have one of these at every school. That way students, faculty, and police can have the knowledge or training if a school shooting should occur."
"1020","are you fucking serious........ i thought Jamaica was bad but y'all have terrible evil people that you need to have drills for this............ sad"
"1021","I can actually flip a guy over because my uncle that’s in the military, showed me techniques so if they pull out a gun, you’re supposed to quickly grab and twist their arm and them put your foot in front of theirs when they are behind you and the pull the arm over and take the weapon from their hands"

Everybody shouts
Students: AHHHHHH
Me: omg they are doing it but I'm at behind!!!!
After the shooter went away
I finally calm down cuz I was scared when the shooter shoot me 
The end"
"1085","Ahh I live in Colorado < does it really matter? And oddly enough I loved lock down because everyone had to be quite and sit in the dark, I was never scared untill it was actually real, and it was easy to tell the difference between real and fake"
"1086","You grab a chair and throw them at their heads and make them have a cuncoution"
"1087","0:49"
"1088","This is sickening must be a lib idea to for gun control. Bullshit"
"1089","Seriously though I would bite if I had to, scratch that if I want to."
"1090","My school had one on Friday, (a drill) one kid was crying, and everyone was squishing together XD"
"1091","I'm fast as fuck boiiiiiiiii"
"1092","Props for the man who did 130 on the road to save his kid. 👏"
"1093","Quickly pin them down."
"1094","Hehehe Muppies better safe than sorry"
"1095","Welcome to America :P"
"1096","Hehehe Muppies that’s true. America sucks (coming from an American)"
"1097","Once in 4th grade we were under a code red for 2 hours because there was a shooter in the neighboring community and we could hear the gun shots 🙃"
"1098","What the heck I will be scared too"
"1099","My teacher needs to see this"
"1100","Longest u had was 5 minutes? My school literally had 1 and a half hours"
"1101","Jackie Chan mode: *On.*"
"1102","5 minutes?! MINE TAKES LIKE AN HOUR WHAT"
"1103","Why wouldn't you just jump through a window and run?"
"1104","Maybe schools should not have shades for doors it makes it obvious that the criminal would think there are definitely someone in  
There smart way of thinking"
"1105","Must I have to sit in a corner and wait for the shooter to shoot me?"
"1106","0:49"
"1107","0.49"
"1108","If I get this in school I will bite her/his leg really hard because I like biting :)"
"1109","Wtf our school says ""we'll be having a drill sometime this week but only the bell ringers will know when"" rather than having it completely unannounced and scaring the bejeezus out of us
Also they send the drama kids around screaming and bashing on doors pleading for help and if anyone opens the door they just break character, say ""you're all dead"", and walk to the next classroom
As a drama student this is the best thing ever"
"1110","My school has a real lockdown and everyone inside my class was just eating red vines that the teacher had, talking, or playing in our phones."
"1111","My class is so stupid when it's a drill they are Soo freaking loud they laugh talk sometime even yell like what if it was a real lockdown I mean come almost in 7th grade and there so childish and the younger kids are quiet nice don't talk at all like...we need help"
"1112","*parking lot full of cars and every light is turned off* 
Shooter: Hmm probably there is no school today
Schools are so dumb thinking that shooters will go away because everything is turned off."
"1113","They did get it wrong because the students should never stay in one corner the shooter could kill them all."
"1114","One time we have had a REAL lockdown at school it was soooo scary we just everything dark and beracading the door and windows are closed everyone scared and terrified 😨 me curled up in a ball everyone at the back of the class quiet it lasted about 10 min. Idk o think it was 3rd or 4th grade id remember verry scary and spoopy and spooky"
"1115","Uhhh he was doing 130 and ""almost"" got a ticket?"
"1116","0:49"
"1117","I had a lockdown because the bank across the street was being robbed and the was in the school front yard"
"1118","Omg"
"1119","If i was in a shootinglockdown and theshooter SOMEHOW got in my classroom and he was reloading i would punch him then take his gun point the gun at him and say ""WHAT DO YOU FUCKING WANT ASSHOLE!? GET OUT"" then maybe shoot past him."
"1120","0:49"
"1121","I have a knife in a backpack I’ll kill them for sure or I’ll throw anything at them! Hehe"
"1122","0:49 xd"
"1123","We have already had s drill exactly like that, it was the same exact things and everything"
"1124","0:49"
"1125","We had a lock down for real for an hour because a guy threatened to shoot us and then we had anther real one because there was a bobcat"
"1126","They could out a trap door in front of the door as the first time and when they announce lock down when the teacher sees the door open the pull the lever and down the shooter or intruder goes."
"1127","3:46 how to stop a shooter"
"1128","00:49"
"1129","Bruh I would get scissors and say ""Drop the gun and get on the floor or its off with your dick bitch"" he would do that real quick
(Btw this is a joke -_-)"
"1130","0:49 lol"
"1131","Y'all won't catch me running down the street yelling I'm not dieing today NOT TODAY bitch at 40 mph to my house then comin back with a hot frying pan ready to smack the hell out of the shooter"
"1132","I only mass shoot on Roblox"
"1133","We need this at school"
"1134","0:49"
"1135","Ugh. I live in Colorado and I hate it when people keep bringing it up. And I live right by it!"
"1136","At my school there was never a shooting drill"
"1137","Shooter:*Walks in*
Me:*Grabs scicers and chair*AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Shooter:SHIT
Me:*kills him*
Shooter:AHHHHH
Me:*Laughs insanly and goes to jail*"
"1138","just give me a chair.that bitch be out."
"1139","land of freedom."
"1140","Oh shit, the lights are off and there are blinds, there must be no kids in that room"
"1141","After all the code red or lock down drills, I can confirm I have the best school. In science class, my teacher said that she would get the acid and give it to us in case the shooter or intruder bursts in, and in shop class (a class where you get to make plastic trinkets and carve wood) he said that we would hide in the lockers (we have tables with large compartments that can hide 3 people) or he would give us sharp wood knifes from the tool closet or power tools hooked to the ceiling in case if the intruder comes in."
"1142","So suppose someone is doing the tactics shown in this video during a real school shooting. “Disarming” The gunman, etc. If someone has a real gun, you do know that if they pull the trigger, it might hit the “defender” or stun them long enough for the shooter to get away? You’re planning your deaths, trying to look like you actually have a grip on things like this. Not having any deaths in these kinds of situations is impossible, at least in my opinion. However, it is almost impossible to get away with a crime like this as well. There are several witnesses and it would be impossible for someone to kill every person in a school like Columbine without the police coming at some point.  This is why most shooters kill themselves. It would take years to plan out a successful school shooting, and there is still a very high chance of the shooter getting caught either way. Also, god how fucking retarded can you be? Putting all of your students in a corner, giving them some fucking tennis balls and saying, “Okay kids, so when the shooter comes in the room, we’re all gonna throw these balls at him!” You should instead make them spread out along different places in the room, so some have the ability to run away when the shooter barges in. Don’t put them in front of the door. I can see why there are so many school shootings now, those students are like sitting ducks. If there are multiple shooters, what are you going to do then? There are so many flaws in your ‘defense plan’ that I honestly cannot comprehend why you’re even trying to give teachers and students the ability to defend themselves. It would end up even bloodier, if you look at it from a realistic standpoint."
"1143","They are so quiet."
"1144","At my school   when we do lock downs one kid laughs  in the corner"
"1145","This happened and I had a knife in my backpack and Saved my classes life, I Stabbed the man saying *DIE DIE DIE TRY TO HURT MY SCHOOL BURN!!!!!!*"
"1146","In my school we don't hide, they say if you hide you'll get killed so they ay to attack them all at once. Like with scissors, or a knife. Why is my school so weird?"
"1147","I have long nails and hard teeth I remember I bite my sister and she bleed 😬 was grounded for so long and well I don't cut my nails cuz I have been told stories like this and I kick very hard so all I'll do is sneak bite put my hands on the shooters eyes and SCRACH jk put attack"
"1148","I had a fake one too and in my school my classroom as a doors be my teacher saids if this real I will run out that blue door and I hope you come too and it was a fake they told us"
"1149","I think it's good but no real weapons or fake people dead with blood"
"1150","Me:""START SHOOTING THE TENNIS BALLS!!!!!!!"""
"1151","LOL THE BALLS FLYING XD"
"1152","We had a fucking helicopter parent actors and real life guns this ain't shit"
"1153","When they're talking about the Skyview school and the kid with a blue backpack and green skull on it came into the shot. I remembered I used to have that exact same skull on my kindergarten backpack"
"1154","These schools are gonna give kids polstramatic stress all for one thing"
"1155","Is this real? 😧😬"
"1156","Shooter:*opens up door* hello little children
My class:...
Shooter:I said hello little 
Children
My class:*starts throwing random stuff at the shooter*NIGGA BETTER GET DA FAQ OUT NOW
SHOOTER:*runs away*"
"1157","This happened today at my school we had to sit  behind my teachers desk for 1 hour someone in my class had a panic attack I'm still scared!! There was someone in the school next to mine with a bb gun and he/she didn't shoot anyone but all the schools in my community were on lockdown"
"1158","Awkward if a future school shooter watches these videos learning how to dodge every tactic..."
"1159","What if they practice too much and when/if a real shooting happens they don't really 'care' because they think it's a drill? 🤔 if you get what I mean?"
"1160","No one is hidden at all!!!🙄"
"1161","Wow! The teacher is awesome👍🏻❤️"
"1162","I have never been in one before 
But why not lock the door????"
"1163","at 5:53 wouldn't the shooter struggle a little be *more* than that?"
"1164","*w i t h  t h e  p u m p e d  u p  k i c k s*"
"1165","All the other kids with the pumped up kick better run faster than my bullet"
"1166","True story:

One normal day I was going down the staircase to my clarinet lesson, this lesson wasn't one on one it was with the other kids who played the same instrument as me. Lil old me walks down the stairs slowly not expecting anything.... half way through the lesson

**loud screeching sound**

Me: **thinks~fudge, that's the lockdown alarm!! Oooo sh-ts about to go down!!!!!!!! Wait... does this room even have a lock...?**

Also me: are we having a lockdown?

Only other girl in ya lesson: uh.... idk 😐 

Weird boy with brown nasty ass teeth: Ye bro, **talks with other boy sitting next to him**

At this point the teacher had locked the door and we were told to be quiet.... the room I was in had no windows so I was quite lucky to be in that room in terms of safety! Anyway, back to my story... What did we do? We carried on with our clarinet lesson! Smart decision! Once in a while we'd stop, listen then have a nice convo and share horror stories about school shootings because by this time we had heard loud bangs ( turns out it was the polices heavy metal shield thingy majigs ) everyone including the teachers thought that a person was shooting.... they were dum...

Lemme give you a little back story. My school is near a church, that lovely afternoon a man came in demanding that he should get confession. The loud bags, that was him slamming the chairs/benches. Not only was he doing that, he also screamed and yelled. The church phoned the school and they sent us into lock down to make sure the weird mentally ill guy didn't come in. The police came and whatever...

You may be asking, how did you get the story? Well, one of the girls in my grade/year has a mum that works in the school. Her mother works in a separate building, can you guess where it is? Right next to the church! She told her daughter and then her daughter told everyone in the school 😂. 

Now, if only I was back in my classroom because the lockdown was sooooo much more interesting there! I came back from my lesson as soon as the lockdown finished ( 2-3 hours ) and my friend in that class ran up to me and told me the story. Apparently, the teacher was on Insta the whole lockdown and didn't even lock their damn classroom f'ing doors!!!!! The kids couldn't do anything as they didn't have the keys so they just stacked their chairs and desks in front of the *TWO* doors! They were in the only classroom with *TWO* doors! Lucky them! 😂 
They sat freaking out with no corner to hide in. 😂 

So imagine this, I'm safe in the room that looks abandoned from the outside, the room used to be a storage room so it had a sign saying 'storage room' so thank Jesus for that! While my classmates, scared to death, crying with a door that wasn't even locked... while I'm like, partying. Just to make it worse, they couldn't ring/text their parents because we can't use electronics in class and had to leave them outside! In our bags that were hanging outside! The shooter could come in and know for a fact that everyone was still there because every students bag was hung outside their home room!😒 😤 😑

Ya so... dats the story... nothing rlly interesting and soz for the freaking narrative 😂 
I just had to get type the whole story...if you didn't like it and don't think it's real, well, that's your opinion... idc what it is and I rlly don't need to know if you don't believe me. You really don't need to leave a comment telling me I'm faking because at least I'll know I'm not!"
"1167","Closing the blinds and turning off the lights, probably doesn’t make the shooter think “hey the lights are off and blinds are closed, no ones at school” lol"
"1168","*school shooter comes in*
*shoots up, runs at the shooter 20MPH and tackles him to the ground*
*punches him in the balls and the pressure points*
SAVE YOURSELVES
*punch punch punch kick grabs a spoon and becomes the Ginosaji, beating him to death with a fricken SPOON*
*starts smacking him in the face and the balls with a spoon or something*
WOOOOOO"
"1169","6:35"
"1170","0:49"
"1171","Schools need more realistic drills, so it's not like they're looking like fools and learning complete bull crap."
"1172","Just for anyone who is scared for a lockdown, listen. You know those big ugly bricks that your school and classrooms are made of? There big and ugly and brick for a reason. Just want you to know that."
"1173","Ill grab a knife and a gun real and shotm the guy real or not"
"1174","I live in Michigan and our lock downs are hide where they can't see you grad something sharp/heavy and in fifth grade we would move the fifteen foot bookcase in front of the door...


I would say my lockdown is reasonable."
"1175","0:49"
"1176","0:42"
"1177","OMG THERES A GUY WITH A GUN LETS ALL THROW TENNIS BALLS AT HIM"
"1178","that teacher is awesome"
"1179","But didn't the shooters go to school so they know they would be in the corner"
"1180","Sitting ducks.  Should pick up chairs and barricade the door, set up an ambush by the door so if the sub human comes in, they got a fighting chance."
"1181","Tbh if you stay in a corner you more liking to die because they shooter can shoot everyone in the corner"
"1182","The longest lockdown drill we ever had was 30 minutes long."
"1183","THIS IS WHY U DONT TEXT DURING A LOCK DOWN... idiots
And btw, why aren't they barricading the doors... if they barricade the doors it will keep the person from coming in and would give police more time to get there... again, idiots"
"1184","""Please go behind my desk.""

Bitch why the fuck would I do that? You think the made in Taiwan desk is gonna save us? Catch me outrunning the cars so I can watch yall's dumb asses die on the news."
"1185","I feel like they should really make self defence classes or something (like what they did for the teachers) to students because it would really help in the situation"
"1186","i would hide behind the door then tackle the man like why would you hide at the teachers desk thats dumb as heck"
"1187","Whenever my school practises lockdown drills we always got to suck on lolipops so we wouldn't speak"
"1188","We did this in our school. If an actual person came in our room we get to through desks and scissors"
"1189","If I a shooter once was a little kid they were in school so they drills if everyone in the school has there lights off it's obvious there Someone in there"
"1190","Everyone throwing something would be extremely unsafe considering that one person could easily hit another student with a heavy object killing them. At 8:00 teachers legitimately ran into the shooter WHEN people we're STILL throwing things.  I would just say he'll na I'm out I would throw a chair out the window and jump out for the yolo trollos."
"1191","This is a everyday fucking reality in the US and it's scary"
"1192","3:28"
"1193","once we did that and dis girl starting crying when we came in 😂😂 her ne was alisha lol

"1197","Suaneliz Ramos lmao"
"1198","But it's also like the school shooters have probably been in a lockdown b4 like u think they don't know"
"1199","+I Love Camila Cuevas I'm pretty sure anyone can look and see something different when there are a huge mass of bodies in a corner. Also, they can either turn the lights on, or simply shoot at the students, because ONE of them at least is going to start moving."
"1200","We were told that everyone huddles in a corner, and the biggest kids go on the outside, so f they get shot they cover everyone else..."
"1201","Rhiro Yonve yeah"
"1202","Raquel Parra yeah and there are binders on the widows of doors"
"1203","I’m jk but this is funny"
"1204","Or you could not be a dumbass cause he can shoot you right away and listen to the teacher"
"1205","Hetalia Fan 

shitty joke"
"1206","I'm just out of word read the fucking comment he said ""btw this is a joke"" GOD"
"1207","You'd be sobbing out of fear for your life. Besides, how much damage would a blunt pair of scissors even cause against a gun."
"1208","Have you seen that one spongebob meme ""when you take down the school shooter but when everyones claping you pick up the gun"""
"1209","Uzzle the Puzzle If this would actually happen, they'd end up in prison for first degree murder, even if it was a murderer they killed. It's still murder lol"
"1210","XxCallie OctolingxX Shooter: *walks in*
You: *Grabs scissors and chair* HAAAAAAAAH
Shooter: *blows your head off*
That's what'd happen, man."
"1211","XxCallie OctolingxX lol"
"1212","Logan Windsor_RBLX you can but like maybe months or weeks"
"1213","Right"
"1214","Awkward for the fucker who wants to kill children."
"1215","Tazza m8 true"
"1216","I’d presume the teachers are told what day and time the drill will be, if they hear gunshots and screaming and we’re not expecting it I’m sure they’d know it’s real haha"
"1217","Tsuki Tsuki I feel you. so many kids pull the fire alarm at my school so many times that every time it goes off, literally nobody cares and they just keep doing their thing"
"1218","MbTheGreat I’m scared"
"1219","Mari Dv they do"
"1220","They lock the doors bec the vyber cant get in"
"1221","Mari Dv it’s called a LOCKdown. They do lock the door"
"1222","Alot of doors at schools have small windows in them or windows next to them and those coul easy be shot through"
"1223","Mari Dv haha my school DOSNT have winds in the middle of the door they have it at the top and are doors are big for some reason they are about 9-10 foot doors"
"1224","Ok I'm sorry lol I had to"
"1225","Yunwoo Kim my longest lockdown was like 2 hours in duck and cover because a kid found a gun behind a bush and teachers found a post on facebook that one kid is going to kill someone so they found the kid with the gun luckily it wasn't loaded so yea"
"1226","5 hours in total for me"
"1227","at my friends school it lasted 3 hours and they went home early because a student passed away"
"1228","mine was a hour"
"1229","MbTheGreat ya I know, sorry I’m on my YT Account 😂😂😂"
"1230","My writing teacher says to throw any paper we have at them, and she’ll tackle them because she watches a lot of football and has a football helmet"
"1231","It’s a way to slow down the shooter. In my math class, our teacher said “If you have a paper ball, throw it at the person and I’ll get them for you.” And I instantly think about throwing a paper ball at my enemy."
"1232","AllDaeEveryDae your comment broke my phone"
"1233","AllDaeEveryDae I'd do the same, exept, in a practice, I'd throw the ball from a distance and scream ""FUCK YOU, LEAVE THE FUCKIN SCHOOL!!!"""
"1234","I kind the want to try it lock down idk i just want lol"
"1235","what if they had a mini gun"
"1236","Lol people throw thousands of balls and teachers attack"
"1237","But if u just banned guns you wouldn't HAVE to do it."
"1238","Today we had a fire  drill so when the alarm went of I was like writing with my pen I just ren out like BAM !!

"1239","did anybody else thing this was cringe whn the teacher was fighting the fake gunman 😭😝😂"
"1240","If I had a real lockdown I would stand by the door and when the open it I would hit them with a chair and me and friends would attack and take the gun away"
"1241","0:49"
"1242","I want to join this drill and learn defense😂"
"1243","The one where they attack him? Amazing good job"
"1244","At my school you can’t text you friends and family that there is a lockdown because they will be worried and come to the school to pick them up and then..... dead 😂"
"1245","in my school we hide under our desks instead of huddling into a group in the corner"
"1246","The world is getting so bad now"
"1247","When there's a drill/real emergency, I would just throw the heaviest thing I've got and throw it at the person and say ""fuck you"" and then crush him with my fat ass."
"1248","What if it happens on the day of the drill"
"1249","I think listing kids to help is a great idea! But only if its appropriate like a football player"
"1250","In the UK were I live we don't have guns it is illegal"
"1251","Wtf this isn't hide and seek DONT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP THE LIGHTS ON BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DUMB."
"1252","I've been in a school shooting lockdown that lasted for 3 hours... scariest thing ever"

"1302","I don't know about the rest of you brits but at my secondary school we dont do lock downs."
"1303","Of course that some idiotic ass white kids in America are gonna grab their dads' guns and shoot up their schools. Other children and teenagers have to deal with REAL problems in their lives, not the 'my teacher was rude to me today so I'm gonna shoot everyone' crap. Not everyone gets to have an education and be raised by a loving family. Not everyone is born with everything they need to succeed. Some children would give anything just to be able to go to a school and learn something, no matter how insignifiant that information would be. Some children feel as if they have been blessed when they get to do something like eat dinner, it's an amazing thing for them to just have some food in front of them. Some children don't even have a family or a home, and strive to survive by begging for money and digging in the trash!! 
But then again, there are some motherf*cking children in America who take everything for granted and want to seem cool by bringing a gun to school. Because of people like that, America has to prepare its' students for SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. WTF? School shootings shouldn't even be a thing in the first place! You don't see that shit happen in other countries. We're prepared in caseof a fire, or in case of an earthquake. Most kids 'round here don't even know what a school shooting is! Kids around the world don't wake up one morning and say 'Hey, I'm in a pretty bad mood today. I think I'm gonna kill some people at school"", so why do American children have to?!"

"1305","I never realized how boring my school was. When there's a drill, my principal will just go around and try to open the doors.



Edit: OMG WHY AM I GETTING NOTICED BY THESE STRANGERS?!?"

So, basically Im on the volleybalk team and comes around the first game of the season we traveled to another school and we were practicing for 5 mins before the game and practiced for 5 mins with a shared court. As we are sharing the court there are parents and students on the bleachers we all of a sudden go into a lockdown and we are all freaking out because there are doors behing my team for part of the school and doors behind the other team and people are in the bleachers, the gym is hige and you can easily see into it. My team is on one side and the opposing team is on the other. We are all lying on the floor and all of us a freaking out. There was an actual lockdown during the game. At least thats what we figured everyone was trying to think it was fake but no. My district is in a pretty chill area but this school goes into a lockdown. Why? There was a man inside the school who had escaped from a mental institution in the city and made it to this town and all you here is gun shots (and the police were shooting) this is a day that i would never forget and we went on with our game. Like nothing happened. And we were worried but nobody was shot. The man was arrested/put back in the institution and scary thing is, is that he was right next to the gym"

"1386","We had a practice drill a few weeks ago and I was in advanced science class. We were seriously unconcerned. Everyone took their worksheet and a pencil to the back of the room and continued to finish the paper. There's probably something wrong with us."

"1389","Oh god, there are 5.5 million people who know what to do, how am I gonna shoot up my school now?"
"1390","This is what my class would do. We would lock both doors (my class has two doors just in case), close the blinds. Thankfully teacher has my class mates phones, she can give it to them obviously for safety. Me and my friends would either be crying,screaming, talking or being silent. We take important things and calm the fudge down. If not, we will get tables and chairs for the doors and safety. My schools classroom has fire alarm so we basically run out and line up then lock my school. Staff will call our parents too. Honestly, if this happens hopefully EVERYONE will be safe. Anyways I'm good at cutting so I can cut the guys penis off. Or stab them. I'd probably laugh out of nowhere."
"1391","My school drills are just to go under  desk and put our bags over us"

Well my question even now 11 almost 12 years out of school if of it was a fellow classmate they would know Latin classes are canceled for the day ment. As we didn't have Latin classes. I remember lockdown drills had them twice a year. Then bomb threat drills twice a year. Though the drills for bomb threats ended up being real usually it seemed."

and i freaking lock the doors

atleast our school has a brain"
"1421","In biology class we get all the tables and block the door with tables. If the intruder gets in we through all sorts of chemicals at the intruder making his life hell. If all fails the closest biggest students help attack the intruder with the teacher and the others run. It’s better for most to survive then all to die.. in photography my teacher also said that. He said that if the intruder gets in he will tackle the intruder and so will the rest of the kids near by, then we all run for the excit door in class"

"1437","Why do people hide in corners? That's one way to assure your own death. You could easily rush one of the back exits and escape. If not you, someone could. The sooner someone leaves, the sooner help can arrive. If you teach everyone to sit and hide in the active zone of a shooting, the more likely they're to get killed and the less of a chance of police arriving."

How about getting rid of the whole public indoctrination slave/worker bee creating system and educating a different way. Maybe teaching morality and spiritual principles again.

I was literally holding a huge guitar case on top of my book bag and no body questioned me. After ten minutes they literally send us back in saying if we saw anything suspicious then we should contact them... that day I did not feel safe at all"

"1476","Is it ok to kill a school shooter?"
"1477","I had idk 2 lockbdowns."
"1478","In all seriousness, and to be completely honest, there's a really big difference between the 220 pound guy ""resisting a bit"" and a real life terrorist trying to kill you.  Irl, you will be shot.  I kinda understand why they r putting them through the ""active shooter scenario"", cuz thats how they train you in the military (big age jump here). They scream at you and train you to act calmly under heavy and loud shit happening around you.  In order to show these kids what its really like to experience and prepare for a real event (god forbid), they need to be put through a staff-scheduled harmless event with a ""real shooter"" coming into the school and talking over the intercom or something and honestly IK this will scar them but if u want them prepared you need them to experience first hand the mental thoughts and panic of reality.  
In a real event, its full blown panic, obviously not scheduled, and its terrible that people may die.  A room of 15 kids (ages ~5-9) and a teacher can't stop a terrorist from shooting.  If someone tries to disarm they will be harmed in the process. There's no best way to really ""drill"" a terrorist coming in the room, which is why I'm most definitely jumping out a window and running."
"1479","We were having a drill in the computer lab (not in the corner like a idiot) we walked to the little room looked all doors and went into the storage room inside the little room and did the usual,turned off the lights and shut up
But what was weird is since my friend is scared of the dark and I'm not she thinks I'm her shield from the dark so when the teacher turned of the lights it went pitch black and she literally grabbed my arms and wrapped them around her as she cuddled up in front of me 

I wanted so bad to say ""get of me dirty bitch"" but we had to say silent so I just used my ""skills"" and slowly moved my arm of her back and scooted over to the person next to me"
"1480","""All the doors are locked.. Welp, gonna just leave now i guess"""
"1481","Last year my school had 5-7th graders and I was in a room next to a room with 5th graders and we had a code black and my class ran out of the building quietly because we understood what a school shooting was and the 5th graders didn't seem to because they RAN OUT OF THE SCHOOL ALL SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS"

Anyways I was in the flute classroom with me we were 7 students and a teacher so in my school they use ""code blue"" and we have to go to the ground and cover our neck with our hands there is also ""code green"" that we have to make a line and move to a safe area"

"1592","Holy shit, good thing these people never lived in my town. Cops had guns all the time (and this is in a state where it's illegal to open carry). Side note, if you're a parent and your kid's school has an intruder, don't race to the school. You're just gonna make the cop's jobs harder. 

(Also, that drill with the colorful balls was funny. Our drills were never that fun. It was just hide, shut up, and wonder if it was the annual tradition of an actual shooting threat.)"
"1593","We had a real lockdown almost every year at my school."
"1594","i had a drill when i was 15 and i kept shouting ""WHAT WILL HAPPEN? FIND OUT IN THE NEXT EPISODE BACK TO YOU IN THE STUDIO MARY (my bestie)"" my teacher thought it would be funny to put my in her car OUTSIDE in the PARKING LOT that was apparently where the 'shooter' was i heard mary shouting ""LOOKS LIKE GRACE HAS BEEN SENT OUTSIDE WILL SHE DIE WHO KNOWS BUT WERE SURE WE WILL BE SAFE FOR LIFE LETS GO CHECK OUT HOW GRACE IS DOING"" (not completely sure couldn't hear her that much) she got sent to me and we couldn't stop laughing we got suspended for 3 weeks though 🤣😂🤣"

"1603","My science teacher has a whole bunch of rocks and hammers in his room."
"1604","I feel like when your in a real lockdown. You should hide, but also try and grab something that'll most likely hurt the shooter. Like a book. A chair, maybe even stab them with a pencil! Just SOMETHING to keep you alive."
"1605","If I were practicing to attack I would bite him and if it's a boy I'd kick him in the nuts oh and my class had a practice lock down and the teacher said if a person ever did get in our room start throwing chairs and desks"
"1606","The other day my school had a soft  lock down and last year my friend and me saw a guy and he asked us to let him In my friend ran to a teacher and we had to have a soft lock down"
"1607","I don't understand why (what I've seen, American) schools don't have high security around them. We've always had fences and security guards 24/7. It's strange to me that doors are open and anyone can move in and out at will"
"1608","Dam what if that shooter was frikin John Wick"
"1609","Lol my teacher told us if a shooter comes in just throw desks at him😂😂😂"
"1610","I got a super realistic drill once. My classmates sat in the corner crying where I was sitting by the door to jump the shooter and choke hold him. And when that asswipe came in and I followed my plan I got suspended for violence you could've told us it was a drill earlier"
"1611","im my school we all get under our desks instead of huddling in the corner, but nobody shuts the fuck up so it's completely useless"
"1612","My husband almost got a ticket ...."
"1613","We need separate rooms for the dumb asses who laugh and think its a joke and actual smart people who can keep quiet. I've been in a real lockdown and I cannot express how irritating it was to be half scared and listen to the other students laugh like its a game"
"1614","Did the teachers not teach their students how to react in a real one or fake? We have to turn our phones off and not use them cause in a real thing if they try contacting their parents it overloads the cell tower and makes it harder for emergency contact to and from the school plus we barricade, lock, tie hinges, and STAND against the wall and stuff. AND WE LIVE IN A FREAKING CITY THAT NOT A LOT OF THAT STUFF HAPPENS TO US YET WE GO FULL OUT. Even during drills. We also have the option of running too depending on where your classroom is."
"1615","I think our school needs something like this. We had a bomb threat at our school and pretty much nobody, including the staff, had no idea what to do. We have our lock down drills but our students don't take it seriously."

"1627","What if they don't have a pistol🤔"
"1628","This is what my school needs because when I have a lockdown drill all the kids in my class keep talking,and laughing."
"1629","If they did that even if it was a joke my ma gonna sue my school"
"1630","Ooohhh my teacher said like a lot of years ago, why she started teaching, they had the lockdowns with people pretending to be injured and stuff and people would have to carry them on those cot things and yeah I guess it was cool then but they don't do it anymore and it's sad"
"1631","why would you try to teach people a shoulder throw? not everybody there is the heaviest person or the strongest i can think of many easier things that are just as effective"
"1632","This is amazing training"
"1633","i'm in highschool yet the kids in lockdown drills in my classes don't shut up. my class would be the first ones dead smh"
"1634","I'm in middle school and personally I would die trying to save others than just sit there waiting for someone who kills people to leave, and it's crazy. So thank you for putting this video up on YouTube it helps a lot. 🙂"
"1635","3:48 *LOL SHOOTER GETS REKT*"
"1636","i always wondered why someone thought locking everyone in the classroom, in a corner would be effective. especially if the shooters a kid. even if it is an adult, surely they've been through an intruder drill before and know that the class hides in the rooms"
"1637","Nice"
"1638","It's actually better if they are scared so they're more motivated to listen and be quiet"
"1639","Now many schools are using a new system that is focused on getting out of the school"
"1640","Yeah throw tennis balls at a man with a loaded ak-47! That'll stop him!"
"1641","Hm the teacher would be dead in Seconds that wasnt a fighting back"
"1642","Hahahahaha watching this as european is funny "

SHUT THE FUCK UP DO U WANT TO DIE?!?!?"
"1655","If they keep doing this the kids will get use to it but when their is a real shooter they will not know...."
"1656","My dad said if there's a drill. Jump off the window at all cost...and run to our home."
"1657","In 4th Grade I had a school which had a field with Baseball and Soccer, on the edges of the field was pure large forest. In the half year of the semester we were put on a code orange. (2nd highest Lockdown.) Because a homeless man wandered onto the fields with a golf club, and arrows. It was pretty wierd... and later in the year my friend and I found some golf balls, a dead mouse, and half of a arrow including the sharp part. This isn't a joke, really the truth. Nothing else has happened since then hah. Besides an average Lockdown."
"1658","my school has these. Its really not that scary, if anything its a break from school 😂"
"1659","My classroom door has a rectangular window and the fucking glass is missing so now there's just a rectangular hole in the door. There's also the fact that our school has five floors and my class is on the fifth floor"
"1660","Wtf hide in a corner i would just jump out the window and say fuck this"
"1661","If I was a Kid in there I would of thrown my chair or book at him"
"1662","Yeah, and he was scared too. The dude in the brown shirt was scared too. I was scared too."
"1663","You have to make sure the kids aren't on their phone and are quiet. If kids call or text their parents they put the parent in danger."
"1664","You wouldn't be like this everyone would just panic and run, like a fire"
"1665","The school shooter goes to the school that they shoot up so they'd know the drill too well and plan for that"
"1666","When you live in a country where this actually has to be practised you know somethings wrong"
"1667","If I was dat guy killing peeps I would've said *A L A H U A K B A R"
"1668","Yes, let's hide in the corner and hope the shooter won't notice us."
"1669","Just randy orton rko him!"
"1670","Yall kidding me? I wish this happened in Colorado, honestly we huddle in the corner. Some kids are lucky to have teachers ready to risk their lives and have plans for the kids. In my old middle school,  my communications teacher(who was out in the pods, or modules, like movable extra classrooms) would tell us to grab the fire extinguisher, a pencil sharpener, tablets, desks, chairs, etc, and sprint to the neighborhood. In my other classes, they would hush us. My fifth grade teacher told us to sit still and not speak a word. And OBEY THE SHOOTERS. Hell no, I'm breaking a window and getting the hell out of here."
"1671","In my school, they're announced to parents, but not students. It's made clear that it is a drill when we're notified over the loudspeaker. They tell us what the shooter looks like, what they're wearing, and their location. Depending on where we are, we should either evacuate immediately, or lockdown. Evacuation is fast and silent, and lockdowns are like the one shown in this video, only we have to hold textbooks, binders, etc. if the shooter ever entered the room. We're taught to throw anything that we can at the shooter and aim for the crotch if they're a man, then once they're hopefully down we swarm them and kick away the weapon (not allowed to touch it under any circumstances). We cannot leave the classroom if we are locked down until the police/principal unlocks the door."
"1672","GOD DANGET MAKE SCHOOLS A SECRET AREA NOT JUST IN THE OPEN"
"1673","If the guy doesn't have his gun in reach and is clear for an attack i'd kick him in the balls but if it were a fellow female.... Grab her by the hair and throw her maybe. Idk... But idk when i'd do that skin"
"1674","I'm in high functioning and even when we do practice drills everybody is loud usually if we ever have to do a real one then we are all gonna die"
"1675","If a real school shooter can to my school why wouldn't people use like scissors and stab the shooter or charge at him, tackling him."
"1676","I think it's a good idea. How many lives can be saved if when a shooter goes into a classroom, and instead of being picked off one by one? We were ready to fight back, sure we could die or het hurt, but 30 kids and a teacher against a guy and a gun dad result in 15 deaths and a dead shooter, but if we don't do anything hundreds may die. I'm not trying to make light of anyone dying, and I don't know if I would be able to do it (I would like to think I could), but fighting back can change the setting drastically. I mean, I'm a freshman in highschool, I wish my school would do something like this so I could be prepared for the worst. I don't want to be a sitting duck if there was ever a shooter. Sure i may die fighting back, but at least it gives me a chance, and it sure does give everybody else a chance."
"1677","This would all be unnecessary if there was a law that only allows sane people to buy guns"
"1678","I played as a dead student c:"
"1679","My old teacher used to tell us to grab something as a weapon to use"
"1680","This is morally wrong. This is teaching kids not to be afraid of a shooter. Drills are good but not like this. When push comes to shove this could harm the children by making them try to be a hero and think nothing can go wrong cause it never did in the drills."
"1681","Honestly if I was in this situation first I would be shating my pants and second I would say goodbye to everyone then I would stand by the door and wait for them to come and just punch kick bite freaking as much as I could to stop him even throw a desk at them probably get shot but I want to die as a hero knowing that maybe I saved a few people's life (Edit if I lived and I knocked him out I would first probably shoot him and then Be pumped with adrenalin and run through the corrodors YOLO and then probably kick ass or end up dead)"
"1682","our school didnt tell us about the drill so when the person came in i with my friends were ready to throw dictionaries dusters and we broke his hand unfortunately"
"1683","Slowest fucking teacher training ever"
"1684","Internal Screeching 
This person is right. They didn't say that it was a drill, they said that they were going on lockdown and the news reporter was the one who said the shooting drill thing."
"1685","Not Neo They didn't specify if it was practice or not, so yeah, they should be terrified"
"1686","Trisha Marie Tabuena Imagine if they do this sort of hardcore drill without warning and then bust the doors open whilst your class is talking."
"1687","2 years ago my class had a lockdown because we were having a party and there were 4 men with guns outside the school. My school is really small so it was a bit easy to get in our classroom. They didn't get in, but I cried so much that day, i thought it was the last moment I'd be alive😢😭😭😭😭"

"1693","I don't know how huddling up in a corner helps the kids but and I don't know how beating up the bad guy shooting I don't know how that's gonna work because what happens if the kids just got really hurt"
"1694","Am I the only one who laughs during a lock down"
"1695","No, they need to do this. This need to make it seem real, so when it actually is a real one, they will know what needs to happen. All schools need to do this."
"1696","waht a joke !!!!!!!!!"

OMG LOL WE ARE SO DEAD"
"1698","We had to go in a lock down because there was a fight going on outside of my school and it involved guns"
"1699","At my old school they would tell us that there was a drill like a real one while we were walking threw the hallways so we had to hide in closets and janitor closets while there was a man shooting with a fake gun so i ran to a closet and some other kids were hiding in the same one so we we're talking about how happy we are that we're missing our french test for a drill even tho we didn't know it was fake"
"1700","see, in my school, there are fights literally every month and these kids don't play. We talked about procedures last year and we all agreed on  squaring up and grabbing scissors and desks lmao don't fucking hide in a damn corner"
"1701","I always wondered why not add a secret trap door leading to another safety building where the killers won't know anything about."
"1702","Our school has an actual police officer on campus at all times that has a gun and a taser. He swears to never uses the gun on the students only if it's a real intruder."
"1703","I hate lockdown"
"1704","I remember in Kinder in lock down we hide under any tables like the back table our desk or maybe the teachers desk we hide so the shooter or the invader would think we were already gone but then again the person would just look under the tables XD"
"1705","I have been in a soft lockdown for a stabbing at my school. I learned little psychology that day."
"1706","Meanwhile in Britain...




Lockdown drill, once a year (maximum)
Steps:
• lock door
• draw curtains
• sit in chair silently...
They say this is incase something dangerous comes on our grounds like, and I quote, a *""dangerous dog""*


Yeah... I'm screwed when this happens. This is why I'm taking tips from elsewhere."
"1707","We put our desks in front of us (they are bulletproof)"
"1708","Wow this is same like tom clancy rainbow six siege"
"1709","Why do they go in a corner, it's just making the shooters jobs easy"
"1710","3:48 wtf balls"
"1711","America has got to the point where they have to do drills for shooters for their kids. Horrible. I think this would be enough to think about a firearm reform..."
"1712","Bitch why the hell are they teaching them to hide behind a desk They need to grab books and desks and starting throwing it at whoever the person is"
"1713","One time I had a school lock down and everyone started panicking and we all hid under our tables, with the lights and door locked( we had tables not our own desks) Our teacher even started crying that's when we knew it wasn't a drill. Then, some guy started running down the halls, hitting lockers trying to open doors. I almost shit myself I was that afraid. But, most the time I was laughing with my friend trying to make the whole situation alright :/"
"1714","What's with the corners? I don't understand. That's just putting prey together and giving them a bigger target to hit. Are you kidding me?"
"1715","Gathering in one place is the worst idea in the world during a school shooting! Sure , survival in numbers , BUT THATS WITH ANIMALS! A WOLF PACK WOULD ONLY NEED ONE BODY TO FEED OFF OF FROM EACH HUNT! A PERSON TRYING TO SHOOT EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL WOULDNT KILL ONE PERSON! SO SPREAD OUT! DIVIDE AND CONQUER! PLAN AN AMBUSH  SUCH AS : stand behind two doors in a doorway so when the guy walks in you can attack from behind , then disarm him and apprehend him!
NOT GATHER IN A SINGLE SPOT ! XD"
"1716","1:24 ""my husband almost got a ticket coming ...""...so that's where the major concern lies.ok ok🤔🤔😖"
"1717","0:51"
"1718","Are school teaches us to get on the floor and put our hands on are heads. Smart. ONE TEACHER Told us to through chairs."
"1719","I think it's funny how they are quite and not talking but me and my friends during the drill are like ""Allu Akbar"""
"1720","Huddling is the stupidest thing to do

Who would do that. It increases your chance of death and the shooter gets to hit a collateral"
"1721","*In third grade we were excited for having a lockdown drill since we only have one like once every 2 years and the teacher just locked the door, turned off the lights,and told us to shut up and continue working.She even left the damn window open.* 😑 Teacher of the century everybody. Nah jk she got fired for not even telling us to hide in a corner even though that would do nothing."
"1722","My school does that stupid ass corner shit. Mmm no fuck you. I'm out."
"1723","I used to remember in 4th grade we had an extended time 6am-8pm because we have to practice,then that night I was going to pee,then I heard someone screamibg anfbanging in the
 door,I told my teacher there was someone in the bathroom they used the mic and they said lock all rooms this is not a drill lock all rooms and we hid and they checked the bathroom there was someone's blanket"
"1724","I punched a kid during a real lockdown (due to criminal investigation) he kept talking outloud and everyone told him to stop and I just had enough so a punched him and kept quiet"
"1725","This is honestly my worst nightmare.. Someone plz give me advice"
"1726","At my school we barricade the doors are they stupid"
"1727","our schools lock the doors with metal bars. Sadly, they've forgotten to put any of these bars on the bathroom doors, so people are still victims if they were in the bathroom"
"1728","I really think it kind of matters if there scared but you need to know what these kids will do, you can't get mad for doing this even though it could scare children. You don't know but it saves these kids"
"1729","He's on live pd"
"1730","We do a drill but it's not this extreme"
"1731","If a shooter was in my school I'll just get my ass out of the school of beat  the shit of he shooter with the desk"
"1732","The fact that this is necessary is appalling. Not only that, but why the hell would you bunch all of the kids in one corner? That just makes it easier to shoot them."
"1733","someone started an instagram livestream during my school's drill"
"1734","I wish every school would teach us how to throw people to the ground xD in a real drill tho, would any of them really do it? They would be scared out of their mind, soooo"
"1735","Hey guys welcome back to another videos of whats inside today where checking out whats inside a school shooting"
"1736","oh.."
"1737","how to save your self from a shooter

step 1:grab a pencil and a pencil sharpener

step 2:sharpen the pencil till it's really sharp

step3:hide and wait for the shooter to go past you

step4:at the right moment stab the shooter with the pencil

like if this worked and i am not begging i just want to see for how many people it worked"
"1738","They tell kids not to bring knives or guns to school,so just throw tennis balls at him,yea,that'll work"
"1739","In real life if you had to attack you should go for the eyes, head, neck, and weapon."
"1740","no talking silent"
"1741","i'm weak, they threw plastic balls"
"1742","if we're in gym class a d we're lucky, we can hide in the closet with the sports junk. y'know, with all the baseball bats, tools, etc. yeah, my school allows us to attack, hide, or run to the nearby church. my plan is to run home, though"
"1743","fuck you all if there was a school shooter at my school I wouldn't sit in a corner I would run behind the door or something and pray to god he only goes in for like a second, or else I would ruin the glass windows and fucking run away, y'all can stay in that corner I don't give a shit."
"1744","Get the fat child to lay on him"
"1745","like the idea but in a real school shooter the teachers is either going to shit themselves or the shooter will be a loot stronger then a teacher and he will rekem"
"1746","Wait I don't know I subbed to u lmao"
"1747","im always scared this would happen and i fart suoer loud😂😐🤔😒"
"1748","Why the fuck would you do this? You're terrifying everyone"
"1749","I aint gonna hide at the corner or under the desk im going next to the door with my fucking pencil and stab their god damn fucking balls,get the fucking gun, and then get *suspended*"
"1750","If I was ever in a situation like this I'm just looking straight for the exit. I'm opening the window and running faster than Bolt, just running straight as far away from that school. Luckily my school is right across a fire station."
"1751","0:57 was she having an orgasm or something?"
"1752","its funny how this guys have drills for shooters while my country doesn't need this because all the schools have aggressive kids XD"
"1753","Guy resisting? If it was irl he would of just knocked the girl out"
"1754","I'm glad we don't have these in uk"
"1755","This video could be teaching potential school shooters where and how everyone is and is going to react?"
"1756","It's crazy to think that school's in america actually have drills like these because school shootings might actually happen? If you have to hold drills like these there's something really fucking wrong with your country"
"1757","There just throwing little balls at someone with bullet proof clothing"
"1758","Why is America so fucked up"
"1759","How I feel like playing in payday"
"1760","I always used to get nervous while we had drills, and when i was in 2nd grade, i cried because i was confused."
"1761","My classmates are assholes, they screamed during the lockdown






But since I graduated i missed them anyways"
"1762","My mom was apart of a school shooting. She was in about 7th grade I think at the time. A kid came in and shot the Spanish teacher (I think) because he was failing. But the thing is that there was a sub on the day and she was a parent to two little kids and she died. When the kids that were in her room evacuated they had to step over her dead body. The kid also shot the principal but luckily he's okay and still alive. Luckily no one else got hurt except for the shooter who I think is still in prison."
"1763","Use nerf guns"
"1764","What I would do is block the door with desk and chairs so no one can enter"
"1765","If there was windows i would break them and make a run for it"
"1766","Won't killers know where the kids are hiding? They're literally all grouped up on a corner. I'm pretty sure they'd know that the kids are still in the room.."
"1767","We were practicing a lock down drill and this stupid 6th grader dropped a book, on purpose, and we all would have been dead."
"1768","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks"
"1769","all the time people assume that the shooter is a man when they dont even know, it could be a woman"
"1770","One time, my school had a lockdown because someone wandered into the school, and me and my classmates thought this person was a shooter. This is what happened:

Classmates: *screaming for their lives*
Person: Guys, if the guy finds us, we'll be stupid!
Me: You idiot, we won't be stupid because we'll all be fucking dead!
"
"1771","Jodi don is my spirit animal"

*Shows clip of students giggling under the desk during the lockdown*"
"1773","school is bringing"
"1774","4:20 there not gonna point the gun at the wall"
"1775","The announcement is a bad idea. What if the shooter hears and he knows that students are in there?"
"1776","Well this looks fun"
"1777","lol why would they do this"
"1778","Heres my plan evryone grab a fucking desk and try and make the school shooter mashed potatoes"
"1779","Only in America... just ban guns. PROBLEM SOLVED!!!"
"1780","But what if the shooter enters the classroom?

GRAB THE SCISSORS AND WEAPONIZABLE OBJETS, CUZ WE GO CLUBBING"
"1781","I think that during any of these drills they should always barricade the door and get SOMETHING to fight with. Because WHEN he gets in everyone is just a sitting duck behind a desk it's so retarded it's the dumbest drill they need to do it better. Like at the end when they threw tennis balls and jumped on him THATS WHAT THE DRILL NEEDS TO BE LIKE!!"
"1782","This is schooling in the USA ? So silly. At least have all the windows open for kids to escape."
"1783","School shooter sees video know exactly what to do."
"1784","All The Other Kids With The Pumped Up Kicks..."
"1785","What a great idea. Lets all huddle together in a pile in the corner of a classroom. We wouldn't wanna make it too hard for the shooter, right? I mean, its not like they could open the windows and get out potentially saving hundreds of children, right?"
"1786","How about introduce gun control?! Then you wouldn't need these drills. Americans who don't believe in gun control are dumb AF."
"1787","We had a school shooter and he came into my class I threw my bag at him with all my books in it. It was a practice and I got suspended because I broke the guys nose."
"1788","One time on Halloween our bus drivers played a cruel sick joke on us they got a chainsaw (without the chains) grabbed our teacher dragged her outside and made it look like she was killed. They got fired"

"1790","""Pretend there actually is one"" what if the person comes late?"
"1791","Ok ok ok ok ok but what if it was a lmg,ar,or a sniper well a sniper is a scope gun"
"1792","Ah, America... 
Where Kinder Surprise is banned, but guns aren't."
"1793","Newt TimesTen I know my ways in my school"
"1794","Jason you're not so much hiding as you are barricading yourself in a room, a shooter will go for easier targets like a crowd of people stuck trying to get through a small exit door"
"1795","It’s dumb to hide in the classroom the school shooter obviously knows where everyone is fucking hiding just run through the fucking emergency exit"
"1796","I don't think anyone would respect the rules or make the school more safer if people were allowed to bring guns/knives to school."
"1797","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS YA BETTER RUN BETTER RUN OUTRUN MEH GUN!1!1!!"

"1802","Don't actually try this if there are multiple shooters or unless you have able bodied students that can throw a fast, accurate, and solid punch."
"1803","You don't know whether there if there's more school shooters outside, making sure no one gets out."
"1804","Ed Denoy The ladders would make it easier for school shooters to access  the children. Escaping is kinda loud, especially with a grand horde of children."
"1805","That is a tough choice.Maybe they could could have some window escape ladders in a closet."
"1806","Ed Denoy at our school, that wouldn't be possible because anyone jumpimg from the 2nd or 3rd floor windows would be landing on solid concrete"
"1807","Right?"
"1808","i think there should be gun control, but you should still be able to get something small like a low power rifle and a glock. You don't need an M16 or M60 or stuff like that."
"1809","They are the most vacuous people on earth. Religious, gun nuts."
"1810","I’m just not going to respond to this crap"
"1811","You're joking right?"
"1812","The people who would have the guns and keep them anonymously would be thw bad guys, then nobody would have a form of self defense"
"1813","na-chan IKR"
"1814","Even if you ban guns criminals will still find a way to get them."
"1815","na-chan ok so America bans kinder eggs but not guns, Canada doesn't ban either, but here in england kinder eggs aren't banned but guns are a lot stricter lol"

"1823","Ball thing that the students threw was actually kinda cool! Except , When its really real , THROW THE HEAVIEST!"
"1824","This is why I wanna be homeschooled..."
"1825","If my school ever goes into lockdown I'm not going to fucking chill in a crowded corner with like 20 other people.. I'm going to grab a fucking fire hydrant and bash that over the shooters fucking head as soon as he/she walks through the door."
"1826","In 3rd grade we didn't have a door. Just the only and huge hallway and the hige computerlab and library infront of us."
"1827","if there was a real school shooter at my school i would get in one of the cabinets instead of the damn corner lmao"
"1828","what do you do if your in the café lmao we never have drills when we're there"
"1829","i actually been in a lock down"
"1830","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run faster than my gun"
"1831","My teacher told us if we ever go into lockdown we should grab our English textbook and hide under her desk. If anyone walks in throw all of our big heavy textbooks on him and hope we break something lol"

"1833","I have an easy solution, GRAB YO KNIFE AND STAB THE HELL OUT OF THEM"
"1834","SCHOOL SHOOTING IS GREAAT"

"1836","Have people by the door to knock them out."
"1837","I live in Colorado and dang lock down drills are scary"
"1838","we never do stuff like this in my country... this is sad"
"1839","I remember doing a lock down drill (5th grade) and it was a practice and everyone kept squeaking their shoes and I was thinking in my head 'were gonna die because of you'"
"1840","For everyone asking why they all huddle in a corner, I think it's because they want the shooter to see no students and think no ones in there but maybe I'm wrong"
"1841","Just make it harder for people to get guns. This shit doesn't happen in Europe."
"1842","In my social studies room I'm gonna be the first to die or escape cause I'm next to the door .-."
"1843","Theres like 1000 kids vs 1 dude, drop that bitch"
"1844","One of the teachers at my school keeps a bat in her room"
"1845","What?? The chance of a shooting happening at your school is so incredibly tiny, and most schools where there was a shooting, they didn’t have these trainings. Do you really want to scare the hell out of these kids?? This really is one of the most ridiculous things ever."
"1846","Just get rid of guns you muppets"
"1847","Danish schools have no worries regarding shooters"

"1850","When the shooter has a gopro, you know it's for real"
"1851","is it funny i found the fighting part funny?😂😂 i know i have issues. there alll cheering LOL ""go go tammy go!!"""
"1852","if this happend id run home i live close to school"
"1853","N-word touch my game we gone turn this shit to columbine"
"1854","During these damn drills they should do this give the teacher shotgun give all the kids knives"
"1855","the longest lock down i've had was 40 minutes cause it was real lol"
"1856","I would of thought it was a good idea for the police to come in armed and participate in a drill. Helping the kids learn what to do."
"1857","Columbine and 9/11 happened drills will be a thing for long time to come just like fire drill everywhere. Tornado drills in Midwest. Hurricane drills where they get hurricane. Earthquake drills out west. But having guns being shot is to far. Also I am going to site fault with this having all kids behind teachers desk is in one spot is bad idea. They should spread out and hide in the room."
"1858","One step:
Stay home kids!"
"1859","We did this in our school and some kid jumped out the window and broke his leg"
"1860","Just give each kid a weapon so they can defend themselve"

They had the nerve to threaten to ban me from waking at my graduation until my father who is a lawyer showed up 🤣🤣"
"1868","The teachers are hot"
"1869","Dang this is scarier than when our schools go on lockdown for an hour."
"1870","Wow, I'm in 7th grade at Jewett today and I never knew about this."
"1871","At my school, the teachers have a baseball bat in a cabinet by the door so if a shooter would happen to come in, the teachers have a weapon. Also, we all barricade the door with desks and chairs."

"1898","man those kids were ugly,"
"1899","The teachers at my school say if we have a lockdown while we're outside, then we have to run into the forest next to it.

"1914","0:46 I'm just here for the free tobacco."
"1915","This may horrify children when they practice this. But it's better then them not knowing what to do in this situation! They should be prepared! Not just be waiting for the teacher to tell them what to do! They should know what to do! Practicing this drill is a very important thing to do! Children need to be ready to fight! To hide! Or to keep safe in an emergency like this!"

"1952","One time during a drill it took 2 hours And I flipped out"
"1953","They should be able to lock the classroom doors, our school has huge locks and has door stoppers with locks.  They should not be able to open that door, or that shooter will shoot them all"
"1954","They need to do that at my school, maybe not with real guns but volunteers banging on the doors and acting like it's real cus our practice lock downs aren't taken serious. Kids laugh and joke around during it teachers put a red check mark on a paper on the door to let the principals know one kid is out of the class or a green check mark to let them know everyone is in there, witch isn't right. (In my opinion)
One time when I was in 8th grade a dude broke out of jail and was near our school with a gun and it happened right when school was getting let out. They told us to stay inside one student found out about the guy with the gun and everyone went running back to there classes, in my class we had got as many desks as possible and made a small walk to protect us if the guy game in or anything, and the only guy in our class was ready to attack the guy with the gun if he got in our class. 
They caught the guy 2 blocks away from our school. 
These drills really need to be taken seriously."

they should make these more realistic by telling the kids its a drill AFTER everything"

"1964","I'm always scared if this would happen and I was in the bathroom. So if you're ever scared I'd suggest using the teachers bathroom, (if you have one). The teacher's bathroom is for one person, so it has a door and no stalls along with a lock. So guys, honestly. Use the teachers bathroom."
"1965","Damn Charise! Them cigarettes got you fuuuucked up."
"1966","There was a news caster who was killed in my area and the entire school was on lockdown because the shooter was on the run but hat day I was getting my braces. I was terrified for my friends...."

"1968","School shooter drills are just focused on shooters that have an IQ lower than a fucking pop-tart"
"1969","This is why i bring shivs"
"1970","A teenager with what looked like a real gun (it was later found out a BB gun) went on our elementary schools property one day and since my and other teachers thought it was just a drill, we did not do anything about it. But my mom is also a teacher at that school, and she was the only one that noticed that the intruder announcement did not say ""this is just a drill"" so she was scared out of her mind and was the only teacher in the entire school that followed all of the lockdown procedures. All of the other teachers gave her a mad and jealous look the next day because she also got an award from the police department."

"1972","""INNOCENT"" Kids"
"1973","Imma be honest, she kinda hot.








I'm not a pervert though, just saying..."
"1974","this is why principals need to make an anocment because the kids thinks it real"
"1975","No idea how I would react, this sort of thing doesn't really happen in the uk so we don't do drills, but that might just be because we have more security on our schools"
"1976","Have retired veterans with guns standing guard at schools. There are thousands of retired veterans who need the money and would love to protect children."
"1977","The problem is with the drills is they teach kids to huddle in a corner. But you should be texting your parents and finding a way to escape, without getting seen by the shooter. Which normally classrooms have a second to door to get out side in case of a fire. And also it's easier to kill them all in one go if they are all huddled up with no escape. Like seriously are school dumb."
"1978","Imagine some dude with a trenchcoat comes before the drill"
"1979","There was a Robber near my school but my 2 bffs and I went home early I was so afraid for my other friends"

"1986","Whers is overwatch?"
"1987","2:45 ""Five minutes is I think the most we've ever had."" HAH.

A few years ago my math teacher was in a REAL situation that lasted 4 hours. The police were looking for someone who has robbed a store not far from the school with a gun. They were afraid the guy was gonna come into the school and kill people."
"1988","My Schools so stupid because everytime we have a lockdown, we go outside"
"1989","I was in one in 2015 I was so scared"
"1990","just use the retarted kids as a shield"
"1991","Our school teaches us to hide in the room all together and lock the doors. Not grab weapons or anything. If we are huddled then the shooter can kill more of us easily and quicker. They need to teach kids to evaluate the situation and see what is best. If it is one shooter you can easily take them down with a class of 30. Grab the top of their gun they can only fire onece. This is what they need to teach us. But they teach us to hide and make it easier for the shooter. If a shooting was at my school I wouldent hide in the room I would either 1. Get the fuck outta there if they aren't outside 
2. Find a weapon and prepare myself to fight them and surprise them."
"1992","i've had a lockdown for 3 hours before"
"1993","""Let's make police officers come in with real weapons and traumatize the children....cause that won't have any consequences...."""
"1994","One time a shooting happend and then I was at the bathroom with like two kids my age and one k1 student and the gun men went in the bath room and I saw him come in and then I told the kid to be quite and me and the other girl were just praying for dear life he came in he put a grande in the bathroom and the Grande rolled under my stall and at that point I was like I'm so dead the I grab it and threw it out the window but little did I know it was fake but the gun men was real it's just that the Grande was fake then I got out the bathroom with the girl and the kid and I said I'm going to fight him and so all I did was kick him in the balls the he fell the I grabbed the gun and stared punching him the the other girl did to the kid was screaming for dear life then I pointed the gun at him the kid ran upstairs and told every thing was ok and to go down stairs and call 911 and the all the kids were like wtf what are u doing and I said the reanson y we had the drill was because of him the the teacher was like CLARIZA PUT THE GUN DOWN and I said we'll do u want to die alright then then the copes came and took the mand and I gave them the gun then I asked if I could tase him they said no but I did it anyways so that's my shooting"
"1995","if you're gonna grab the shooters arm, in the second you have before dragging them down you should always try and get rid of the guns clip so that the shooter only has a possible one shot (the shot that might be in the chamber) at you or others surrounding you."
"1996","No they didn't get it wrong our drills are taken as a joke by kids in my class"
"1997","Honestly if I had a school lockdown like that I would be terrified even if I knew it was real. I am hate the noise of a gun firing"
"1998","If there was a school lockdown my whole school would freaking die because they would be 1. Screaming and crying 2. Laughing and talking and 3. Arguing and fighting"

"2000","130 mph I'm pretty sure she is lying cause he definitely would've gotten a ticket."
"2001","Bru it's a drill btw didn't watch vid yet"
"2002","If that was real I'll throw the whole school at his ugly fucking future and life he will regret every moment of his fucking life"
"2003","If there was a real school shooting I wouldn't huddle in a corner I would pull out my knife and hide behind the classroom door so when the shooter walks in I stab him,and save other kids lives."
"2004","I was rooting for that lady fighting that man I was like Yasss"
"2005","Honestly how do school lock downs even work. They see all the books and empty classes. Plus to they did it to so I mean your fucked. Also how there's a video teaching what kids do now."
"2006","those kids are dumbasses for thinking a police is gonna kill them"
"2007","If the shooter comes in a classroom at my school one of the teachers have bats.....So were good ^^"
"2008","once, there was a real lockdown in our school. Instead of doing the classic procedure, me and another student stood next to the door. When the shooter came in, the other student nutkicked him, so he was disabled for a few seconds. Next, I slammed his face so hard he fell unconscious. Then we disarmed him and removed any objects that could harm other people and then locked him in a locker until the police came. When they arrived, the shooter was hardly conscious. it ended so well that I got the gun ( empty and unloaded of course ) and his helmet as a gift to how brave I was. The other student got the riot and police badge also cuz he also did a big part of the job to take down the shooter. it was all great and we also got free donuts from the police."
"2009","The only time anyone in my class was scared about a lockdown was when it was a level 3 and the teacher wasn't there (he was part time high school and part time middle school. We were his first class he had in the middle school), and they didn't say ""drill"" like they normally would. We hid in the corner but couldn't lock the door, so some of us started talking about what we were going to do if someone came in with a gun. ""One or two of us could hide behind the door. If someone with a gun comes in, we can hit them with the chair"" ""You'd probably die"" ""better one than all"" ""what if there's more than one?"" etc. 
The lock down ended and we laughed or acted like nothing happened. It's kinda sad how we only took it seriously because we had no way of knowing whether it was someone nearby, or if we just didn't hear the word drill because as soon as the announcement started, we were freaking out, or if someone was actually inside and we could die.

"2135","That drill would trigger a Fucking Anxiety Attack. Bad fucking idea"
"2136","School shooter: oh, the lights are off they must be gone I'll come back tommorrow

"2147","One day in third grade my class was sent in from recess early because there was a tiger that had escaped a nearby zoo"
"2148","When I was in the 6th grade (I'm in the 9th grade now) my elementary school had a shooting drill by surprise. It was a very realistic drill like this one here. We had no warning at all and my friends and I even asked if it was a drill or if it was real life and we got no answer. My friends were all texting their parents and I told them no I'm pretty sure it's okay but they encouraged me to text my mom at least so I did. With my luck my aunt was a teacher at the school (sarcasm) and my mom texted her. As soon I I sent my mom that text the teacher yelled ""ITS JUST A DRILL THERE IS NO NEED TO TEXT YOUR PARENTS"" so long story short I got in trouble for texting my mom even tho everyone else was🙄😂and it's all that teachers fault because she wouldn't tell us if it was drill (btw she got fired)😂😂😂"
"2149","places I'm scared to be in while a shooting is happening

the bathroom
the cafeteria 
in the hallway behind the shooter
in a dead end hallway 
locked alone in a classroom
in the courtyard alone unable to go through the doors because I'll get trapped again."
"2150","This is just giving kids bad ideas."
"2151","Plot twist: A school shooter shoots a school shooter during school shooting"
"2152","what the how did you...."
"2153","At my school our drill is turn off the lights and sit in the corner, and usually we just play on our phones 😂 but alot of kids and teachers bring knives and guns (in their truck) to school and we've never had a school shooting and our school was built in 1913"
"2154","In my opinion, lockdown drill? Great idea! Kids need to know what to expect in these situations and to know what to do. Unannounced lockdown drill where no one but higher administration (principal, vice principal, etc.) knows about it? Bad idea. We had an unannounced lockdown drill (as in teachers and students did not know about it last school year and I was so afraid after that drill that I didn't go to school for 2 days afterwards because thinking about it nearly threw me into a panic attack (for reference I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and experience panic/anxiety attacks often). It was the middle of passing period when the alarm went off and I was too far away from my next class to get there in time, so I ducked into the nearest classroom. This happened to be the room of a teacher who is a war veteran. 
So of course, she doesn't know what's going on, we don't know if it's real or not, she's yelling at us to get down and be quiet, panicking, telling kids to get in closets and hide there because there wasn't enough room in the corner for everyone. I was freaking out because that was the very first unannounced drill they had ever done and they never have a drill without at least telling teachers about it. So for the teacher to not know what's going on made me think it was an actual code red lockdown and someone was in the school with a gun.
About 10 minutes (or what felt like it) go by and someone comes over the intercom and lets everyone know it's a drill and it will be over shortly. The drill ends, I go to class (it was thankfully my last class of the day) and I was shaking and extremely anxious the rest of the day. It was awful. And, like I said, I didn't go to school for the next 2 days because I was too freaked out.
So to conclude, lockdown drills are great, but at least let the teachers know so that if anyone gets thrown into a panic attack they can be reassured that it's just a drill and they're not, ya know, in potential danger of being shot at."
"2155","Question: For kids like me who have a fear of loud noises or kids who are Autistic, would we be able to be excused from this particular exercise and submitted to a more mild one or would we have to participate as well? Because my school allows me to leave before a fire drill (then again, I'm a high-schooler who knows what to do during a fire, tornado, and lockdown)"

"2157","AlexTheYoutuber117 dat happened to my sister"
"2158","IdK why they hide"
"2159","K Tuttle exactly!!!!!!!"
"2160","Also What if the shooter knows the drill? He could just blow the door turn on the lights and BOAM even if you hiding there is chance of him finding you better thing is fighting back or run away in emergency exit in the class room ( if it's in 2nd floor or more then use window as exit"""
"2161","K Tuttle maybe they turn the lights off, lock the door and put down the shade when they leave? I’m not in the USA and we don’t have these kind of drills but every teacher puts the shade on their room and locks the door whenever they leave the classroom. If they did this, they might spent ages trying to get into a classroom with nobody in it and therefore they would kill less people as it would have waisted time. They don’t know what’s really empty and what’s full but I don’t get guns where I live but I hope this helps you?"
"2162","K Tuttle bruh, they school shooters know that the cops are coming. They're gonna go to classrooms where they can clearly see victims"
"2163","Turning the lights of doesn't make a difference in some classes; it's day there's still light"
"2164","It's probably a surveillance camera."
"2165","she’s probably recording because she thought it wasn’t a drill, and the school would need proof to the police if they tried to get the shooter in jail so"

"2190","So I was once in a lock down, it wasn't a drill. I was so damn scared. I was crying with my friends and worried because I didn't know where my brother was in the school. We were all thinking that there was someone on campus trying to kill us. The lock down later for 45 minutes. We were huddled in a closet crying our eyes out. When it was over, we were informed that a mentally ill man had shot up a store nearby our school and he was looking for places to hide from the police. When the police found him, he was hiding in a bush right outside the school."

Have more? just reply. Plus you don't have to like."
"2193","This seems so fun I'd wish they will that training at my school"
"2194","Instead of this... how about have the teacher have a concealed carry license and beng able to shoot the person about to shoot the children? OH WAIT those gun free signs prevent anyone from having a gun! In all seriousness, the sign prevents law abiding citizens from having guns, not criminals.

"2249","At my sisters school there was a bear cub outside the school. So they called the school into lockdown. But they didn't tell the kids what was happening. So, all the kids thought there was a shooter. They were in lockdown for 45 MINUTES. There wasn't even a threat as long as they stayed inside. Imagine being in there. I can't believe they let that happen"

"2256","If there was a lock down we would probably die first.BECAUSE THE WINDOWS DON'T HAVE BLINDS
we would just duck for safety.
Once there was a lock down because a pit bull was let into our school and stuff
And the was another lock down where a man came into our school and kidnapped 2 kids"
"2257","What kind of school is is???? Their drills are so intense that they have some guy who looks like a total idiot run around shooting a fake gun? I know it's a sensitive topic but if I were a student their I'd be laughing my ass off... Also, why are the drills unannounced? That's a great way to cause legal, outside problems, including worried citizens and police officers. Not to mention to scare the shit out of the students."
"2258","See kids? This is why I skipped school, I knew all the hidden escape routes.





(Of course I was a straight A student so I could afford to lol)"
"2259","I've actually experienced 3-4 real lock down. It wasn't a school shooting or anything close to that, but they lock us down whenever there is a threat that could escalate. In 3rd grade, I believe a man that the police was looking for was spotted on the street in front of the school. We ended up sitting there for an hour and there was a fucking helicopter flying around outside."
"2260","Every time I go in a lock down (nobody says it's a drill) I get stuck with the people who would be loud and won't take it seriously. At least my room would be the most quietest room after 8 minutes"
"2261","this is actually smart"
"2262","Yeah because the big dude with the gun can't put her in a choke hold with his other big arm and knock her out."
"2263","It wasn't a school shooting, but my friend was playing in a dumpster on the last day of school and cut his leg, we had a lockdown, and the ambulance came, I was the only student crying."

"2267","the plan is retarded clos se the wodden door and group up in a corner.If there was a real shooter he could easily shoot the doors open and get easy kills on a group of kids"
"2268","In high school JROTC. We always had designated door hiders. People that hid behind the doors. So when they are opened. They jump out and start stabbing the person with anything they got. We would practice it and it was crazy. People won't mess with our colonel."
"2269","My school almost got in one  but the guy got caught"
"2270","My problem with drills is that the kids will do like 20 of them and then when an actual shooting happens they'll b like ""It's just another drill, chill out guys"""
"2271","Omg the guy's got a gun! Quick, everyone grab your ping pong balls!"
"2272","*I never understood the security in these exercises. EVERYBODY knows what the students do.. Turn the lights off, put the desk in front of the door, hide.

Even so there's kids, you can do the same as the teachers, no? Ugh, sorry. It's just so stupid that innocents are getting killed because of that technic. It's my opinion btw, don't fight too much in the comments ^^' (I know you'll do it anyways)*"

"2279","Bitches man Bitches"
"2280","I honestly hate how they always try to dehumanize school shooters as if they're just bastards who want to kill innocent people for no reason. Half the time it's because the other students had to be assholes to people and, as a result, got fucking shot. I don't agree with it, but that's how it is."
"2281","Imagine a school shooter opening a door to an elementary school class or something, and then immediately gets pelted with pencils, staplers, scissors, chairs, etc., and then gets fucking taken down by a bunch of 7 year olds pouncing on them."

"2291","Uts better than my high school a few years back. They said ""Washington is in the building"". My teacher had no idea what the hell they were talking about. Our door remained opened, the teens remained loud and cheerful, I decided to ditch class with a friend and happily roamed the hallway.... needless to say we spent the morning after in a ""town hall meeting"" about how shitty we did 😂😂😂."
"2292","OMF"
"2293","abac yolo HAHAH😂 you're right😂😂😂😂"
"2294","Can't the teacher's have alot of shelves with doors that can lock on the inside for the kids to fit and hide in instead of hiding by a ducking desk and the school shooter can easily find them?"

that would make life soo simpler and safer"

"2326","They did this in my school but I didn’t know it was fake because my ass was washing my hands in the bathroom and I saw people with guns and I ran out the bathroom and ran straight to the exit and my mother picked me up and then they suspended my ass for running away"
"2327","So I was apart of a school shooting drill for community service and I had to pretend to be having an asthma attack so the paramedics picked me up and put me in an ambulance."

"2330","Story time:
Be my class
Thirteen and fourteen year old seventh graders
Kids don't know how to keep their heads together and shut up
Have a lockdown drill
Half of the class in the computer lab with no teacher
Everyone there runs into classroom, which is right next to computer lab
Realizes two things:
1. We could have just stayed in the computer lab and nothing would happen
2. I could hear the principal telling everyone to be quiet, since those people were running into the classroom loudly 
Everyone in classroom now
Two minutes pass, and everyone is whispering loudly
And then this happened:
A kid (who has azerburgers {don't know how to spell it}) tells our teacher (who I think may have anger issues) he has to use the bathroom
Teacher says no
Ohgodherewego.mp4
Kid gets annoyed and looks like he's about to have a panic attack
Literally starts to scream
Everyone in class is laughing
Teacher is ready to punch someone (not really but u get the idea)
Drill ends
Principal brings class in computer lab
At the time eighth graders already graduated 
Is annoyed by us
Ifeelubro.png
Then kid who had to poop has argument with principal about how he had to use the bathroom very bad
Ends up losing
Keeps arguing about it after principal is gone
We keep telling him we would be goners if he did that during an actual shooting or etc.
Guesswhathedoesntevengiveacrap.omg

I realize we would all be dead because of everyone in that classroom except for me
Lesson here is that I should have just jumped out the window, saved myself, confront shooter, awesometakedown.png, save school, be famous, etc.

The End"

"2334","tf this is my school damn I'm shocked my principle is fucked up then 😱😱😱😱"
"2335","oh so now its a shooter not terrorist"
"2336","My 5th grade class had 5 girls (one moved away) so the 4 of us just hide in the bathroom and block the door with stuff"
"2337","Shooter enters
TACKLE THE, AND TROW TENNIS BALLS"
"2338","Why dont americans see that his is something unbelievably unusual that is not done in proably every other first world country. How can apparently most of the americans not see that these things are directly related to their gun laws. Or should I say ""to their missing gun laws"""
"2339","we're taught to throw our desks and chairs and do anything we can to bring down an active shooter if he comes to a classroom"
"2340","Why do they hide in the corner directly in front of the door"
"2341","Only in America boys"
"2342","nigga blasting the place up and yall just sit behind a fuckin desk grouped up, what type of no russian shit is this. fuckin run, jump out the window id rather take that risk then wait for the terminator to come in fuck the place up. tf you think he gonna just pass by like some npc"
"2343","damn school shooters learning how to shoot it up"
"2344","good luck..!!!"
"2345","School's in my state never conduct such drills, most of the times not even fire drills."
"2346","We had a drill at school, but since my teacher thought history class was SOOO important we just kept working on our work"
"2347","Close the door isn't gonna help even if they are locked. If they guns they could just blow open the door. Hiding ain't gonna do shit but the schools would shoot you first if you tried to escape, if they did this drill of locking down the room I'm gone. I'll go out the window if I have to"
"2348","hide in the classroom. smart. thats gonna stop them. maybe have security gaurds with long rifles."
"2349","I would appeal the speeding ticket if i got one in that situation."
"2350","In fifth grade there was a really long lock down and it was pretty scary. It lasted a few hours and some classrooms even made their own makeshift toilets o-o  I can't imagine schools having a drill like that with an actor going around with a fake gun and yelling. I feel like talking about different situations and learning how to run, hide, or take action is most important. If you're going to teach kids by scaring them, you're doing more harm than good"
"2351","american news: drama, panic make evryone scared. the end"
"2352","But if they do drills so often they won't panic when it's real because they will think it's a drill"
"2353","get a frying pan as Rapunzel did. done"
"2354","""This time the gunman is resisting""... Yeah right, in reality the gunman would have picked her up, while she was trying to lock his arm, dropped her on her face and break her neck..."
"2355","Back im my day we just had tornado drills. Which wasnt even long ago, goes to show that people have gone fucking crazy."
"2356","My school had fire drills and school shooter drills. But in my old school the alarms would be loud classical music so the shooters don't expect anything."
"2357","Yes, yes...the best tactic. Have them kiddies hide in the corner and have a old teacher pounce on a possibly trained killer who knows how to deflect such attack. Making it even less effective then a attack in Pokemon"
"2358","If I ever got a text from my hypothetical son/daughter saying that they were in grave danger, but it turned out to be a drill, I am throwing the principle of that school through a wall, regardless of what (shitty) apology they give me. Who thought this was a good idea? This could cause major trauma. I'm a bit of an emotional person, and if this ever happened to me as a kid I would have probably died from heart failure."
"2359","Only in merica!"
"2360","Kind of fucking sad gun violence has gotten so bad these cops have to show up at school and explain to young kids why they could be targets I mean when I was young I didn't know what a gun was until I was 10 I like guns don't get me wrong it's just sad that crazy mother fuckers want to use them for purposes there not meant to be used for"
"2361","I think it bull shit just sit and hide"
"2362","Yeah stay in a corner"

"2365","Yeah schools
TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS AND CLOSE THE DOOR AND HIDE THE STUDENTS IN PLAIN SIGHT
THAT WILL STOP THE INTRUDER





EVEN THO THEY HAD DRILLS LIKE THAT IN SCHOOL"
"2366","swouldnt the person trying to shoot the school hear the principle say the lockdown stuff??"
"2367","But what if the shooter shot through the door? The kids would scream, and then that's it. That's what always scared me about school shooters. My class would be dead in an instant."
"2368","Living in Canada, all they do is jiggle the doorknob .."
"2369","Yeah like hiding in the corner with all the lights off is gonna save your life. They're fuckin sitting ducks! My school does this dumb shit too..."
"2370","I had this one teacher where his classroom was located next to the roof so his plan was to barricade the door and break the window so that we could get onto the roof. It's a good thought but the windows in that school were way thick and being stuck on the roof without a ladder isn't too smart"
"2371","I got shot once... only it wasn't fake....... and it nearly fucking killed me. God was with me on October 27th. All you hunters, let this be a lesson. ALWAYS BE S.M.A.R.T. Safe, make sure, always check, respect the firearm and trigger safety. If you don't see your target don't shoot. it might be a hunter. It might be me. And you might have a .50 caliber."
"2372","OK at least ONE kid laughed because he was a dank and thought this was funny xD"
"2373","By the way DO NOT HUDDLE INTO A CORNER WHILE IN ANY LIVE SHOOTER SITUATIONS THIS IS FALSE INFORMATION. In short if there is a shooter incident there is likely going to be fully automatic guns involved and in some cases explosives. If you are in a corner you are dead if you are under attack you are dead. Don't hide run if you can't run hide in a small space with a maximum of 3 people IF YOU NEED TO SMASH A WINDOW AND JUMP OUT DO IT.  Throwing balls won't help getting a fire extinguisher having all of the kids not in the immediate line of sight and having the strongest person there stand next to the door and attack him from the side get others to hold him down and take his gun when you have it search him he could have a suicide vest on and if you have his gun hold him at gun point point blank at the head and if he tries to get another gun or a detonator SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD your life is more important than a shooters oh and also after a shooter is apprehend take his weapon and peek around the corner if you don't hear police there and there is someone with a gun USE YOUR NEW TOY"

"2376","I live in Colorado to and once it took 15 to 20 minutes"
"2377","my school does this but we do not duck and cover. We block the doors but in a real situation, they tell us to assess when we should run or fight."
"2378","Genius. Keep the target in a locked building. Instead of having emergency ladders by all second story+ windows to LEAVE the building and leave the attacker walking around an empty building with locked doors that he thinks his targets are behind. Then the swat can come in and not worry as much about civilians"
"2379","6:08 *WWE SCHOOL SHOOTING*"
"2380","If i had a school shooter and i'm close i'm running underneath the bleachers"
"2381","Its retarded when they dont surprise the kids.Its not like if a robber comes and says : IM GONNA ROB YOU PREPARE,HIDE OR RUN FAST.
Fucking dumb.Thats how you drill,you surprise them instead of warning them.Otherwise its no prepare,its a game."
"2382","She's worried about the ticket not the fact he could have crashed and died instantly 😁😁"

"2385","man the man could punch put greater danger"
"2386","If this happened to me I would hit them with a chair then grab his gun then start shooting them but then I'll be the one going to prison instead of them"
"2387","they are assessing the situation incorrectly, they should be making the school buildings safer, not kids ready for combat."
"2388","wtf if I was in science I would fucking throw acid or the bunsen burner at them"
"2389","America...we need to talk. 
One shooting a month?
Get your shit together"
"2390","why would you do a fake school shooting without telling the parents and use real guns"
"2391","Just kick him in the balls"
"2392","There's no way this actually happens? Why the heck would you actually do these drills. It's likely going to scar kids. This is simply unacceptable. There are far better ways to deal with teaching kids to prepare"
"2393","Now i want a shooting to happen at my school"
"2394","They need to use their math books."
"2395","Why not every classroom has a M4A1, so when is an active shooter coming, the trained teacher pulls out the gun and fights back with the shooter?"
"2396","Ok







We don't have these in England."
"2397","3:38 non stop giggling like a five year old"
"2398","when we have drills
we hear the siren (the bomb siren is what we use AND ITS SO LOUD YOU CAN HEAR IT FROM MILES AWAY) and we hide under tables or go into small rooms that are attached to the classroom. and we just sit there for like 30 minutes and tbh I think we should actually do something better because all we do is sit away from the door, but we could be sitting near a window."
"2399","Incoming *I live in another country lol US is so dumb* comments"
"2400","Incoming *guns are so bad I'm never even safe* comments"
"2401","I've never done this.. because I'm in England 😎🖕🏻"
"2402","With the methods of lockdowns in schools today it seems like they WANT students to die.
Curling up in a corner makes all of them such easy targets and having them all just run for the exit at once will just alert the shooter to their location. I think the schools need to rethink their lockdown plans."
"2403","If I was in a school shooting I would charge the shooter down"
"2404","This is a very bad idea. Subjecting a person, especially before the brain is fully developed, to a situation like this can leave irreversible psychological damage. And if said person has a mental illness like anxiety disorder, it's almost certain they'll never recover. Not only will this trauma harm the persons quality of life. It's likely that they will perform WORSE if the shooting actually happens. Because if they develop PTSD, GAD or similiar their fight or flight system will not activate properly in the case of a real shooting. They'd then be much more likely to fall to the floor and hyperventilate than they'd be to actually attempt to escape the threat."
"2405","Move to England the lot of you. You shouldn't be teaching children how to stay safe and alive, you should be making the schools safe."
"2406","Why is the reporter so sceptical of the drills? Id rather have some practice runs if im going to have to hide/fight for my life"
"2407","Try preventing the cause of the problem rather than a symptom"
"2408","Why would they have kids just sit in a corner? just makes it easier for the shooter... they should run and get out and away from the school..."
"2409","Ummmm that's not how we do active school shooter drills we do the run hide and fight never stay in the classroom unless you have too and never gather up in the corner all together that's a recipe for a massacre."
"2410","well im happy that i sont live in america in my country there has been only 1 school shooting and there a student killed a tezcher but thats about it."
"2411","of course it was tampa"
"2412","5 minute drills??? Wtf
At my school we sometimes go for a full hour"
"2413","My teacher told us that we can throw anything we want at the intruder. Well my gym has bowling pins sooooooooooooo..."

"2425","Maybe but if they ran out away from the school their could be more shooters out their.."
"2426","My school sits in the back of the classroom. If this happens to me I'm going to the person last because people that are in the front aren't as safe as the person in the back."

Find your nearest exit."

"2435","If there's someone in the school with guns threatening to kill the students and staff why *the fuck* would you all go in the same *fucking* corner?! That's such a dumb thing to do and will kill more people than it will save! In a classroom, there's metal chairs, heavy ass books and other shit you could hit the attacker with! If I'm in a classroom and there's a fucking guy with a weapon threatening to hurt/kill us, there is *NO* way in hell I'm stay in a fucking corner and ""hiding"". You're putting my life and other kids life on the line. I will take the nearest thing I can throw and the attacker and throw it."

"2437","You're so stupid now a killer nose what lockdown are"
"2438","Unannounced drills r prolly the best"
"2439","Their training against one target what if there are five gunmen they will blow the brains of the teacher attacking the first guy also it teaches gunmen to watch out for the teachers so that they will be ready to kill teachers who think the training will help when it teaches them to get SHOT"

"2441","keep memeing"
"2442","Instead of scaring the shit out of students here's an idea. Ban guns stupid US government."
"2443","Oh no how can we stop kids from being scared of mentally ill people who had a way too easy access to guns? Why we should give the teachers guns too! Guns for everybody! A teacher might be close to a burn out and blame kids for her pain after her breaking point and she has was given a gun? Then we give STUDENTS guns too!

Maybe we should just have made it harder for those type of people to have guns in the first place? No, no, no, this is America."
"2444","I have not done this drill I only have done fire drills. Plus my school has so alam for end of start of lunch to  snack time or end of school.  plus our we have no gates and lots of windows "

"2446","Holly gets a columbine flashback and rips of the guys arm"
"2447","How to deal eith a shooter"
"2448","You would rather the kids to not be scared than be alive???  This is why school shootings in America happen. Because they take things concering guns too lightly there. An extra step , being overprotective , is ALWAYS better than a dead kid. 

This is why Germany is such a successful country with low crime. Because the law there is hella strict."
"2449","I watched a how to escape terrorist attack bid and now I'm going to have paranoia at scoll and grab something to throw in a lock down drill."
"2450","That training for teachers has no use. It's nice to know the techniques, but in a real fight the gunman would do anything to get loose: Hitting, stomping, biting and everything you can think of. Knowing the techniques is not going to help you"

"2469","Don't We All Want To Die?"
"2470","To everybody who's saying ""school shooter - 'no lights? must mean they're not here!' "" are blind. The shooters know that they're hiding. When they enter the building, the police are automatically notified and are on the way. A shooter isn't going to invest all their time trying to open one door to a classroom and then be arrested. They tend to roam the halls to kill who they find first."

"2475","When the teachers tried to atta k the person coming in they were uncoordinated and they were getting in each others way. I'm not saying that it is possible to think very clearly sometimes but they need to at least have some sort of plan."

"2477","I went to the bathroom and the school was about to actually get shot up.
A student had a pistol. I don't know what type,but I walked towards the portables.(where my class is.) I saw him standing at my portable and I speed walked to the other building.
I went to a classroom and stood next to the door in the other building,since I got locked out.
Found out that the gun was fully loaded the next day and that he could of Shot me,if I got noticed by him."
"2478","It's funny how they tell teachers to cover the window. Using this information, if a school shooter was trying to find rooms with individuals, they could use these blinds as indicators that children are in the particular room."

"2501","I know a solution. Ban all firearms you fucking stupid Americans"
"2502","We honestly don t have this drills(at least that i know) because im not in America but what would I do if shooter comes to my school:
1.If im on first floor i would just get trough window and ran as fast as posible because if i stay there long enough shooter will just bust in and maybe even shot us to death
2.If im on higher floor i would barricade door with heavy objects and hold and wait because if shooter tries to break door too heard he may brake arm or leg or it would be painful and if he try with just some power it wouldn t effect barricades
3.If i can t barricade and can t run hiding would be option but idk that would work because simply classroom doesn t really have good hiding spots so he would see us easily
4.If i need to fight him i would trie to hide in good position(i said it not good to hide but this is just for few seconds) and grab him from back if posible and grab his neck,why?It simple because he would be caught off by suprise and he doesn t have time to think what to do and we could bring him to the ground at least in theory.

And that what would i do in that situacion at least"

You are risking some ones life if they come."
"2508","There was a legit lockdown at my high school, someone got stabbed. NO ONE stays hidden in a classroom, that's the dumbest shit ever. You're just waiting to get hurt by the criminal.

"2511","my elementary school was only one story and there are these secret tunnels under the school with an entrance to it in each room, but we never used them and the only way I know about them is because I noticed the hidden latch and looked into a crack and saw the tunnels. hopefully that school will never have to use it"
"2512","As a kid at school who does the duck behind your desk as a drill for a shooter I know I'm not going to follow that or I'm going to die first I'm going to grab a fire extinguisher and pull the alarm break the window and jump out"

"2541","That feeling when you live in a country where there was no school shooting in its history and you are looking at this like ""whaaaaaaaaat?"". People should atleast do a psychiatrist test before getting a gun. That shit is fucked up."
"2542","why are there active shooters at education buildings at first place. what's the cause ?"
"2543","I see people saying its bad and emotional trauma. it is training for if It actually happened"
"2544","my school says that if a school shooter comes into the room we just have to sit their and not fight back"
"2545","""wow a shade to protect us from a shooter"" *BITCH GRAB SOME SCISSORS AND GET NEAR THE FUCKING DOOR*"
"2546","but apparently if the gun is any bigger than a glock they're basically dead"
"2547","Why the fuck were the kids hiding in groups? What the fuck that's the most shittest plan ever!"
"2548","what if they have lmgs and in full body armour? ithink i just kiss my life goodbye at that point"
"2549","Isnt the way they hide kind of unsafe? all of them sit near each other in one side of the room
If the shooter had an automatic gun they could all be dead in a second"
"2550","if a shooter came into my home ec class a bitch gonna be stabbed"
"2551","Schools should be doing this if it prepares kids for this then yes"
"2552","Why dose the Repoters voice sound like Donald Trump? xD"
"2553","we also have drills"
"2554","Question
If everyone does this drill
Wouldn't this help the shooters locate students?"
"2555","Omg, here in Mexico we have earthquake drills, and nor the parents nor us, not even the teachers, know that there going to be a drill."
"2556","how is throwing balls gonna avoid you from getting shot by a double barrel?"
"2557","It's funny how they all practice this but I'm like






Fuck this shit I'm out"
"2558","This is why i stab everything"
"2559","Its so diffrent in  SA TX lol"
"2560","its not ""rehearsing for death"" its preparing everyone so that when shit goes down, there wont be any death."
"2561","School shooter watches this: Oh, no wonder the school I went to last time seemed so empty"
"2562","If only Australian school drills were like this."
"2563","Oh no! school shooter! Trow some weak ass tennis balls!!!!"
"2564","Wow this generation of kids are pussys.."
"2565","Being huddled in a corner is probably one of the worst things to do because if a shooter breaks into the class everyone is literally sitting ducks. The best possible thing to do is barricade the door and be as spread out as possible, maybe outing desks horizontal to act as cover and using anything you can find as a weapon if the worst happens."
"2566","My gym class was instructed to hide in the girls locker room in the event of a shooter. the teacher said ""this room doesn't lock, there's only one door, and there's no weapons. instead of coming here, leave through one of the 8 exits of the gym and run to the woods."""
"2567","So people are just traumatizing kids? Wow"
"2568","Whenever we have a drill no one takes it seriously we just sit down and go on our phones"
"2569","The code red alarms went off at the hospital 😓 I was so scared!!"
"2570","If your classroom has no back up door or windows you cant break the window or open that door and book it down the road. You just have to huddle your ass in a corner and wait."
"2571","You see, if it was my school, 80% of the students would be on their phone during the drill. It's boring af"
"2572","*_At my old school our door was half glass and we didn't have a cover for it, And another time I was in the bathroom and loud ass girls screaming over the announcement so I didn't know what happened so I washed my hands and ran out to see the hallways quiet so I'm like ""Next store teacher is probably out taking her kids to a special"" so I'm walking to my classroom to see every light off then I knocked on the door I'm like ""Yeah no one will come to the door and open it"" so I just hear footsteps coming my way so I'm just straight up getting in position to punch the person coming my way and no duh it was a cop and I almost punched her in the face but after that was all over pretty much everyone rushed to me and said what happened and since I knew one of the girls voice I said ""Chole and someone else was talking over the announcements so I didn't know what was going on"" so yeah, At recess I confronted Chole and was cussing the life out of her because if that was a real lockdown then I would be dead and pretty much her friends took her side and since I had only 2 friends they stuck up for me and a bunch of other people that I didn't even know or talk to and a person I that hated me and I hated back surprisingly stuck up for me so I hated them a little less but yeah.. Sorry about the long ass story_*"
"2573","We need this is our school we don't even have school lock down drills we only have fire alarm drills and one time my teacher left her computer with a wire plugged in the next day I go to school our school is on fire and 2 people died and for 1 month we couldn't go in our normal classes cuz of the smell and all of our books are burnt 😭"
"2574","They should keep doing this but should e-mail the parents in advance"
"2575","Throwing balls seriously."
"2576","I'm just gonna jump out a window and run from dat school"
"2577","training kids to sit there
to be targets"
"2578","That is not the right way. Every teacher should have a 12 Gauge Shotgun under the desk, filled with 00 Buckshot. This is how you keep the kids safe. And with that said, I think ever kid (16+) should get a 45. ACP. at the shool entrance."
"2579","*Lock Down Bell Rings* Teacher: Everyone get in a single file line......"
"2580","I would of stabbed the shooter with a pencil. Must seem worth it."
"2581","Attacker: all the lights are off in the school in the classrooms oh well I guess I'll go home"
"2582","school shooting drills 
only in america"
"2583","Are we all gonna ignore the fact that they threw tennis balls? What?"
"2584","8:20 watch out for the cameraman!😂😂😂"
"2585","Well when it comes to ""safety"" It's not very intelligent to sit in a corner and wait. That was told us aswell in germany where I went to highschool. I told the teacher that was standing infront of the class ""Well, if I were a homocidal killer that is certain to shoot on sight. It would only save my ammo if they would be cornerd up!"". Though It's always a bluff, kinda. Sometimes they dont shoot and just threaten on sight. But its always very dangerous. Best is to have a very decent intuition to read the person who attempts to kill someone. Going full on it as soon as possible seems more legit to me in that case. Be careful."
"2586","Here in Switzerland we don't have these drills at all"
"2587","What a fucking coincidence."
"2588","FAKE NEWS !!!!!"
"2589","My school does the lockdown and there cops and the principles knock on the door and try's opening them it's seem real but it's just a drill they say where having a lock down drill"
"2590","If there was a shooter I imagined everyone grabbing there sharp pencils and scissors and beating the heck out of them"
"2591","I wish my school did this tbh"
"2592","I lost hope in humanity, so these two girls in my class are the stereotypical white girl (Starbucks,Adidas,gossip,always talking and saying ""like"" or ""slay) 
We were having a practice drill and everyone else was taking it as seriously as it should be taken while those two were talking,smiling and laughing and they weren't even talking seriously,this was their conversation ""I need to pee"" 
""I'll pee with you"" in like this hopeful tone like the one you make when you say ""I'll die for you""

I was so mad at them and I was signing ""what the fuck guys shut up we're dead cause of you """
"2593","what school shooter uses a pistol"
"2594","All my school does is ONE fire drill PER YEAR and like 3 or 4 lockdown per year. and we live in a place where lockdowns are very rare and fires are common."
"2595","My school just locks the doors and hide we don't have a person come in and yell at us"
"2596","Everyone is talking about how they practice and everything, while in my country we hardly have a plan from earthquakes :)."
"2597","One time In 6th grade in the end of the year second last period we had math and all the sudden we had a drill then I thought it was a fire drill then later I saw my teacher and my friends barricading the doors and covering the windows my teacher told us to go to the corner all the sudden I Asher a deep man voice and a little kid crying then I thought it was the intruder but it was a janitor telling the student he's in trouble for pulling the school lockdown drill thing so there was no intruder it was just the little kid who pulled the lockdown drill thing I was so mad cause we were aloud to use the MacBooks and watch yt or Netflix or do anything in math class"
"2598","Sign- Gun Free Zone do not enter without authorization.

"2599","We never do this in England. I wonder why? (Jk I know why)"
"2600","Once my school got a threat that someone was going to take a kid home and he wasn't any of the kids parents, just going to kidnap a random child. So all the classes and the teachers at home time had to walk their classes to the school gates until parents came and everyone's parents got a text saying come pick up there children because there was a threat, and it turns out no one got kidnapped so good news👍😂"
"2601","guy: goes into classroom to kill people
kids:huddled in one area
guy: kills them all in seconds

guy:goes into classroom
kids: all have desk to throw in hands
teacher: ready to attack just in case
guy: goes in classroom and gets a concussion in seconds, loses lots of blood

"2602","This is bullshit. The attacker can easily put the victim in a rear naked choke"
"2603","130 mph come on"
"2604","Well what a suprise, when kind of everybody in the US can own a gun."
"2605","here in india, we have starvation drills"

"2608","Dumb Jews"
"2609","4:13 That's the saddest takedown I've ever seen."
"2610","Yes, gather in the corner so you can all be shot more easily."
"2611","that's why you throw a pipe bomb into the room before walking in. it's called strategy, shooters! think about it"
"2612","fukin dumbcunt americans"
"2613","Remember, no English."
"2614","Eh we lock doors in lockdown"
"2615","When we have lockdowns the kids in my classes give no fucks they fuck around laugh and all that"

"2620","you just play get sum bolls and stab him"
"2621","you know that if a guy comes in the classroom there would be more people than one so they can go like zombie mode and attack the attacker"
"2622","if this happnd at my class from grade 6 also my clas is 4 to 6 we would die becuse 1 kid would be making lots of noise by breaving and 2 other would act like assholes and make noise so yah i would be dead also im going to a newschool for grade 7 so im happy."
"2623","We never do this in my school from where I came from?"
"2624","After watching this i have the urge to stab someone in the face repeatedly with scissors"
"2625","At our school what it basically is, is hide and seek"
"2626","One time in seventh period It was close to the end of the month and there was a real drill and told the teacher to let me out. The teacher said no so I waited behind her desk with everyone else and her. with her back there I ran out of the room. after I left I ran to my backpack and grabbed my Katana (Yes I have one in my backpack for a situation like that). My class was on the east wing of the  building and they were on the south wing so I had to run. when I found the shooter they shot me in my upper leg and it hit my femer and it went out the other side I still have a scar. but with a shattered leg I still took him down while almost bleeding out. the police decided to silence the press so they didnt cover it, I'm glad I'm still alive. I was treated as a hero for a while"
"2627","Would prefer to be prepared though rather than be shot to death"
"2628","we used to do this but now we lock the door with a rope, put desks and shit infront of it and theres people in another location who watched the cameras and says where the shooter is at so we can escape when hes far away."
"2629","I don't think they should all huddle together it makes an easy target"
"2630","Why are Americans so stupid and stubborn? Fucking ban firearms and none of this would have happened!"
"2631","At my school they don't have anyone pretending to shoot we just hide under our desks wait then get up and keep working"
"2632","When there was a lockdown I started screaming with my friends Mommy!!! We were laughing so hard until we heard gunshots"
"2633","you'd think schools learn. Make learning better, try to get rid of bullying more actively, remove all the stressful things about school... but I guess changing nothing helps"
"2634","In school, I'm known to be the weakest




and yet If this happens to my school, I want to sacrifice my life XD or try to stop the threat"
"2635","I want the lady who was fighting the 220 pound guy to be my teacher"
"2636","I live in Canada and we only do lockdowns about 2 times a year. Cus random people don't got no guns OHHHHH!!!"
"2637","Well I live in the U.K. This shit don't happen here sooooo"
"2638","yeah lets all lump up all together in  a small spot so the shooter will have an easier time shooting everyone LOL are americans this stupid?"
"2639","In my old school the locks didn't work on the classroom doors"
"2640","The Spoopiest Skeleton that makes sense but my school isn't that smart to be honest so they probably won't change the rule"

"2657","badgerboi games Yeah, I'm surprised. They were fucking idiots, but Molotov is a really simple thing...



Then again, Harris broke his nose with his shotgun, cuz' it was sawed off too short"
"2658","these are the guys who tried to blow up propane bombs with shotguns. while in the same room. granted, they were suicidal, but the attack had just begun. does it surprise you that they fucked up molotovs?"
"2659","badgerboi games Well, Klebold and Harris (Lolumbine) has shitloads of these, but them didn't work. They also had Molotovs, but they didn't work either...

Now, HOW do you fuck up a Molotov?!"

"2664","Oh shit there's a fucking Eugene. Hold on let my just pull a fucking katana out of a tiny ass backpack and fucking stab that fucker. The bsfactor is high. I'm really good at stuffing a ton of stuff in a backpack but you simply can't fit a katana in there. That shit is atleast 1m long"
"2665","Luis Garcia I have had that happen before also."
"2666","We just lock the door and keep working lol"
"2667","same"
"2668","Same. I wish it was more realistic because then none of us are prepared for the real thing. I mean I live in a small town that you wouldn't expect something like this to happen but still it needs to be treated more realistically. I know that if someone tried to attack there wouldn't be a long event cause we have armed sheriffs in our school."
"2669","Trainyman 123 is too but we hide in a corner"
"2670","yeah I would love to be that person who saves everyone and ohh so cool I would be the hero.... let's be honest I would probably cry"
"2671","usman got next So what? Don't fight back and die"

"2673","BEST PERSON I HAVE EVER MET"
"2674","at least you are willing to fight"
"2675","Cheeki Ivan-HD We're not that stupid."
"2676","Cheeki Ivan-HD sadly yes. Like look at the president"
"2677","I remember during high school in my one class we had this big bathroom attached and during lock downs we would hide in it but I always hated not having an exit. It's like hunting things, have your dog at one tunnel and yourself at the other. I found it quite stupid. At least we had a door that had an exit to the side of the school and the teacher wasn't necessarily opposed to us leaving that way in case of the real deal. No matter how you put it, it's dangerous. Leaving in big groups, hiding in big groups, still a target. When bank robbers crossed through the playgrounds at my elementary school we always had to hide behind desks and out of sight. It's like everyone else's drills. They still know we're there. Closed blinds, locked doors and large windows. It's so easy to get in but hard to get out once trapped."
"2678","Yes"
"2679","yes...because it isn't people who know about guns writing this protocal its people who know nothing"
"2680","Good thing I live in Canada"
"2681","My longest lockdown was 40 minutes. Wasn't a shooter, just a former student."
"2682","what if it wasn't a drill and there was a real shooter? unexpected drills are really idiotic"
"2683","Max Caufield"
"2684","our school does these drills, and all we do is sit under our tables and close the door, bravo 👏🏻 school your totally gonna keep us all safe by doing that"
"2685","locking the door is kinda useless because they could easily shoot the door knob and enter"
"2686","Instead of just waiting for the shooter in a corner they should  redesign the classrooms layout so that teachers and students can get away out or to a panic room.  These classrooms are basically death traps."
"2687","The thing about our school is the doors to the classrooms automatically lock when they are closed as well as the front doors and all the side doors, also they're made out of metal so I like to think I'd be a little bit harder to break in. However, one time a bomb threat was called in and we couldn't go to school that day. It turned out to be false so that's good."
"2688","how to survive a school shooting: record it"
"2689","In our drill we had shut our **glass** door and place a barricade in front of it. Problem is, the thing opens outwards. So basically, real scenario, our whole class was dead"
"2690","Self defense against teachers. 
Please"
"2691","This isn't a problem in Europe."
"2692","Hhhjmn"
"2693","My school never had shooting drills"
"2694","Schools shouldn't have to do this, it shouldn't have to be a necessary thing, but unfortunately there are some evil people in the world"
"2695","Good thing we don't have Shooting Drills and lock Downs I'm lucky but fire drills..We have  fire drills"
"2696","why not put the doors or shelfs or anything you can against the doors?"
"2697","hot teacher lmao"
"2698","Give teachers with carry permits to be able to bring guns to school. Teach kids to be able to use heavy things as barricades and ramp up anti-bullying programs. That should solve the problem."
"2699","My school has a lot of drills:
Gun threat drills
Fire drills
Tsunami drills
Gas leak drills
Cyclone drills 

There's also tunnels under the school that lead up into the boys bathroom.. it's really weird.."
"2700","We had someone come to our school with a gun, a fellow freshman. Luckily, he only brought it to show off, not to kill anyone with. But he was escorted off school property by police when notified by a fellow student.

Don't be stupid."
"2701","Step 1: lock doors and close window blinds
2. Turn off all lights
3. Huddle up together
4. Stay silent and don’t socialize 
5. Wait"
"2702","They could stop all of this by just banning the guns! Because it isn't fair that children should die because of a nations incompetence."
"2703","don't you think you should have them fight instead of hide...for example have them grab a god damn book so when the shooter comes in everyone just gangbangs him.(that's what we are told to do in my school)"
"2704","lmao there are these kids trying not to laugh because they can't take the drill seriously"
"2705","first my school went on a real school lock down and and a swat team at are school making us go to a different school for that day and it was the ending of the day and also why the fuck dont you go out the window also the things they were throwing they wont stop"
"2706","It actually cool they get realistic drills because when we have a drill at my school the teachers just turn off the light and close the door but keep teaching us and one time the sixth and seventh graders were out at recess and this unknown guy jump the fence and the teachers yelled out at everyone to run into the gym that was right next to the field and everyone was as loud as possible in a real lockdown 😒"
"2707","At my school during lockdown drills, desks were often piled up at the door (and also would pull down a black curtain over doors with windows) then the entire class would go to a corner and hide there until the principal said the drill was over.

The only time I was ever in  a real lockdown was in my 5th grade year and it was happening over at the middle school nearby. Turned out everyone was over reacting to a shovel."
"2708","Bruh, id be like fuck hiding under the desk, use it to fucking block the door up!"
"2709","Once our school had a unannounced shooter drill ad I shit you not, I disarmed the guy and help him at gunpoint until a teacher told me it was only a drill"
"2710","When i heard there was a school shooter i ran away and and i got to the principals room to get the phone but i dont know the police number so i cride in the chair waiting for the shooter to leave i was the only kid in summer classes to it was a terrifying day"
"2711","what if there was two shooters"
"2712","We had a lockdown drill and me and my friend were talking in the bathroom. We didn't hear the lockdown drill since it was so quite so we carried on talking, after about a minute or two we walked out of the bathroom and to our class room we went to open the door and all we heard was screaming.."
"2713","""Don't be a hero"" yeah sure I'll just stand there in take a bullet to my kneecap"
"2714","The stupidest thing is that they pULL DOWN THE SHADE. CLEARLY IF THE SHADE IS PULLED DOWN, SOMEONE HAD TO BE IN THERE TO PULL IT DOWN."
"2715","We don't have a school shooting drill in England though we don't have any guns"
"2716","At school we had our attack alarm go off.. we heard a bang in the corridor.. we went into lock down.. we then found out a kid dropped whiteboard when he heard the drill alarm go on 😂"
"2717","Honestly they should announce at the start of year or term that at some point they will have a shooting drill and email the parents about it. That way the parents can decide if they want to tell their kids or not."
"2718","those kids are ugly tbh"
"2719","Parents should be alarmed that it is a drill before it happens."
"2720","I'd love to have this lind of drill, makes school more ""Interesting"""
"2721","At my school they used to knock on the door with windows and doors locked. They don't even do that anymore"
"2722","worse thing is even if u barricade the door ... imagine if the door opens to the opposite side .. 😂😂😂 you're dead ."
"2723","Necessary if you go to a Jewish school in Paris."
"2724","during my sophomore year we got stuck from like 2pm to 4pm. it was a real lockdown but it was just a threat and like nothing happened, except like 10 police cars, six k9s, 2 fucking swat teams, 4 news reporters.... my fuckkng class didnt believe it and they were talking until i had to go on twitter and show them tweets of other students in other classes saying they were hearing gunshots. 😐"
"2725","the job of the news is to cause these tragedies. most shooters are inspired from the evil events seen on the news. this violemce is not increasing it is being more televised"
"2726","this is absolutely disgusti . lets be honest and realistic these attacksmare actually becoming less common and personally if a school shootermcomes to my school i will do as i was told and throw a chair when they begin to look away"
"2727","Don't use shades. The shades make the shooter suspects the class."
"2728","Why would they even do this to kids 😐"
"2729","this is bullshit, because a woman wouldn't be doing that in a gun fight, and all he'd have to do even if this happened is shot the gun a few times, hoping it shoot her as she's held onto her, and stuff, and if theirs pupils around they wouldn't do this because random fire and a shot could kill a couple of people"
"2730","This could be really tramautic for a child. A child could develop ptsd, or a mild version of it from these, even if its fake. The newtown/sandy hook  schools cant to this because it could trigger flashbacks and anxiety attacks. Even if the school hasnt had any history with violence, that doesnt mean the childeren are all fearless and wont have any problem with it. Lockdowns drills are important, but involving guns, blood and violence could make a real situation even worse, because the real situation could trigger tramautic flashbacks or associations to the fake one, crippling and threatening the child. Also, this is coming from a person who has studied and witnessed the effects of trauma on childeren."
"2731","Um, if there's someone in the building, then why tf would you announce over the speakers, but if you didn't how would you know that the shooter was there? :/"
"2732","*Plays Pumped Up Kids*"
"2733","My School had a lock down at 8:00 am  and then 3:00 pm it was scary"
"2734","I'm British I don't have to deal with 'school shootings' or 'lockdowns'"
"2735","For our school a drill is 30 min"
"2736","Be honest wwyd if someone starts crying hard"
"2737","TO THE YOUNG and UP COMING ADULTS:   Sorry for the world the Govt is presenting to you.  QUESTION ALL SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.  All of them.  You will discover: MANY are NOT  real.  The Govt wants to scare you and make you dependent on THEM for food and all your SAFETY NEEDS.   remember: there are more of US than them:  you can protect yourself."
"2738","So why is it hard for people to believe that SANDY HOOK WAS A DRILL with extensive use of all local, state and homeland security depts?   Toss in some porta potties, clergy:  a man dressed up as a nun, and extras."
"2739","Better run better run outrun my gun"
"2740","They do a drill for like 5 mins my school does a rill for like 20 mins"
"2741","i thought this was posted on 4/20"
"2742","They need to practice because in America people can walk with a gun in the street like wtf ?? 😂"
"2743","the kids at my school JOKE and act like its no big deal during lockdowns! I hate it!!!!"
"2744","It's kinda scary looking at that little teachers face stacking that guy she's just smashing his hand😐"
"2745","my school drill is dumb we turn off the lights and hide in a corner  like oh that's the lights are off in every class room guess no ones here ........ dumbest shit everrrrr"
"2746","Oh right, this looks like a first world country scenario."
"2747","My fear in school was if a school shooting happened or the fire alarm went off if I was on the toilet or if I was changing into my PE kit!!"
"2748","Anybody else just weirded out by how simply it would be for the shooter to just pull the fire alarm and wait outside once everybody is huddled"
"2749","At my elementary school, we had someone smoking weed and had a gun on them out on the playground so we had a lock out. It was scary."
"2750","If this happens at my school, I'm going to grab a fire exinguisher and knock him the hell out."
"2751","One time at my school, we had a lockdown that lasted 2.5 hours and the police came, turns out just a dumb kid hit the emergency button."
"2752","This is why I bring a knife to school"
"2753","once it happen in my school there was a guy with a gun it took 2 hours until ot all ended"
"2754","Imagine being a shooter on the day they had one of these drills. You have everyone ripe for the pickings. Officers with no weapons, students who won't initially run away, even volunteers to the slaughterhouse. I endorse these drills. 👌"
"2755","Tennis balls is gonna hurt someone isn't it 😂👍🏼"
"2756","At my school they did a lock down a fire drill and my teacher didn't now what to do"
"2757","Wish they made it realistic. When I was in high school, kids treated it like a joke. some were playing music and being stupid during all of this and I was thinking if this was real, You'd get us all killed you fucking morons"
"2758","You know this is wonderful that they're teaching teachers defense statistics but what if a future shooter watches this video and knows what to do already?"
"2759","It would be sick to have the whole school attack one shooter. Savage level 10000000000000000000000000%"
"2760","I had 2 lockdowns so far that lasted for like 2 hours each. one was because someone I believe robbed a bank nearby and another was because there was ammo found in a bathroom and I know who it was. I sort of wish my school was do a realistic drill"
"2761","In my school, our school shooting drills are like really weak. The one thing I like about it is instead of the principal announcing it like, LOCKDOWN LOCKDOWN. She whispers in the PA a code that the teachers know and they would tell us to begin the lockdown procedure and we would all go in the corner. We have lockers in the classroom so smaller kids would go in the locker or the closest. The kids in the corner would have to form a barrier with the desks and chairs as quietly as they can. Then the teacher locks the door and covers the window, then goes behind her desks"
"2762","I am that one kid who literally sit in the middle in the back so if a shooter comes I ain't going first"
"2763","This is my school...........


Principal:""Lockdown all over the school are in effect.""

Shooter:Does he know I heard that?"""
"2764","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS BETTER RUN BETTER RUN OUTRUN MY GUN"
"2765","BOUNCY BALLS BITCH"
"2766","That's going to be my school"
"2767","Reality bites dude. Our school all we do is hide and turn off the damn lights, I would sure like to be in a situation were they hire actual police officers into the school for the drill."
"2768","Why I have a slingshot on hand at all times"
"2769","Well damn at my school these drills last 40+ minutes"
"2770","I came here from Laura Grace!"
"2771","that's a good idea teaching teachers self defense against gunmen."
"2772","I don't understand how huddling up in a corner helps. I've always wondered."
"2773","Of course this was near Tampa lol"
"2774","Jeezus, reading all these posts from kids here comparing their school's lockdown drills- and even making jokes about them. I graduated HS in 1990 and when someone shot the school water tower twice during the year, there was no lockdown, no SWAT teams, hell I didn't even see cops, though I'm sure some were around at some point taking a report. The 1st time it was shot we got the day off, the 2nd they made us come to school and suffer all day with no running water. I remember boys making jokes about armor piecing rounds and rifle calibers, and what deer rifles they had at home. Aside from this, we had a teacher who would bring up the 1911 pistol every so often, and give us the history of it. I wonder if he had a big collection of them at home. I was mad when we had an assignment in gov't class where we had to do some big study and present some crap about it to the class, when the teacher assigned some other kid to do gun control. I was pissed off lol. Oh and all this no big deal about guns, but when I did a drawing of myself with cat eyes and claws I was sent to the guidance counselor lol. Anyway, we had fire drills and everyone thought it was funny, so I can see where you are all coming from. I guess..."
"2775","this is funny because of all the hard lockdowns ive had at my high school (not drills) lol ._."
"2776","How about fire drills"
"2777","I will carry an airsoft gun if this type o drill happens. It will be funny."
"2778","sadly at my school the walls peering into the halls are just big windows and we have blinds but they aren't even bullet proof sooo any time we talk about schools shootings my teacher says you all are going through the India facing outside and we will run to a house"
"2779","Couldn't the gunman just bend his wrist a bit to shoot the student or teacher that's trying to stop him?"
"2780","Weezyojuice tornado drills"
"2781","Weezyojuice our school is messed up. Not many schools have a cyclone drill in our area. It's pretty stupid but we still have it. We don't even get cyclones, but I guess we get bad storms.."
"2782","Bella Hayes wtf are cyclone drills"
"2783","BlaBlah Tube 😂😂😂😂"
"2784","BlaBlah Tube lol"
"2785","at my school we leave the door blind open and huddle in a line"
"2786","I'd would slap them then tell em to shut up tbh"
"2787","VIVACE but that would also give more room to run and a lot of people will escape"
"2788","VIVACE that's really smart, thx for the idea, jk😂"
"2789","It's so it the shooter bust the window he can't get to us. If he get in the room that's when you start throwing shit"
"2790","iRaccoon same"
"2791","Firstly so they cant see you from the door window, the door should be locked and you can taken cover with desks /whatever else in the room. Basically make it as difficult as possible  for the attacker as to spare time, that's mostly all you can do, or go out the windows perhaps."
"2792","Yeah, when the shoters get grabbed they still got an arm left while the teacher is using both to imobbilize the gun. The shooter could easily start punching, or even going for the eyes of the person trying to resist."
"2793","Chouxer try thinking in a 1/100th of a second and its too late so no"
"2794","That drill where they have to stop them is so bullshit what if there is two of them, what if they shoot them before they get grabbed, what if the shooter is actually pretty well built and the teacher is weak so many fucking flaws easy enough is to just introduce gun licenses"
"2795","Resonant Reads Yeah as someone who has a fucking wall of guns, the pure force of a gun would demolish your wrist."
"2796","Makes me glad schools out..."
"2797","if i hear gunshots i am not hiding in the corner I'm opening the window and wiggling my way out"
"2798","BIHHH when they do these at my high school we all literally take naps or just talk 💀💀 yall out here wildin with the fake guns and stuff 💀💀"
"2799","School tells me to hide but I would take a pencil or scissors and if the shooter comes in the room I would aim for the shooters face or neck!"
"2800","Screw hiding, I'd be making a prison shank from a plastic chair!!!"
"2801","jeez i like this information!"
"2802","I will just run out of the school"
"2803","she is a really nice teacher"
"2804","WHY THE FUCK ARE Y'ALL SITTING DUCKS IN A CORNER??? FUCKING HIDE??"
"2805","The longest REAL lockdown took 2 hours"
"2806","at my school everyone has their own desk, and in a lockdown, we hide under them. I get up and see legs and butts across the room. Its like trying to use a stall, there's no point in privacy. you can still see them"
"2807","Columbine was the worst school shooting in history. You expect to just get in a corner with nothing behind the door. The shooter could break through the door for god's sakes!"
"2808","me"
"2809","Why are all the comments about the song ""Pumped up Kicks"""
"2810","kinda easy to know where the kids are at if they lock the doors and the rest are unlocked"
"2811","Wouldn't doing these drills without announcing it's a drill first actually be bad because kids would start to relax and not care that there might be a shooter in the building because they would think it's just a drill?"
"2812","d-do i go to the only school in america where we have absolutely no drills for shootings"
"2813","There was a lockdown in our school. I almost went out of the Lab and almost died. good thing i didn't. I remember i was in the science lab working on my project with my 2 friends. I was holding  a bleach. When we heard there was a lockdown we three agreed to hide in the cabinets. I hid in a cabinet. When the shooters came in they were looking all around even the cabinets. when one shooter opened the cabinet where i was i throwed a bleach on his face and he was burning. i did on the same 2 shooters and called for my friends. good thing we got some more bleach to pour on the other shooters. Finally we went back to our class and we were ready to spill some bleach over their faces "
"2814","At my school we usually do drills during first period (science) and every lab desk is separated by about a meter so we hide between them but we'd probably die if there was an actual shooting."
"2815","if u are on your first day at school and u went hunting and u forgot to leave your pocket knife at home but there was a shooting would u? a. report that u have a knife and kill the shooter or b.stab the shooter's arm with the gun in it"
"2816","Teachers should have a firearm (small) with ammunition in their desks. If they have to shoot, they shoot, protect. Then, for the safety of the school, and teacher, they should be relocated."
"2817","Let me tell you what we do in a school shooting in my school: we frikin get in the corner of the room and sit there until there gone... Last year we only had 2 Drills"
"2818","OMFG, do they seriously have to do this is America?"
"2819","There's a difference between an earthquake and a school shooting."
"2820","I live in the safest country so We never had lockdown drills We have 2 guards at the entry no other way to enter you need a pass to enter with 1 guard atleast in every building"
"2821","Or... just hide behind the door, and when the shooter comes through, knock his skull the fuck in."
"2822","Guns don't kill people; Americans with guns kill people."
"2823","at my school everyone one in my class would fight back"
"2824","When I was in 2nd or 1st grade we had a lockdown for like 6 hours because a kid thought there was a man with a weapon in the woods"
"2825","lol all we do is turn off all the lights, lock the doors, and then sit in a little corner. Half the time the teacher forgets that she's not supposed to answer the police and unlock the door, and everyone's not even staying quiet. We had a 'real' lock down once, (someone didn't sign in to the office) I was in the bathroom and I was thinking that I was going to rasengan his ass once he got in. We were supposed to go to the nearest classroom, but I still needed to shit DX 

They told us if we were in the bathroom, to just stand on the toilets to not be seen but I was still in the middle of my business. After that, I never went to the bathroom during school and developed bad bladder problems. Yay"
"2826","we one time had a lockdown drill in second grade, and i all of a sudden had to ""let it rip"", half the class was rolling on the ground laughing"
"2827","I don't care how cliche it sounds, I'm 100% ready to take a bullet to save the people in my college class. This is cliche too but, they are my family and I love them like I love my family."
"2828","australia has no shooting so we have lockdowns every 6 months"
"2829","Last year in my school we were having a drill but we didn't know that at the time so all I heard was ""Lockdown! Lockdown!"" And I heard *BOOM BOOM BOOM* down the hallway and saw kids running and screaming and I was like ""oh hell nah"" and I ran into that fucking closet at the speed of light"
"2830","If I were in the hall, I would get in a locker if I could... am I the only what that would do that?"
"2831","thanks"
"2832","Or give teachers gun training, and they keep one locked in their desk"
"2833","In my old school, we would actually try to be relaxed during the process. First, my teacher would lock the door, turn on blinds, and turn off the lights. We would all join her and barricade all doors and windows, even vents lol. Then, we would grab our backpacks and use them as cover while hiding under her desk. She would then silently pass out teeny peppermint candies so we couldn't open our mouths. But, they were so tiny we couldn't choke. What a great school I graduated from."
"2834","When we have lock down drills everyone in our class just talk about their nails or laugh"
"2835","we had a fake shooter at a Walmart next to us and we went into a lock down just incase and i texted my mom that we were in lock down snd she knew what it was at Walmart and the next day i got in trouble for no fucking reason XD"
"2836","at about 7:38 this shooter said ""OH YOU'RE ALIVE! NOW YOU'RE DEAD!!! YOU'RE DEAD!!!! NEXT!?!?!?"" I couldn't help but laugh."
"2837","I have been in a lock down where helicopters were flying over the school"
"2838","I never had a shooting drilll"
"2839","how did i get here from pumped up kicks"
"2840","I'm sorry but who the fuck hides behiend the desk.  Wat if the shooter has bombs and then locks the door fam"
"2841","""Wth, the lights are turned off in almost every classroom and it's 11am on a Tuesday day. There must be no kids I guess time to go home"""
"2842","ALICE"
"2843","Wow I was in a real lock down and it wasn't nearly as bad as these drills"
"2844","I'll stab the fuck out of that bitch"
"2845","I want this in my school."
"2846","Yup let's just show the school shooter we're we hide"
"2847","Hide behind a desk?

Fuck that take some scissors and stab the shooter"
"2848","what does sitting in a corner do I know help the shooter spray the whole group together"
"2849","LMFAO. Their solution for a school shooter: Huddle in a corner where you all can get shot with ease! A bullet hits your friend, passes through him and hits you! NOW YOU HAVE AIDS!"
"2850","I have had one look down drill 3 years ago in 3 grade"
"2851","People want to hurt kids because you dumbasses won't treat us like humans!
I already have got plans to backfire this bullshit you teach, you use a gun with a extended magazine. You reload when it's safest to."
"2852","my teacher i 2 grade said when that hapens go to her desk before that grab a book to throw"
"2853","*School shooter approaches classroom with locked door* ""Rain drop.""

*everyone inside* ""Drop top!"""
"2854","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks, you better run, better run faster than my bullet"
"2855","Wot shit is that wot did thay do to you if you  want to die just put in one in your hed you shoot 50 kids them wot them wot all those who think it's OK to shoot schools up need to die"
"2856","Y schools y not cops  koz kids can't fight  back"
"2857","im in 7th grade and my class doesn't even no how to control them self fire drills"
"2858","I should do this to my brother muahahahah!"
"2859","one time I was in a look down it took around 30 minutes"
"2860","1 cent and I'll shoot up my school"
"2861","Honestly if there's was a actual shooter, would you throw balls at them? Like they thinks that's gonna do. Something but srsly the shooter has a ACTUAL gun."
"2862","Fuck it will make my job harder, but anyway i gonna gun down my whole school anyways..."
"2863","Why can't my school teach us this drill"
"2864","when the bully forgets he put you in the locker and you come out and attack the shooter"
"2865","yeah sit them all in one corner thats a confirmed multikill idiots"
"2866","There was a shooting in a barber shop across the street from my school in first grade I'm in 6th grade now and we were in that room for 8 hours it was so scary"
"2867","rather jump out the window and sneak away I would like if u would BECAUSE MY SCHOOL HIDES IN A CORNER"
"2868","I dont understand why they fuckin have kids huddle in a corner, if the shooter has a makeshift explosive of sorts, he lobs one in there, its fucking over man."
"2869","When we had a drill it was for a hour and we had a real one and it lasted for 3 hr"
"2870","Let's instead equip teachers with fire extinguishers. The fire extinguisher, when sprayed directly at a shooter, would make it hard for them to breathe and to see. If it runs out, no problem! Hit them with it! It's metal! Teaching the school to be passive and hide is obviously doing nothing. Giving teachers a gun could backfire for obvious reasons."
"2871","Thx ABC im telling my head teacher about this NOW"
"2872","and all my teachers said never go behind her desk"
"2873","if there is a active shooter in my school there is no shooting drill its called a lock down drill"
"2874","That is horrible. I know the teachers need to let them practice but the first time must be terrifying.😨"
"2875","Fuck getting behind the desk im gonna get a pencil and stab a bitch!😂"
"2876","Now I know your plan to survive."
"2877","I would of became insane at that instant and came at the shooter withthe intent to KILL. I will risk my life for my friends and teachers future. Also they should be armed or have a weapon when there hiding just in case."
"2878","What if the shooter... IS IN THE CLASSROOM!?
That's my plan. Shoot up the school during a lock-down.
People will think it's part of the drill."
"2879","My school doesn't do any of this and we have shooter threats like every week"
"2880","fuck that better push somebody in the way"
"2881","yooo I would die cuz of the idiots in my class laughing and screaming"
"2882","Guys... WE DONT HAVE AN LOCK HOW DO WE DO THIS NOW IF THEIRS AN LOCKDOWN ALL OF US ARE FUCKED GOOD..... I have an Idea get two or three boys in front of the door make sure there 100 pounds then If the shooters come in appreand them like your playing yandere sim when the gym teacher gets u then If he fall get the gun from him any wepon that h fucking got get chairs to throw at him or something will annoy him
Then get your lunch put your peanut butter sandwich to her hideous face then help get him open the window throw him up then done.walla BON appetite BEBY"
"2883","After a shooter drill we had a real active shooter but we did not take it seriously"
"2884","Then maybe they should arm the teachers the drills don't work if you have common sense."
"2885","Everyone in my class is so fucking annoying and loud. We would be the first one shot."
"2886","I'm probably on the FBI's watch list."
"2887","🎵better lock the doors and turn the lights down lowwwww!🎵"
"2888","More like a Lockdown. I'm sure everyone's been in a lockdown. A shooting drill is the same thing as the lock down"
"2889","HA! My classmates are always whispering and giggling like there's no tomorrow; can't wait to see their faces when there's a real one"
"2890","one time my school announced there was a school shooter inside the building and next week they announced that they mistook that person for holding a gun it was actually a bottle of beer and that person was sneaking it in class"
"2891","I would just kick them in the balls XD"
"2892","*ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KIDS BETTER RUN BETTER RUN FASTER THAN MY GUN*"
"2893","1:04 ""police came in with guns and im kinda scared"" Wtf"
"2894","omg in 5th grade we had a practice and we were reading and my teacher said ""Sam,Ashley just move out of the windows"".she didn't even hide us and then someone was trying to open the door and my teacher just started laughing and smileing and she ran to the door to close it and then we went outside to count us"
"2895","once my school had an actual lockdown for the funniest reason:a mouse had got out and it was loose and not traned running rampid  around our neighborhood (i go to a small neighborhood school)"

"2906","Was it a drill? Or an actual lockdown"
"2907","Prince Amir Good point. And thank you for reacting to my comment in a mature way ;]."
"2908","Bleached Chihuahua Well I feel as of us people can't get access to guns then police officers shouldn't either. As you can see news wide most police officers lately haven't buy using their ""weapon army"" quite right lately. If some shit pops off us people need not to rely on the ""government"" or the ""police"" to protect us! Your fist/feet/ and combat skill can only go so far."
"2909","Prince Amir Then if we are able to have access to guns. Then wouldn't other people be able to access to them too? And somebody can kill you easily with a gun. I rather let licensed hunters and police officers have guns."
"2910","Amanda12378 ...Was the ""Shut Up"" part that necessary?"
"2911","Bleached Chihuahua guns are easier because you can then take down the intruder without coming into large contact with them. Personally I'd prefer using a dart gun over anything"
"2912","Maddie Mountcastle the intercoms messed up one time during a drill"
"2913","Maddie Mountcastle We had a lockdown one time the week before spring break because a guy had a remote control skateboard and a few people thought the controller was a gun. SWAT officers were surrounding our doors for an hour, scary shit."
"2914","When I was grade five or six, I went to a teacher cuz' I felt like I was being watched. No joke, I still have major paranoia. .. . ."
"2915","No that wouldn't cause 6 hours is a full school day and they wouldn't do that just cause a kid said so a teacher would check first"

"2924","ClawedMonet My school did something similar once. It was a drill for the teachers, but some drama students were asked to bang on the doors and scream, whilst the teachers were in the classroom. It was intense and tbh I'd do it again but if that's how all our lockdowns went it wouldn't be the best thing ever."

"2930","My teacher in jewelry told us what to do if there is a shooter who comes in our class: take a weapon (there are plenty, from chairs to C-clamps to freaking FIRE) and try to kill the dude. In the end, the maniac is going to do that, so we're not giving him the satisfaction of taking our lives, too."
"2931","I'd grab a chair and start smashing away"
"2932","Shayla Kees i would throw scissors lmao"
"2933","Shayla Kees it might throw the shooter off guard then bam you tackle him? Idk"
"2934","400th like"

"2979","Uhh there was someone in my school and we got so scared I ran and kicked him in the balls"
"2980","Lock downs don't do anything. Just consolidates the area of where you can shoot."
"2981","This needs to be done at every school, because at my high school we had a drill and the kids there were laughing and throwing things around and no one was paying attention to the real situation going outside that door. This is a very serious thing."
"2982","Those kids at 2:34 are actually mature. At my high school, the students start giggling and talk."
"2983","When we watched a video about what to do in case there was a school shooter, this kid walked outside, yelled, ""School shooter!"" And popped opened his bag of chips. Turns out that every class had just watched the video and a bunch of teachers nearby emailed our teacher to watch that kid."
"2984","School shooting in my classroom=Gunman dead"
"2985","If they did this in my school imma get out the classroom just to get the full experience. All the fake blood, fake dead bodies... the hunger games is on bitch"
"2986","In my fucking school we just lock the damn door and they keep fucking teaching."
"2987","Yeah take him to the ground and wrestle him..."
"2988","""Lets sit in the corner, lock the doors, and hope they don't break in!"""
"2989","In my school, p.s 249, in Brooklyn New York, We do this,
The Principal Announces That it is a Lockdown Drill, (6/10 Chance that Teachers already know), 
Then Students go away from the door And Sit down and teachers Lock doors, Sometimes Cover Door windows, and Turn the lights off.
WHAT WE DO NOT DO: WE DO NOT Have Polices in the building WITH GUNS, We don't throw anything, and we Definitely Don't attack back! 
P.S That video Scared me I thought it was a real killer, WHAT SCHOOL DOES THAT?!"
"2990","3:47 omg I wish my school was like this Lmao"
"2991","Man, if there was a school shooter like this who just fucking screamed, I would've just left school and climbed the gate and booked it for home lmao"
"2992","Sad that America even needs these drills..."
"2993","shiiiit the only drill we did in my day was the tornado drill!!!"
"2994","Kids you guys have fidget spinners so make them very shark and throw them or shove it up his throat."
"2995","Where are their black trench coats?"
"2996","We had a real lockdown but nobody realized it was real until we were held 30 minutes after school ended and everybody was like *oh shoot* 
Nobody was hurt luckily"
"2997","When clowns where big allot of kids in my class sharped all their pencils and waited for the clown to kick the door down"
"2998","being in a real one not a drill it is a lot different"
"2999","Anyone else still in school but watching this"
"3000","If someone were to shoot up the school, chances r if u lock and barricade the door they will pass. They r looking for easy access and to kill as many people as possible quickly. Theyre not going to sit there for 30 seconds trying to bust down a door"
"3001","sitting by a teacher's decks is not safe"
"3002","At my school they used to tell us to sit in the corner, but now in drills, they tell us to grab pens, staplers, or even chairs to throw at an intruder if they came in our room, the school is teaching us to attack and evacuate"
"3003","Cancerous"
"3004","The school should give unannounced drills, but only tell the parents. Like, send a call to all the parents, and tell them not to tell the students. That way the teachers have to figure out what to do, what the students have to do, what they have learned during the announced drills. Just to put the kids and students to the test."
"3005","do our teachers really do this?😂"
"3006","Who's fucking fault you were speeding?"
"3007","The intruder alarm went off before our Gcse exam. We didn't know it was a drill. Loads of people barricaded the door. We thought a were gonna die"
"3008","I'm happy I'm not living there anymore"
"3009","I'm happy I'm not living there anymore"
"3010","Someone gonna get their ass whooped if they put hands on my"
"3011","whats it like to not have second  amendment rights and live in fear because of the media? must be fun eh sheep?"
"3012","Fucking hell this is horrible come live in Australia"
"3013","my school was next to a cash Express and one time it was robbed. it was 3rd grade and the cops called our school and said go into lockdown. my crush was crying a wanted to hug her. I didn't really care about anything Else except her."
"3014","one time we had a lockdown in my town I was held gun point and i had to be the hero i didnt take those defence training for nothing and lucky i dis armed him and i shot him and i was rewarded for saving the school/class room there was only one man thats very lucky usually itss 3 for 4 men"
"3015","or just use fake guns
maybe even let the parents know"
"3016","not trying to be rude but I don't feel sorry for people who say they have been through it if they knew what was happening to the person that shot people and knew they were being bullied and didn't do anything not saying she was a witness though"
"3017","if the shooters went to school and learned what to do in a lockdown i think they would know if the door was closed and the lights were off that the students were in there 
lol lmao😂😂😂"
"3018","At the end of the day some people will die but I rather go out fighting on my feet then,with my head down on my knees waiting to die"
"3019","One time these guys just walked through our school and the school thought they were shooters but they were just walking through the school"
"3020","*HOW ABOUT YOU MAKE SURE THAT NO SHOOTER IS COMMING? THANK YOU.*"
"3021","Let's be honest here, in a real school shooting, they'll be sh#t scared."
"3022","Man school shooter are great they help reduce trash and because they are in a group it makes it easier. Thanks Abc"
"3023","One time this guy made a bomb threat to our school that he would drown two of us, in a lake nearby in front of all of us while lined up. I was so scared omg"
"3024","wait isi'nt like kinda sexist that the actor for the school shooter is a man?"
"3025","So I had to watch this training video for my summer job at walmart. It was about active shooters, and what associates should do. It had this white dude walk up in an empty aisle and take his ak out of its gun bag. Then, had this ole dude stockin shelves glance over and saw him.....nigga dipped out the door"
"3026","I would too even if it was just an act, I'd cry my eyes out and be completely terrified. When  I would find out I'd be SOOO MAD!!!!😠"
"3027","(How a school reacts)





ALRIGHT STUDENTS HURRY GO UNDER YOUR DESKS!!!!!!!!!!"
"3028","Durning a drill my friend when a teacher tried to open the door he loudly said
""Nobody es here right now!"" 
The teacher just told him to be quiet."
"3029","Bro my school is actually so stupid. it was the first school shooting drill that my school district did and basically you would barricade the door and the staff would announce where the shorter is in the school and if the shooter was on the opposite side of the school, you would take down the barricade and you would run through the hall and out the doors and you would run to this field. 


The high schoolers this year did a drill where they would have to run away from the school to this park that was far away."
"3030","Our schools lockdowns have been real and it was hella scary. Plus our practice lockdowns go on for 15 minutes"
"3031","My principle did not tell us so I freaked out I heard noses"
"3032","6:15 girl just hurry up and punch him already"
"3033","If I had a drill like this I would tell everyone to get a chair or a really sharp object or light and when you hear footsteps out side hold them up and grin.😏"
"3034","I wish I was a teacher"
"3035","for some reason which kinda scares me i want a disaster too happen at my school like (but not limited to) tornados,earthquakes,blackout,school shootout,etc"
"3036","How do you train students and teachers to train for a school shooter?




Me: I KNOW!!!

*Plays ""Pumped Up Kicks""*"
"3037","I don't have drills like this in my school because nobody in my country really has guns"
"3038","Whenever my school goes into a lockdown everyone laughs and talks because they want to"
"3039","ninjapig same i hope we safe"
"3040","At my school, there was a bomb threat, and my smart ass teachers ordered everyone to huddle in the corner and no one was allowed to use their phones. Because hiding in a corner is going to save us from a fucking bomb."
"3041","In my country that never happened to my school..at least in aware of.. so I'm not scared especially that the city im in is peaceful so yeah..."
"3042","CONGRATULATIONS YOU TRIGGERED A COLUMBINE FLASHBACK!"
"3043","You mother f*cker"
"3044","Roiice 
Lets practice with paintball guns then"
"3045","What was a better idea is A: find a non windowed door B: lock it down with furniture and lock C: If the man has the strength of Zeus and some how opens it with his fists, fight"
"3046","Dylan Dietz it doesnt just gives the illusion of safty...realy the best yhing to do is ambush them/fight back...dont cower in a corner waiting to die"
"3047","bbygrl 715b Your teacher was reckless, and would get you killed in a real scenario."
"3048","Dylan Dietz It keeps you out of view, ergo, avoids making you a target. A shooter is a lot less likely to successfully shoot someone that he can't even find. And they probably won't waste time trying to break down a door if they can't see potential targets inside."
"3049","BloodthirstyPikachu I agree but my all my teachers have us sitting a desks"
"3050","Gurl-19 Or brazil or germany or japan or scotland or any country that has GUN CONTROL this  is why this  has happened on the United States  so many times because any idiot can get a gun at any moment."
"3051","some random girl I"
"3052","lol"
"3053","Fuck school, Logic all the way"
"3054","some random girl see my school failed to mention it was a drill, my friends and I ran to my car and drove off"
"3055","It's 2017, how come no kid wanna beat the shit outta a school shooter"
"3056","i kinda want them to do this at our school (notifying parents ahead of time of course). yes, it'd be terrifying and i would cry and be scared shitless, but i also feel like it would benefit my fellow students  to put some fear in them bc some really dont take it seriously. i'd volunteer to be a fake dead person but im in the theatre department so they'd probably know i was acting unless theyre too frantic to realize it."
"3057","If I was in a school shooting I grab every thing in the class room and slam it against the door and hide in a cabinet if a teacher tried to stop me I would smack them and run"
"3058","I remember one time we had an actual intruder drill and it was actually a dog that somehow got into the building😂😂😂"
"3059","Why the hell do these kids have phones let alone in school?"
"3060","There's been 3 school shootings in my country and it's been 9 years since the last one, we don't even do school shooting drills"
"3061","i was all like : damn some savage teachers"
"3062","Like in the first part"
"3063","OMG THATS SCARY :o !!!"
"3064","Bitch! While the teacher is spinning  around and trying to disarm the shooter... the barrel of the gun has been pointed probably 10 students..."
"3065","You're not supposed to text your parents regardless during a lockdown, because you're leading them right to the danger if it's a real situation"
"3066","This so cool because the teacher that got to do it 2 times the second time was so awesome she was about to yell"
"3067","That's fucked"
"3068","rule #1 dont fucking text your parents it makes it harder for cops to get there if its real"
"3069","0:23 WTF Billy why the hell did you load this gun.. dude it has to look real bro."
"3070","just give the kids some scissors and let them go ham."
"3071","I live in the uk so this doesn't happen but to know that this actually happens shocks me why would any one want to hurt inicont kids I feel luck that this doesn't happen in my school but I am shocked someone would just go ahead and shoot a child with no care just why would they??...."
"3072","They are pussies"
"3073","I can't imagine this happening for real. My school does this but not that extreme. I can't imagine the parents when they don't warn them"
"3074","shit fuck all the hiding in the corner im goin to fucking bring a knife to school"
"3075","tampa florida? i live there ;-;"
"3076","Ik this is not related to a school shooting..but it kinda is


When there is a fire drill, why do they tell people to walk calmly?
FFS WHEN THERE IS A FIRE IM RUNNING RIGHT THE FUCK OUT, IDK ABOUT YOU BUT I ANT WALKING SLOWLY OUT THOSE DOORS"
"3077","Thanks ABC next time there's a school shooter,they will know our plan"
"3078","I'm a school shooter don't show kids this video"
"3079","My school is does not do this"
"3080","in my school we had a drill, but instead of hiding we climed out the windows and ran as far as we could with our classmates"
"3081","OH MY GOD LOCK THE STUPID DOORS!!!"
"3082","My school locks the doors (the doors are usually locked), we have sheets of paper taped over the door and we all hide as far from the door as possible."
"3083","amen when im in 6th grade"
"3084","Warning the thing Ian about to say is mean/rude no harm intended: 

What do you a call a five (5) year old with no friends? A sandy hook survivor."
"3085","BELL!!!!"
"3086","What kind of dick  would go to school and kill kids"
"3087","Everyone is arguing that they aren't safe under desks and chairs. But let me tell YOU something. Where else do you want kids to hide if a real shooter comes into their school huh? A classroom is literally full of desks and chairs. It's the only place where they can hide trying to not be seen. Smh"
"3088","I live in England so we don't have those drills"
"3089","We had a lockdown at our high school and it was me and my girlfriends gym period we were at the fence of our track so when the alarm went off we drove off"
"3090","The way they did this lockdown drill made me so mad! They shouldn't have done a drill like this!!"
"3091","So the teachers think hiding behind a desk will be the safest spot. You can see them from the door lmao!"
"3092","At my school we had a lockdown.  It was during recess when me and my friend were going to get late breakfast when my principal ran after us and started to push us to the nearest classroom we didn't know what was going on so we were really scared.  Turns out that this man was running down the street with a police car and they passed by our school."
"3093","Better to learn and be scared then to be scared and not know what to do"
"3094","Welcome to Los Santos."
"3095","Because I'm in a different building to Learn (we have the main school and a little building which I'm in the little building because that's where the oldest children are) We Can easily hide because we are aloud in the classroom next to us and also the toilets (obviously) but what they do is they lock the door, close the blinds and tell us to be quiet in our seat, we don't even hide! It's not safe!"
"3096","we had a lock down once I was in second grade and we had to stay in school 2 more hours 😧"
"3097","Me: *Reads description* -_-"
"3098","I'd love this"
"3099","I remember having drills but nobody shouting in the halls....."
"3100","In our school we get anything we have and block the door with desks. Since our teacher is obese we have to help her in her wheelchair super quick while the strongest kid(me)has to get behind the door with one other kid and try to disarm the shooter. Our first drill the dude ran his head into the desk. Mission Accomplished"
"3101","The longest lock down i ever had was almost an hour"
"3102","I brought 2 pocket knifes and gave one to my teachers"
"3103","One thing I don't understand about the way schools prepare for school shooters is how they instruct us to take cover behind desks...The shooter would easily walk around and kill us if he got through the barricade so if we all know that we're going to die no matter what, why not hide behind the barricade and attack if he comes in??? Or am I stupid and forgot an important detail?"
"3104","not all schools do ylthis though"
"3105","I would be scared to death! Drill or not!"
"3106","I had a lockdown drill for a robber that is looking for a place to hide I am pretty sure and we were there for 20 mins"
"3107","back in school there was a drill my teacher said to go under those tiny ass desks like what? no corner? no smart board turned off? WE WERE JUST SITTING DUCKS"
"3108","During our schoollockdown alot of the kids didnt know it was a drill but i did cause it was on the principles calender so when we ""Hid"" in our classrooms I played pumped up kicks with my phone on loud best detention i have ever gotten"
"3109","That is a awful school but I like the training "
"3110","awww i wish i had holly as my teacher❤❤❤"
"3111","If there was a drill I would attack and swear and I would tackle that person through the glass window for my crush"
"3112","I would jump out of the window"
"3113","On my school all in my classroom  don't take it serious we laugh and then get in trouble then a kid farted when it was in lockdown and everybody where laughing hard"
"3114","OK, so these drills with ""active shooters"" are I'll admit to extreme, here in south Carolina we just huddle in the corner or against the wall, we have the principal go around and say, ""I can see you"""
"3115","the fucking kids who would play chopsticks in the mother fucking dark would kill all of this"
"3116","ABCS David Wright
Since when do mets players work for abc"
"3117","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS YOU BETTER RUN BETTER RUN OUTRUN MY GUN ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS YOU BETTER RUN BETTER RUN OUTRUN MY BULLET"
"3118","I'd get my auntie to take them down. She's a gold medal ju-jitsu fighter"
"3119","Almost all of my teachers put paper over the window like the shooter is gonna see paper and be like oh yeah nobody in here"
"3120","Teacher: Sir shall we do a Shooting Drill unannounced ?

Principal: Jewet

Palpatine: That's my line...."
"3121","What if they have a hammer?"
"3122","UMMMM MY CLASS DON't shut up? So yea, and they say the walls are thin so they can hear us, I wonder if it's good to fart or sneeze by accident if this were real?"
"3123","1:31 look at the right"
"3124","Why does everyone like pumped up kicks? It sounds dumb as hell"
"3125","It's a good idea to make drills realistic because then if they think it's real they will actually listen"
"3126","I just like to throw stuff so great"
"3127","this happened at my school it was scary as hell"
"3128","I know a few students that if they saw their teacher trying to overpower an attacker they would jump in and help their teacher I know I would be one of the first on them because I like most of my teacher's because they just make learning fun"
"3129","My school only does practice lockdown 1 times a year"
"3130","*America*"
"3131","My school just turns off the lights, gets to one side of the room, locks the door, and the principal comes to check if the door is locked. Nothing realistic."
"3132","Why do teachers stuff them in the corner. That's how you get everyone shot and killed."
"3133","1:26 transgender"
"3134","LOL a woman could never take down a 200 pound man or even a shooter"
"3135","I only went through one lock down that was a drill in 2010 only drill we ever had, then one year later in 2011 we had a shooting that killed an assistant principle and critically injured our principle."
"3136","We dont have those drills. We never had. We only have em if they are real."
"3137","Sandy hook was funny."
"3138","If they announced it was a drill, why are the kids thinking it's real? That's more stupidity on the kids side to be honest. And in the event of a real shooting, you'd probably be glad to see the police coming in....not scared by it."
"3139","If there a shooting drill that i dont know ill always bring my nerf guns that are automatic XD JUST IN CASE THAT I SHOOT HIM IN THE BALLS OR EYE LOLOLOLOL"
"3140","Guys lets attack skyview Academy they arent prepared"
"3141","If there was a shooter you all shouldn't be in a corner together. its a dumb way to die. instead you should all be next to the door but in a way so the shooter doesn't see you and so when its the right time you can stop him with a pencil or hit him over the head with a chair to knock him out."
"3142","A *TRUE* drill story:
One day, my principal  (Imma call her Professor McGonagall)   was walking around the floor  my class room was on - with what? A tablet.
She pushed a button and there was *SUPPOSIVELY* extremely faint gun shot sounds.
The teacher asked a question and this child, we're in the same  class, and Imma call the kid Neville, since he's a total idiot in most subjects and he's a screw-up.
Now, when the teacher calls on Neville, Neville says that Professor  McGonagall was walking by the floor with the tablet making shooting  noises.
My teacher instantly shouts ""LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN!""
The class got free ice cream for calling lockdown."
"3143","0 deaths from fires 1,000 deaths from shooting




Thank you schools and state"
"3144","Our school had a bomb threat, some kid brought a gun, and a shotgun was found in a locker room. Each lockdown was at least 3 hours"
"3145","If only we had a device that could throw those balls at 1500 fps"
"3146","ever heard of the boy who cried wolf? when there's a real one some kid will not care and run out until he gets shot."
"3147","I really don't get the idea of the lockdown:
-Get in a corner or under your desk
Okay so the intruder would see the school supplies and books on the desk and know that people are there. you should at least be able to take your stuff with you so they don't know
-Lock the door
Have you every heard of chainsaws, crowbars, hammers, and other things?

And the intruder might have done that in the past and know what they're doing"
"3148","Que maricas jajajaja si todos se pueden hacer los héroes pueden morir 10 13 pero no toda una escuela"
"3149","If there's ever a real lockdown or drill grab a stapler and shoot at the guy"
"3150","Tbh don't go to schools that have school shooting drills

you might get shot."
"3151","yeah... more weapons = more safety"
"3152","let's be honest with kids nowadays being immature and stupid and a bunch of noisy idiots some of us are gonna die"
"3153","why can't every school have these drills I mean look at the world we live in we should atleast be prepared"
"3154","The shooter might spray 'n pray
So that would be a bad idea"
"3155","Otacos 64 ham and cheese"
"3156","only if its a ugly teacher"
"3157","now thats going ham"
"3158","Naw make everyone go naked, including the teacher, and the rape the shooter"
"3159","HoboJoe122 lol 😂 it must be either that the kids there are weak or that he's fat from eating Doritos and drinking mtn dew and being fat as fuck"
"3160","CallMeSwaq lol what a loser pathetic call me swag and shit and calling himself strong what fake shit is this"
"3161","TheRealSwaq The kid that's playing Roblox is actually physically fit? Surprising"
"3162","TheRealSwaq Wait your teacher is in a fucking wheelchair. I don't know what type of fucking school your in but the teachers are the one that suppose to be doing that. The principals consider the students safety a lot that they need to protected. If I do that I would get suspended. Unless your just a fucking child that's trying hard to get attention. Please kindly fuck off"
"3163","I don't think she likes us very much ._."
"3164","ThisIsMyRealName I would, too. I have a ground school, so I could jump out the window anytime I want"
"3165","You would break your ankles or just die. unless if you're lucky enough to live on the bottom classroom and have enough strength to break the window in time and run away with your phone or something"
"3166","Yeah cause you totally know when the intruder's gonna come and have tennis balls to throw"
"3167","im going to sh.... i mean nothing"
"3168","all the other kids"
"3169","One time my school had a drill and the principal banged on the door and said is anyone here and a kid yelled ""yea, in the corner"""
"3170","if my class and me was in a active shooter on the loose were all going to jail"
"3171","This really really bothers me. They're kids-- shocking them with bloody students playing dead in the hallway isn't making anyone safer not to mention being incredibly disrespectful to those that have actually died in a shooting. Bringing in cops and real guns isn't teaching anything. They're scaring the poor kids for no reason. This isn't a game or a skit. This is something serious that should be treated like it. I feel like these teachers don't know what they're doing.

If they want to keep these schools safe then do presentations on how and why to keep safe, how to stay calm, where to go, and what to be weary of based on past attacks. Not blood and guts shock tactics to scare them into line. Who's that saving? Can't kids go to school without being shown fake corpses and surprise drills sprung up on them? How traumatic."
"3172","I would convince people and say we would die if we stay here might as well die like cowards but we could try to take the gunman down"
"3173","But now what happens if there is a real shooter! They're gonna start not trusting them so what if hey just don't take it seriously"
"3174","stop rehearsing our deaths are you stupid rehearsing how to not die dumbass."
"3175","Please can someone explain to me the reference to pumped up kicks as I've seen it in so many comments."
"3176","My school is different than everybody else's because when you walk in the door and go left, you come to a rotary, and the 7th graders are on the left, and the 6th graders are on the right, and the eighth graders are in the middle. Each grade is separated into three teams (Wolfpack, tigers, yellow jackets for sixth, fighting irish, pirates and wildcats for seventh, and also wildcats, huskies and terriers for eighth) and their are two entrances to each grade's wing. The irish is right on the left and the wolfpack is right on the right next to the entrances to the rotary, so that means if i was in a regular class (i'm on 7th grade irish), if the bad person chose to go left, 7th grade would be in most danger. Also next to each classroom is a window about a meter tall and a yard wide. We were talking about lockdowns in math class one day, and even my math teacher knows the bad guy could be in our wing first because she said ""when we get called into a real lockdown we just do what we gotta do and hope that the intruder hasen't reached the wings yet"". They could also go to the UA wing but they probably won't find much. You can't see through the windows on the doors, and most of the teachers in the building have some sort of plan of defense and protection for us just in case. I talk to much but if you actually read this far thank you! 😊"
"3177","honestly are shool never tells us about the lock downs on purpose. But then  the teaches tell us anyways. Also my whole class would probably die cuz my whole class can't shut up"
"3178","damn ptsd is striking early this year"
"3179","If we did this at our school, I'd be there every time to watch!!!!!!!!"
"3180","teaching to know them the enemy is reloading that is too ovous"
"3181","enlist the football team what about the wresltiing team,?"
"3182","does this happen to anyones classes where they (students) dont take it series even if it was an actually real"
"3183","At my school, we had a lockdown. And my Gym Teacher made me run to the science room. Note that it at the other side of the school. There was some violent guy and I saw him. Then she sent like 20 other kids there. We were all so panicked."
"3184","we actually had a shooter in our school and this one kid ran out of my algebra class and snuck up on the shooter and snapped his arm. i dont know how the kid did it, but fuck me it was impressive."
"3185","i felt bad for the girl from clombine high school i almost cried"
"3186","oh sh#t these teachers are learning defense. we can't mess with them"
"3187","my geometry teacher told us if a shooting or something ever happens all the girls were going to be barricaded into the closet he has but only like 15 or so of us can fit so the other half apparently are used as sacrifice smh best believe i was always the first in the closet and all my other classes just be like turn the lights off and shut up"
"3188","tbh who would jump out the window to escape a shooter- this is for the people who want to jump out a window. Jumping out a window would physically harm you and probably get you stuck. It gives more stress to the teachers and parents to find you, get you (maybe) kidnapped, and get hit by a car if you're crossing the street because you arent thinking right from trauma. All you are thinking off when a shooting is happening is ""I need to get away"" Stay put in the place you were assinged and stay away from other students. Being spread out makes it hard for the shooter to shoot people. Unless you are in immediate danger, stay put. Be quiet unless you want to die and harm others. If you want to cry, cry, but cry softly. Dont let your emotions control you. have something to throw at the shooter at all times. If you need to go to the bathroom, do your business on a thick piece of tissue. Keep it just in case the shooter comes or you could pee near the door so the shooter would slip. Dont be embarassed. Know that you are saving lives. This should help you"

The police just come and knock on the door, and we try to hide and be quiet, that's it -_- it doesn't really teach us how to stay alive -_- and I was doing a lock down drill once, and my class was like, ""we should sit quietly in this corner cause if they come in throw the main door (there were 3 doors in my classroom ) the shooter will just look straight ahead or whatever and totally miss us. But the corner was in plain sight and there wasn't anything to hide under or behind. Wow my classmates are soooo smart they would've totally survived a real lock down -_- like what does the shooter not know how to look to the side of them? :/"

1. Flip most desks or tables on their sides
2. Make a Fort out of the flipped ones
3. use the others to barricade the door"

"3250","if there were kids only inside the classroom and they wont be scared to fight im sure that the guy\girl would fall down or something"
"3251","Let's see how this would work out...

"3266","The kid doesnt wanna admit to being scared as fuck"
"3267","Okay I get it, I just personally don't put so much energy into comments, which is why I reacted the way I did"

"3275","Dame Time truth"
"3276","A schoolshooter would likely go into a room full of screaming kids"
"3277","I'm pretty sure by the time they could shoot a hole big enough for them to go through, they'd run out of ammo."
"3278","Although it's shit, it better than nothing. They basically have schools made of paper. If a school shooter were to see a class, he would simply shoot through the walls. 

Also, he doesn't know how many people are the class. He doesn't know about the probabilities of him being taken down. The fear could make the shooter do something rash or even pussy out."
"3279","It's done that way because a shooter wants quick targets and does not have time to guess if there are potential victims in the room. Realistically, school shootings like this only last about 5-10 minutes before the police arrive."
"3280","Lmao its so obvious"
"3281","What happens when you run around the corner into the shooter? Running blindly is just as bad as hiding."

I had a teacher In 4th grade that kept a metal baseball bat behind his desk, and didn't tell us, until one day we had a real intruder. He snuck over there, grabbed that bat, and was ready to hurt anybody that came near us. Hands gown best teacher I ever had"
"3429","If this was in my school it would be all over snapchat ""sr, lockdown now"" 😂"
"3430","As soon as the drill goes I run straight for the teachers desk lie down and roll under so I'm completely hidden I'm not taking any chances"
"3431","I hate drills because this boy in my class yells GUYS THAT KID I BULLIED IS HERE TO FUCK US UP WE BETTA RUN and the quite kid whispers pumped up kicks in the corner"
"3432","I have an idea. Make sure the kids wear long sleeves and pants, then act it out with bb guns.

No, I'm not serious."
"3433","I know it sounds odd but teachers should go through gun lessons and should have a LOCKED spot in their desk with a glock 19"
"3434","Imagine if America weren't ignorant and just banned guns.."
"3435","all those people in the corner would be killed with maybe 2 or 3 shotgun shots"
"3436","😂😂😂😂all these kids are gonna die, I would bust one of those windows with a desk and dart"
"3437","There was a shooting at my school. He almost shot me in the frakin ballz!"
"3438","At our school we changed the way we do it: ADD (Avoid deny defend) basically first we would avoid (on announcements trachea said they will say where the person is and depending where the person is try to evacuate students on the opposite side of the school + send us into the woods. Secondly we deny (the the potential shooter is in our area of the school we would proceede to lock any doors, barricade them, and bungee them shut, and instead of hiding in the corner, we line up besides any doors so if the intruder manages to get in we can defend) then final stage is defend (if the intruder would to get in we have permission to though anything, tackle and do anything we can do defend ourselves.) Defending is optional though and you don't have to do this. When they first taught us this drill this is what the police chief + school officer told us: try to get his/her gun and when you get it putt it in a trash can (so police do t find you with the gun and think your the shooter). If you get the gun bring it in a trash can to police when they arrive. They also said to put your hands up and stand still when the police check the Classroom (they don't know who the shooter is and they don't want to mistake you as the shooter.... so they want to be able to see your hands and and don't want you to jump or anything [like you might attack]). The first time we practice it the entire school did avoid, and some classes did deny while other classes who VOLUNTEERED to go do defend. Basically the classes that did defend left the doors unlock for an payed actor to come In with nothing while they through grumbled paper at him. It was quite funny actually."
"3439","It would've been more Realistic if Pumped Up Kicks was playing"
"3440","Umm during lockdown drills my school does not take it to far they just put us in the cornered and turn lights out put blinds down and wait till the principal comes knock on our door and if that happen I'll be crying"
"3441","if there's a school shooting then don't hide in a fucking corner"
"3442","This look very scary I live in England so I don't know what it's like I wouldn't want to be there"
"3443","If a shooting happens ,I'll use my key(or if there is a knife) and kill the suspect or stab him/her in the back"
"3444","R.I.P Rachel joy scott have an amazing time in heaven.😇😣😢"
"3445",">School Shooting Drill
What a time to be alive."
"3446","Ban guns in America and shit like this isn't necessary."
"3447","3:50 yes because all teachers keep dozens of tennis balls in their room"
"3448","I wonder how many potential school shooters are watching this thinking, ""Oh hmm, good to know."""
"3449","I would've sobbed ._."
"3450","One of the FIFTH graders at my school brought in a gun, or so the bratty drama queens say... I say bullturd"
"3451","If this happens, you break apart scissors and use them as knives."
"3452","I don't think that's bad, it's to see what kids would really do"
"3453","okay but why don't they lock the doors"
"3454","we had 2 drills this week"
"3455","My school only did it only one time and, it wasn't a drill..."
"3456","MERICA"
"3457","*hides on the side away from the door* 

NOBODY WILL SEE US HERE!! 

This is what I yelled out in a drill and everyone stared laughing because seriously if they get in he can clearly see us"
"3458","Well maybe start drilling everyone, everywhere, for every possible bad situation."
"3459","All the other kids"
"3460","The sixth graders at my local middle school well all middle schoolers have lockers inside there classroom and my friends little brother could just hide in the lockers he would have no worries"
"3461","this happend and he came in and me and some other of my friends took him down and he shot me in my arm and i was like ahhhhhh but he went to jail"
"3462","wanna know how you can prevent yourself from being killed... 





throw tennis balls at him..."
"3463","I Remember In Kindergarten They Used To Say If You Don't See Them They Can't See You.... WTF Am I Supposed To Do In A Shooting Turn My Back To The Gun And Pray They Don't See Me!?!"
"3464","Damn, I remember back in 1999 in Columbine, I think it was April. We had a drill there, a few injuries but nothing major, it felt like it was real."
"3465","okay but, if they get used to the drills wont they just always think its real from now on"
"3466","130mph,, damn"
"3467","My school got a bomb threat two days ago"
"3468","If I was on the camera, I'd be in the background making the weirdest fucking faces."
"3469","know one locked the doors really smart school🤔😐😑🙃"
"3470","All my school does is a fire drill and we just go outside:/"
"3471","I would just pretend I'm dead so when the shooter leaves  I'm alive lmao"
"3472","we have a buzzer on our door so o cant get in unless the staff approves you too"
"3473","What if the shooter is carrying a gun AND a knife,if they tackle him like that,he can just reach his pocket and stab the one who tackled him,they should do a practice of tackling that defends both"
"3474","My school almost got shot up by a freshmen girl durring one of a rallys. The school knew about it the day before because people told them, but didn't do anything because everyone likes to joke around about the memes 😂. She got arested before 2nd rally though so yay?😂"
"3475","this is wild"
"3476","If there was a shooter I would protect my friends and teacher and I would try to scare the shooter by get my teachers phone and call 911 and before they come I will smack him with my water bottle"
"3477","them: may it save a life 
me: no"
"3478","i only ever had 1 lockdown drill"
"3479","lol when we have a drill, instead of staff coming over the speaker, there's an alarm that scares the crap outta my class"
"3480","3:48 aye-yo that's lit I wish my school did that with drills"
"3481","Once there was a lockdown and we were in the gym not classroom so we couldn't lock the door. We hind in the chageing room for boys and when the principal came by my teacher apologized and then we heard (most of the class) heard the principal say ""It's ok at lest you are fine that was not a drill"" it was SO Scary!"
"3482","I'd put my head to the gun tbh"
"3483","My school doesn't have drills so me and my friends made a plan of our own 😂"
"3484","if theres a school shooting and the teacher tells us to stay in the corner and wait, i say fuck that! Im goin out the window!"
"3485","We have open walls in our class room so we have to move BOOK SHELVES to block the entrance we also are tough to tackle and if needed attacked with all freedom (sharp items)"
"3486","At my school there is no fake shooter. We get in the corner of the class close the blinds and cover the window on the door. My teacher said to ""go to the computer cart throw all of the computers out and put it in front of the door"" and after we move the computer cart we move all the desks in front of the door too and there are teachers guarding ever classroom"
"3487","but for real tho I don't see a problem with this"
"3488","look guys it's easy... just be nice to the quiet white kid with the Skechers"
"3489","In our lockdown we push all the desks against the door to the wall so its un openable and then we hide"
"3490","This is so dumb it's sad you wouldn't have to practice a drill if you just banned guns"
"3491","One time at my old school they said we were having lockdown because of a shooter, they said it wasn't a drill. Then at the end they said ""wow everyone you did great in that drill"" there where kindergartners!!!! People where crying!!!!"
"3492","how to protect any school the english way1. get gates outside the school2.get a receptionthere you go ._."
"3493","why tf they showing what they do during a lockdown, now killers gonna know what teachers do with the students during a lockdown"
"3494","We had a school lock down and our teacher throw paper planes at us and we had it for1hour"
"3495","eyy, this video made me find kids better"
"3496","GOING OUT THE WINDOWS IS THE SAFEST WAY ACTUALLY."
"3497","Once I had a drill that lasted for like 40 minutes."
"3498","Why were they texting? the first rule we were taught was NEVER TEXT DURING A LOCK DOWN. Not only will it cause panic to the parents but it creates a crowd outside the school that can make the situation worst."
"3499","My school has EVERY DOOR THAT LEADS OUTSIDE LOCKED, and they also have 24/7 surveillance system. We dont have lots of money, but we use it for that. One time my friend and I went out side to empty out the recycling bin, and my hands got stuck in a hole on the bin, and had to call my friend to help me who was holding the door, she let go, and we were locked outside.😹 we had to run to the front office and ring the bell oml😹😹"
"3500","yeah lets just fucking sit behind a desk not gonna fucking find me hereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
"3501","Aiden Jackson why"
"3502","I see your refrence"
"3503","HAAHHA SAME"
"3504","For me it was not scary, but the entire class stood there trying to hold back laughter as the teacher was presenting to curl up in a ball and rock... it was funny, and our school did not give any of the actors any fake weapons, they had nothing (did to have anything that made sound either). They also said that you do not have to defend in any way if a real situation were to occur, but for anyone that wanted too it is an legal option. The only other thing they did was have a police officer try to open all doors + look inside and see if everybody is mostly out of sight/quiet. I do think that is not okay to do drills and not tell anybody that they are drills bc that is not fare to students and teachers who might think it is real. I like how our school did it because they took time to explain everything in an assembly since it was something knew (after school the filmed examples of everything with drama students and teachers). Then they gave us a weeks notice to when the drill was happening. To addition during the drill they said on the intercom that it was a drill."
"3505","I want try the tennis ball method"
"3506","I hope you guys, if I go to school with you, know that is you ever fucking cry or yell while a shooter is in the school...I guarantee you that I will knock you the fuck out. The killer may be outside but you're stuck with me in that room."
"3507","This is the absolute worst thing to tell kids to do. Sitting ducks. I tell my daughter to bust a window with a chair, clear the shards and get out. Better a broken leg than get shot. If more teachers were armed in the classroom with training and a CWP this wouldn't happen."
"3508","6:01 rape attemption"
"3509","After these self defense moves are shown people should think twice before they think to shoot up a school"
"3510","we do this at school(in the the UK tho) and it got acciedentally set off and the whole school was hiding for like 30 mins lol"
"3511","If it was real, people would just snapchat it😪"
"3512","seriously what the fuck america"
"3513","i'm in year 12 and we have never had a 'school shooting drill' i am so thankful for our gun laws here"
"3514","once when I was in 5th grade we hada lockdown it was real he came in and almost shot me lol"
"3515","A kid came to my school with a knife and killed two teachers but my whole class attacked him with chairs and books what a time to be alive 😔"
"3516","I remember once in an actual lockdown I was in my math class and the teacher made us all grab calculators and if someone came through the door we'd all throw our calculators at them. The principal happened to walk through the door."
"3517","the thing is, most school shootings are done by students, so of course the teachers would beat them"
"3518","To does he have to be white?"
"3519","When they don't approve of your username ""El Chapo"" on Kahoot
So you decide to Kashoot."
"3520","Our school lines us up on the wall while the teacher stands by the door (just in case he breaks the door window and stick the gun through) but our teachers love to remind us that the walls are super thin and if there was an actual shooting then the bullets would go straight through 😞 Also we have this thing where you have to put a green slip under the door if everyone's OK and a red slip under the door if someone is wounded. Even though that'll tell the shooter right then and there that there are people in the room."
"3521","My school has a lock then for under the door"
"3522","there was about to be a shooter at my school today he planned to shoot up the school and kill a kid who was talking crap they found the gun in his locker thankfully . Glad they found the gun like why would you try to shoot yo the school for no reason and try to kill someone for talking crap like fight instead of trying to shoot up the school and the kid for no reason , i knew the guy who tried to shoot up my school it was my friends boyfriend"
"3523","In the beginning of the video that is the guy from live PD"
"3524","My school does that, just not as intense at ALL"
"3525","Please explain to me y they threw balls at the shooter? Im kinda thinking it was to startle him..."
"3526","only in america"
"3527","Welcome to America"
"3528","I would LOVE to throw a dictionary, Or  a chair at someone during a drill."
"3529","Have anyone been inside a bathroom when a lockdown drill what if you had to take a bad shit."
"3530","HOLY FUQ DA FRICK, MY FRIEND ENDED UP SUICIDING  AFTER A REAL SCHOOL LOCKDOWN {that scared her so bad} THAT ENDED UP BEING AN ACCIDENT LOCKDOWN, THIS SCHOOL IS FUCKED UP! Also we will always remember you felisha <3!!!"
"3531","*Hear gunshots and screaming*

All of a sudden a noise starts to get closer and closer to you

""ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS!"""
"3532","all of this stupid ""Training"" teaching kids to throw tennis balls and pencils at a shooter to ""slow him down"" right....just have armed security at schools. it's that simple. in israel, every school has multiple armed IDF soldiers. when was the last school shooting in israel? and israel has radical muslims throughout their country trying to kill people every day"
"3533","kids shouldn't have to get used to hiding under desks"
"3534","OK the ""fighting back"" training is fucking stupid and dangerous. 
A real school shooter would NOT be stopped by two women and some tennis balls.
Not only that, now that these drills are public knowledge school shooters will be wary of this shit and will take precautions. 
Also all of these precautions would be useless if some demented rich college kid bought a mini gun and heavy armour."
"3535","6:17 meanwhile the teacher trying to take the gun from the shooter and both are rolling around the shooter is firing bullets shooting and injuring the other kids in the room"
"3536","It's sad that we have to have drills like this now."
"3537","2:29 is that Donald Trump ??"
"3538","The police aren't that mean or bad"
"3539","Problem is that at any point the gun man could reach for a knife."
"3540","I say that instead of teaching self defense just give a MP5 or a shotgun to all the teachers and train them with it..."
"3541","what about a automatic gun?"
"3542","This is what all schools needs to do"
"3543","They boys in my class say that if a shooter would come into our room, they would fight back. They even get their scissors and rulers during a lockdown drill. But in reality, they would probably be acting like scared babies!"
"3544","i felt horrified seeing all those kids throwing balls and laughing while someone walks in with a gun, that is not what would really happen and they need to stop treating it like a joke, every classroom should have a door installed to take them directly outside , a one way door so they can escape instead of hiding in a corner"
"3545","LOL look at the girl waving at camera 1:30"
"3546","Now shooters now exactly where everyone will be. Just saying, look at it from the shooters perspective you fools, that's what they want, everyone stil and in the same place so that can kill as many as they can."
"3547","Plan failed School shooter know the tactics time for plan b RUN"
"3548","If your a parent don't rush to the school, if its the real thing you could be shot and the police will have more to deal with just stay at home and tell your child to turn off their phone."
"3549","This would be fun!"
"3550","glad I don't live in a third world country and don't have to worry about this :)"
"3551","Yeah.... just hide in a corner like little sheeplets about to get slaughtered, instead of just hiring some armed guards or maybe even training the teachers. God people are so stupid. If someone walks into your classroom with a gun, you either fight or die. Heartbreaking to know that they won't allow to have USEFUL means for defending themselves."
"3552","Only in the USA"
"3553","were required to throw scissors and sharp items if they get in the room."
"3554","They forgot to put pumped up kicks on the com"
"3555","In my anatomy class, my teacher said if there's a shooter in the building we can use equipment as weapons. She even had each of us pick out what we would grab to fight with so when it happened, we would be fast and efficient. (I picked my desk) Lol. She was a beast, I miss her//"
"3556","all the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run better run"
"3557","During this drill I was in band and some kids hid in the storage room and everyone was laughing and screaming and than some instruments had dropped than😂😂in the practice rooms some ppl decided to argue and yea it was a mess. And this happened twice 

Don't get me started on the fire drills😂😂😂that happens during band"
"3558","School: Lockdown, Lockdown

School Shooter: Aw damnit, they are not here."
"3559","You ask any kid at my school and they will tell you they want a school shooter"
"3560","You know your country if fucked when you have to do this."
"3561","Just asking what if you get sent outside of class and this happened"
"3562","I want to do the training."
"3563","Actually the best thing to do is spread the kids out if you come in you can shoot more kids if they are in one spot but if they are spread out at least fewer kids get shot and the teacher has more time to stab them with scissors or something"
"3564","Fuck me, they talk about these kids being innocent, one of the reasons these shootings happen is that these fucking kids bully the shit out of them for days, it's their own fault"
"3565","DURING A Drill my friend was under something and it would of might of fell on his head and he said THIS THING WILL FALL ON MY HEAD"
"3566","One time in a lockdown drill in my school, we were in gym, so we had to stay in a cramped gym storage room and it got hot RAYL QWIK because there were 40 kids in a 1.5 square meter room"
"3567","I'd probably star fish myself out the window but, if gun men/women by the window then I'm gonna take them with me ._."
"3568","2:29 DONALD TRUMP IS THAT YOU"
"3569","omg that is my school"
"3570","Oh no you're scaring the kids. Sometimes you need to scare them in order to prepare them for what might happen."
"3571","How not to die: Get trump and the swat team or get someone dressed like trump and say lets build the wall here pointing at his private and get a worker to say""LETS START WITH A NAIL *grabs a huge katana and desk"" NOW BBbBhBSHBVHDJKDMDNFJSODBDJHFJDHGJ"
"3572","i touch myself to this"
"3573","This is why you should be friends with bullied people, so you won't get shot"
"3574","5:55 if this was real this bitch would be in a choke"
"3575","I think that schools should always say when it's not a real shooting. Some kids are stupid enough to be ""funny"" and yell loudly during drills. If they think that it's just a drill, they could give everyone away"
"3576","Why would u sit in a corner waiting for them to break the door open"
"3577","You play pumped up kicks over the intercom , that's how you prepare"
"3578","Well, this is when you know your country is fucked"
"3579","Instead of hiding behind the teacher's desk,why don't the students push it against the DOOR?
Retards"
"3580","Or just ban guns? (cue Americans justifying gun ownership and the unnecessary deaths of thousands of people)"
"3581","Teachers need to keep revolvers in there dedk"
"3582","Fun until you see the reality"
"3583","my school never went to a chooting drill :)"
"3584","Instead of sensible gun laws which the overwhelming majority of Americans approve of, we go through all of this shit, which gives some kids acute PTSD. Especially if you already grew up with violence in the house."
"3585","onetime, there was actually a real lockdown. but, there was still people who talked and made noises. fortunately,  the reason was that just some shady guy was hanging out on the campus."
"3586","those drills are a lot better than just huddling all together, and I know because I am one of those students that need to do the drills. But luckily we have changed to the alice drills,  which is when we lock the doers, tye a rope to the doer, and throw objects if the threat manages to get in. Also we have established that if the threat is on the other side of the school we get out and run away to a safe house and hide there."
"3587","MUUUURICAAA"
"3588","don't do it...... jewett"
"3589","Is it bad that my school went in lockdown for 2 hours and I got in trouble for laughing too much?"
"3590","This is why there was two gunmen during columbine so one can protect during the other one while he's reloading"
"3591","My school did it right, we barricade the door with anything we can find (and even throw desks at the doors, or escape if we have the ability) and if somehow the shooter got in we could basically all just maul them, and the chemist teachers would mix together explosives or even high acidic level chemicals to burn the shooter."
"3592","i would call the police"
"3593","First off the woman whose husband raced to the school + the kids that texted their parents were really in the wrong. The whole point is to not be on your phones and therefore free up the lines."
"3594","I currently go to this school, 7th grade as well. The drills we do now is just lights off, doors locked and the principal and other staff looking in the windows. Even though we're supposed to be quiet, a lot of kids laugh and joke."
"3595","but what if the shooter plays csgo and checks corners"
"3596","I'm in middle school at the moment and I was in 5th grade and we had a lockdown drill, when the custodian/officer(don't remember which) came to open the door he didn't say that the drill was over as opening it like he is supposed to so my teacher grabbed a chair and threw it at him."
"3597","In britain we only have fire drills cos we dont have shootings as you are not aloud guns in the uk"
"3598","I had a lockdown once...There was somrone eho jumped the fence with a gun...My therapist was in thr back with another student :( shes safe... I cried when I saw my brother and my mom and all my friends..."
"3599","Damn, why don't schools have K-9s???"
"3600","So it's always the men that shoot the schools down 😶 I don't see anyone trying to take down a women that could be a shooter..."
"3601","every time we have a lockdown it's always the females that screw us over they cry and talk and text and crap."
"3602","smh my school barely have one a year so if there was ever a shooting we'd probably all die and it would be the principals fault"
"3603","roses are red
violets are blue 
when the alarm dropped 
the kids did too"
"3604","why the hell would u sit and wait to be shot"
"3605","Nightcore Official that's sad"
"3606","I'm so sorry to hear"
"3607","ha jk"
"3608","Jewett Academy*"
"3609","fuck that im running"
"3610","dood you could get ptsd from this even if it's fake."
"3611","Am i a bad person for humming ""Pumped Up Kicked""??"
"3612","yeah like hiding behind the desk can save oh god!"
"3613","It's impossible for a shooting to happen in a school because it's a gun free zone"
"3614","cant the kids just get sharp sissors and thr teacher get a knife in their class room instead of hiding?Only blind shooters wont notice them hiding under a small desk."
"3615","Please, do not hide! If the intruder is near your room, barricade and prepare to counter if they get in! If the shooter isn't near your classroom, escape! If you sit and hide, you are literally a sitting duck!"
"3616","I just did a lockdown drill. Geez, at least we don't have to be tramitised"
"3617","gernades work"
"3618","1:00"
"3619","1:6"
"3620","That teacher fighting that fake shooter was lit af"
"3621","dont they lock the doors cause in mine the teacher was in another side of the library and these 2 kids kissed in 3 grade"
"3622","Personally i think jewett middle school had it right we as kids in schools dont have many lockdown drills and even if its a bb gun weapon i think it scares them and teaches them what could happen and what they need to do."
"3623","And this is why I always keep a Balisong in my pocket everyday at school"
"3624","That's why I always bring my trusty brick to school"
"3625","We had a 20 minute drill XD"
"3626","If we had school lockdown drills in Wales and it happened in my school my class would be the first class down cause we can't shut up and some idiot would be playing 'pumped up kids'"
"3627","its sad to life in a country where you have to take courses on how to react when someone tries to kill you in a building of education"
"3628","This is scary for me when I go to middle school I don't want this to happen what if I go to the bathroom and the bell rang and all the doors are locked and they did not let me in I would be scared and cry and they would shoot me"
"3629","IM STILL SAD OF SANDY HOOK"
"3630","What's even freakier is we had a bomb threat last year so they set off the fire alarm, the lockdown alarm and the tornado alarm all at once and everyone was running everywhere screaming bloody murder and eventually we went ten feet across the road between the school building and the Community Learning Center and went in the gym inside the wall parallel with the road. That made us feel a whole lot better. *notice sarcasm* Let's face the cold hard truth here. If any kind of violent shit happens at your school there's a good chance you're fucked and the teachers aren't going to do much about it."
"3631","The problem with the way she's grabbing the gun at 6:14 is that her hand is over the damn action so if he pulls that trigger her fingers and part of her palm are gone, and then she's gonna be too busy screaming and whining in pain to continue trying to subdue him."
"3632","In my social studies class, my teacher was like ""I have a metal bat behind a desk by the notebooks"" we were all like *raises hand* ""But but..we have scissors.."" ""Well I like my metal bat"""
"3633","How to survive...
1. If you can, push desks against the door if it is a push door, if not don't do
2. Make sure everyone has either a stapler, scissors, or a object to throw or use as a defense incase
3. Have someone or yourself stand at the door with either a chair or Fire extinguisher.
4. If they enter the room, beat the living crap out of them with the chair, or hit them in the head with the fire extinguisher until they pass out or are severely hurt, then spray them with the extinguisher and keep hitting them.If they are fighting back have someone get scissors and pretend they offended your dead dog. (stapler works too)"
"3634","Bro why practice these drills when you could just exo punch or exo slam the shooter"
"3635","How did I get from 47 Meters Deep to this!?!?!?"
"3636","In my school 1:57 it shows it. In a fire (a real fire) instead of following the rules, ( a single file line., walking)
I'D BE RUNNING THE HECK OUTTA THAT PLACE AND FREAKING LIVE"
"3637","at my school school shooter drills are just when the principal says over the intercom that theres a school shooter and then we get away from the windows and sit on the floor and talk and go on our phones for like 10 minutes then its over. ive never had a serious school shooter drill"
"3638","I have NEVER had a drill this intense in all my years of school (I'm about to go into 7th) and this would be extremely traumatic to many students. All we have ever done is had an officer come and knock hard on the door as if trying to break in."
"3639","How come my school never practices shooting drills we only do fire drills! I'm going to die :("
"3640","Why did that stupid bitch teacher cry"
"3641","I only had ONE school shooting drill EVER, its stupid that my elementary school only had one EVER in my 5th grade class. was so curious how the teachers would ACTUALLY act in this situation. and this is amazing. but our drills only had the teachers and students behind the damn desk WHICH YOU COULD SEE UNDER!!!!!! these drills should be performed at EVERY SCOOL!!! there should be a special day that 1st through 3rd should be out of school and police informs fourth and fifth graders what to do, because in middle schools this is where it usually happens the most and elementary graders should be prepared what to do. I do homeschool because a kid in fifth grade slammed my head into the corner of a wall and broke my left adult front tooth in half which was in 2016, this is how violent kids are these days people. Im in sixth now and am happy I can avoid this doing home school. I pray this never happens and no lives are stolen by depressed kids."
"3642","aahh i tought this is gonna teach me how to shoot up a school damn it!"
"3643","I would use school scissors"
"3644","we dont even have this, we dont need this because no one here has a frigging gun except police"
"3645","THIS IS FUCKING CRAZY!!!! NO this is not ok. my son is 11 and he is constantly fighting up for someone getting bullied. i dont need my son thinking he can take a gun even with thousands of hours of training. school need trained professionals in schools. ex military,ex cops, anyone but kids or teachers."
"3646","police state"
"3647","Imagine being in the restroom taking a #2 and out of nowhere you hear gun shots......"
"3648","GOD! WHY ARE THERE SO MUCH GUNS THERE KIDS OK"
"3649","man just don't flame the wierd kids new balances"
"3650","Lmao when we did this in school for lockdowns,we would all huddle together and be loud as fuck,no way these kids were that quiet lmao"
"3651","this is wrong"
"3652","During a drill a kid started talking and like he almost made us get heard"
"3653","My school literally just does fire drills and they barely do them there are 20 days left of school and we only had one fire drill"
"3654","What evil person made a video"
"3655","That's fun not scary"
"3656","I keep lock downs in 3 ways 


Code yellow : if a animal is on campus close doors and teaching continues 

Code red : normal lock down 

Code black : this is the worst kind of lock down this is if a man kills , shoots , a gun on school ground"
"3657","Nice ""land of the free"" shit you got there America. ;)"
"3658","im from indonesia and i've never had any of these kinds of drills and stuff so im like ""man,if this happened in my school i'd be scared af"""
"3659","3:50 when the teacher comes in"
"3660","If that happened to me I would have gotten my scissors and I have raced to that shooter I don't care if I get in trouble i would go right to the eye or throat  and I would save the day for once"
"3661","3:51 women thinking they can run the world again but in reality couldn't do shit"
"3662","almost got a ticket man that woman has some real priorities"
"3663","At my school we don't do that..."
"3664","in my school we dont hide we stand stay quiet and do work or chill but we never fight someone with a gun"
"3665","p u m p e d u p k i c k s"
"3666","Being given as many options are always best.  

Run, Hide, Fight.  Not just in schools but even at other places like malls and any ""soft targets"" aka criminal protection zones aka ""gun-free zones""."
"3667","Another way to prevent shootings.... no guns"
"3668","Sometimes a lockdown is kinda cost just almost cuddling in the dark. I held hands with my crus in a lockdown"
"3669","my school NEVER tells us if it's a drill or not. They just say to lockdown but never say anything else"
"3670","at my school when you shut the doors they automatically lock. and there's usually always paper covering up the windows on the doors."
"3671","Within 6:14 I would have kicked his bloody nose off"
"3672","my classes are usually in the 2nd floor the window is an easy exit the fall is like 4ft cushioned by bushes."
"3673","USA is fcked XDD"
"3674","One time in 7th grade my school had a lock down during last period. We expected it to be a drill all until shadows passed by our windows and footsteps were heard. I started to panic a little, but I started crying once my teacher and some boys were barricading the door with tables and chairs. 


Turns out,



There was no threat.







It was actually just a stupid construction worker who didn't sign into the school and had to use the bathroom."
"3675","If all of them do a drill the shooter will know were they are"
"3676","I always wanted to wait by the door and jump on them like the teachers did.So of we ever have a shooter drill are real I'll play pumped up kicks and then wait by the door and Rasengan his ass with my fist"
"3677","all the other kids and the pumped up kicks you better run better run, outrun my gun."
"3678","There was supposedly an active shooter in my school, I barricaded the door and broke off a chair leg to use as a weapon. I got everyone into a corner and told them to keep quiet. Let's just say that I'm respected now."
"3679","These drills just help thise who plan on a shooting. And causes horror and trauma for no real threat."
"3680","3:51 whoops! wrong person!"
"3681","the longest lockdown i had was a hour and it was real but a shooter wanst in the school thank goodness"
"3682","my middle school goes up to the doors and slammes on the doors and yell"
"3683","All school shooters are white...."
"3684","This makes me want to be a teacher.
Fighting those shooters and.

"3685","The longest drill I've ever had was probably two hours"
"3686","I don't think the whole class in one corner trying to hide isn't going to help"
"3687","If someone would try to attack my friends/loved ones, (I'm kinda the She-Devil when it comes to this) I would go Hulk."
"3688","Fuck that I'm running out the building"
"3689","one time my school had a lockdown and i was in the bathroom and was about to wash my hands and i thought it was a real drill so i hid in the bathroom stall with my feet on top of the toilet seat and held my breath and i was crying so much"
"3690","I'm 7years old and I have lock down drills sometimes now I'm watching this I HATE lock down drills if a shooter goes in  I'm throwing a chair at him  and stomp on his face"
"3691","well you know how fire drills work well one kid pulled the drill during gym and I kid you not people were jumping over people running and screaming no matter how many times we did drills kids were still stepped on and yes I was trampled over"
"3692","Fuck hiding. If a kid was shooting at my school I'm grabbing a pair of scissors and fighting. If Ima die Ima die in a fight"
"3693","if There was a shooting I would go fucking sonic speed out to my home.."
"3694","holy shit he almost got a ticket, Jesus Christ"
"3695","I would be the one dumbass that's late and pop the shit out of him"

"3705","How about instead of teaching kids what to do during a School Shooting, we teach kids about how bad violence is?"
"3706","my friend was in that damn drill. fuck those techers."
"3707","At 1:52 the school was from the Methuen Public Schools district. The Donald P. Timony School"
"3708","In my opinion kids shouldn't have to ""get used to it """
"3709","I'd hide under a box like Naked Snake"

"3724","i had a 2 hour lockdown because a gas station across the street from my school had gotten robbed at gun point and ran across my school yards"
"3725","If I ever shot up my school, I would play pumped kicks."
"3726","Whats it for? 
""for safety or something"" 
Great fucking drill if they dont even know what its for!"
"3727","I would've been terrified"
"3728","jk"
"3729","soon"
"3730","you know what's retarded, hiding under a desk for protection, I mean, doesn't that make you an easy target? Look at the columbine shooting, most victims where hiding under library tables. Why not just barricade the door? Who the fuck came up with that idea in the first place? 








Probably the same people that though hiding under you desk at school will save you from a Soviet nuclear strike. God bless USA"
"3731","imagine if two people just happened to go on a shooting spree in a school one day and they both didn't know each other. if one guy shoots the other guy is he a hero"
"3732","At my school all were told to do is turn off the lights sit in a corner and close the door, how's that gonna help?
Shooter: Oh it's 11am on a Tuesday, the parking lots full, but the door is closed. Guess it's empty."
"3733","Lucky, I would KILL for a school shooter at mine."
"3734","Just kick his nuts and disarm that bitch"
"3735","uhm won't future shooters learn these drills??"
"3736","What's The point of hiding in a corner it would just give a real shooter a bunch of free targets to shoot it?"
"3737","When I was in 3rd Grade, I had a lockdown that was apparently real. They said it was a drill, but they probably just said that to comfort kids that young. But we hid under our tables for more than half an hour. One of my classmates said they saw figures walking down the stairs that didn't look like staff. It creeped me out, but at least it wasn't dangerous.

The middle schoolers (my school is an elementary/middle school) found out the story of the lockdown. Basically, a parent left their baby in the building somehow. And they came back to look for him. But, the staff thought she was an intruder, so they locked down the school for half an hour."
"3738","teachers learn drop seoi nage"
"3739","All we get told is to throw chairs, scissors and pencils and hope we don't die:)"
"3740","Well if rather die a hero rather than a pussy :)"
"3741","If I where allowed to carry a Luger for self defense this wouldn't be an issue."
"3742","Naw son I got classes to be passing ain't nobody got time to worry about no shooter."
"3743","it wont help if theres 20 kids tyring to huddle inside a desk made for 1 person. they would obviously all get shot"
"3744","they have the right idea, I'd rather be predator than prey. I'd feel better having a plan to fight back, rather than hiding in the corner. they're not idiots, they know we're hiding."
"3745","Well from my past 5th grade the school was in lockdown i jumped the fuck out the window with 3 of my best friends we were fucking idiots to look at the central quadrangle we saw 5 men 1 of my friends said hey can you fuck off it was ok since they were only armed with melee stuff and then we ran out of school while we were running john said try to catch us fuckers oh and not bullshitting"
"3746","If there were ever a school shooting where I am at, the minute i hear a bullet, im breaking the window and i'm running"
"3747","I have not Ben in a schoolnlockdown"
"3748","Boi do you think the shooter is gonna go ""Oh, the students aren't for some reason on this ordinary weekday because the doors are locked""
If anything, you should be worried about the shooter setting off the fire alarm to bait the school"
"3749","We had a lockdown on earlier this week and people WOULDN'T STOP TALKING. I'm thinking ""Stop talking. Would you talk if the intruder was in the building?"""
"3750","Nobody in my schooling ever took drills seriously, not even the teachers. When the principal would come over the PA system and say we were going to leave for the evacuation drill Everyone groaned and didn't care. fire drills were annoying and just screwed up everyone's schedule for the day. The shooting drills weren't much, just sit in the corner for ten or fifteen minutes then back to work. If anything had ever happened at my school we all probably would have died."
"3751","isn't the news guy from Live PD?"
"3752",": ""Here's an idea!  Homeschooling and, save on taxes!  This way we kill two birds, with one stone.  No gun!!!""    xoxo     :O)"
"3753","it wont work! just sayin"
"3754","""It's just a drill bro"""

"3759","Columbine shooting was bad"
"3760","I am a random Internet guy and I approve this message 

ALOT!!!!!"
"3761","If I heard gun shots or anything like the anauncement goes on and says it's real I would be out of the door before u could say 1 2 3 and run as fast as possible home"
"3762","Plot twist: it's the teacher"
"3763","they should try to get out the building"
"3764","I love how kids have to hide all in one spot so that school shooters can shoot them easily, Logic. At least some people throw stuff at least."
"3765","Holly seems like such a nice person its so sad she had to go through something so terrible so young :C"
"3766","For our lockdown drills we just lock the doors, turn the lights off, close the blinds, and sit in a corner away from the door. Once a year we have the K9 Unit come. No simulated shooters lmao"
"3767","hmmm.... how do we teach kids about dangerous gunmen?....
.. aha!! we traumatize them!!!"
"3768","how the fuck sittin in a corner gonna be a good idea in a school shootin were you gonna run if they get in you in a goddamned line for em at that point"
"3769","Yeah so they teach the kids to hide behind their desks instead of teaching them how to run like usain bolt outa that bitch"
"3770","So one time, during a drill, the principal said it wasnt even though it was just to test us. In my classroom, some kids were talking loudly and snickering and making fart noises. If that had been a real lockdown, we may have died because of them."
"3771","I hope Eric and Dillon come back to test this place...xD"
"3772","Arm the teachers"
"3773","KICK HIM IN THE BALLS!!!! KICK EM!"
"3774","Dame in Tampa Florida"
"3775","Good to know."
"3776","This is the most dumbest shit i`ve ever seen, if a school shooting happened they would all be dead, oh yeah lets all go lay down in the corner were its easy to get shot you might as well tell the kids to line up on a wall then turn and face it and stay there fucking retard teachers."
"3777","""How do you train students and teachers to prepare for a school shooter"". Wellllllllll you tell them they need to run out of the building. And if they can't. Wait till the shooter comes in if they can. Then fuck them up with everything you can that's heavy"
"3778","story:

when I was in primary, our school had a simple lockdown that now that I think of, is pretty useless. we would usually hide, turn the blinds and lights down, and lock the doors. 

the evacuation was stupid too. we would run outside calmly and line up in classes, counting all of the class and taking roll call.

I remember one certain drill that failed to act quick enough. It was a mistake actually.

They never told us what time or day that the drill was going to take place. They just did it suddenly and didn't tell us. So inevitably, we all panicked. The teacher soothed us and said it was a drill.

The lockdown bell rang which is a screech that goes three times. (Screech, stop, repeat x3)

Then, because they hadn't planned it, the evacuation bell rang.

The thought that this could've been a real evacuation or lockdown and the bell failed to ring properly was horrifying.

What if there was a lockdown and a stranger was in the school grounds but suddenly the evacuation bell rings and we walk out into his/her clutches? What if there's a fire and the evacuation bell rings, but then the lockdown bel, rings and we burn to death?

Basically they didn't plan this at all and the teachers were frustrated and asking why it rang twice with different bells."
"3779","I love how the school shooter drills are just hide in a corner, that's literally not going to do anything except make it easier to hit everyone easier"
"3780","In my school, we had about 10 fire drills in one fortnight. All because some idiot decided to use deodorant in the toilets"
"3781","Real fucking good that would do siting in a corner he comes into the room and he has a Moab from the 30 kill streak cause of hiding in a corner"
"3782","the lady us like this I'd a drill... my school it's like BEEEP BEEEP BEEEP...LOCKDOWN KIDS SURVIVE"
"3783","The shooters here? Oh let's just turn of the light, hide behind the desk and be quite. Of course the shooters are dumb so no worries."
"3784","My preparation is easier. Homeschool"
"3785","locking the doors ain't gonna stop a person with a damn gun from getting in the class room its gonna be a 50/50 chance of liveing or dieing i hate to say it but its true who agree"
"3786","If I heard a gunshot in my school I would jump out of the window to escape."
"3787","Play pumped up kicks"
"3788","I would loved to get pounded by all of those teachers."
"3789","So basically the plan is stick your head in your ass and pray they dont feel like killing you? I wonder why all mass shootings happen in gun free zones..."
"3790","Let's be real here

Most ppl would hide and cover but in reality(I wouldn't hide) I would actually fight the gun man unless it's point blank shooting range then I'm either gonna hide behind a dick head or break a window quickly and throw a shard shard of glass as quickly as I can


What fighting skills u guys have? I got chinease martial arts and taikondow (dunno how to spell)"
"3791","Why aren't the doors locked? What's the point in turning the lights off and sitting in the corner if you're not going to lock the door? My teacher always locks the door"
"3792","If I heard screaming and a gunshot, I would be outta that school so fast I would make your head turn."
"3793","That Holly Carpender looks like Shailene Woodley..."
"3794","What if you shot a school shooter with your own gun?"
"3795","That teacher looked like an orphan black clone"
"3796","a ticket OH NO NOT A TICKET  what will i ever do 

bich plzz"
"3797","who shoots up a school with a pistol lmao"
"3798","I would hide behind the door and disarm him and turn the gun on him. Not hide in a corner and do nothing like a bitch"
"3799","Oh a shooters coming let's all stay in our classrooms and get picked off class by class."
"3800","Ha-ha, ""the school apologized to parents"". Lol, ffs."
"3801","we are told to be ready to fight if a shooter comes through a door in my school"
"3802","4:51 I stoped on the wrong time pause on 4:51"
"3803","I'm thinking of myself in elementary...if it was a drill that was realistic...I would have cried out of fear quietly."
"3804","Always that one kid who makes loud noises during lockdowns who you know for a fact is going to get you killed... *btw why literally WAIT for the shooter to come to you when u could jump out a window or go outside and hide behind something* boi just run for ur life"
"3805","At my school lock down drills are just locking the door, hiding in the back of a class and turning off the lights. Someone comes by and knocks at the door and that's it. Probably because I live in Canada."
"3806","There not gonna get scared if they know it's a drill make it real don't say anything and make fake gun shots"
"3807","We hold drills, but they just kind of shake the doorknobs. The majority of us are just on our phones or the school computers."
"3808","that would be scary!!!!"
"3809","Unannounced shooting drills sounds pretty fucked up. That has got to be traumatic for the kids, especially the small ones. enough of those and we have kids with PTSD without even witnessing a real shooting"
"3810","only usa things"
"3811","that moment when the school shooter spares the teacher and you have class tommorow"
"3812","how did I get here from watching what's on my iPhone videos!?"
"3813","If i ever heard gunshots im out, ill take the nearest exit"
"3814","if a school shooter told everyone to stand up, I'd be the only one


death lol"
"3815","At my school there was a drill and some kid starting moaning and slapping his leg .. he got sent outside lmao"
"3816","Once we had an active shooter in the area of my small town middle school I swear we were in lockdown for 3 hours."
"3817","3:48 I laughed when balls were thrown at him"
"3818","It's ok to be scared"
"3819","You know none of these people would do these things in a real shooting"
"3820","I would take a chair and break the window and jump off"
"3821","lmao this is on my mind every single day"
"3822","+Newt Scamander lmaooo"
"3823","lkr"
"3824","Panda Deadpool We hide in the corner, and my teacher stays at the door. She said if the shooter walks in, she will shove shaving cream in the gun. She has like five cans of it."
"3825","But now that I think about it, if a school shooter was one of the students, they would know the doors are just locked and break in through the door windows?? Makes sense."
"3826","And the teachers would hide in a fucking corner too, not doing anything. Partially because most of them are fat as fuck"
"3827","paste.l wrapmonster if that drill was real than your comment wouldve not existed :("
"3828","3:57 I'm so happy I saw this what is hiding gonna do he knows your there might as well fight"
"3829","Fun fact: We have ten seconds In my school to be prepared for a lock down"
"3830","during drills at my school we would have to lock the door close the blind pile up the desks at the door and move the  darn book case to keep the desks from moving and grab dictionaries or anything else to defend ourself 😂 atleast in our social studies class we would"
"3831","We never do any school shooter drills and I live in Texas"
"3832","This is kinda ridiculous. This is not what will prevent school shootings.
Instead of things like that our schools need mroe psychological checks and help for children who show suspicious behavior. Most of the school shooters of the past were in therapy for mental problems and had a fascination/hobby for shooting guns. Is it really that difficult to have some talks/checks with kids like that?
We need PREVENTION, not this!"
"3833","If a school shooter comes i join them"
"3834","S T R A Y   B U L L E T

"3835","Point blank period. If the door opens to your classroom you are dead anyway. Might as well fight back"
"3836","I tell every class I'm in y'all better help me fight this damn shooter cuz if I die trying to fight by myself I'm haunting everybody"
"3837","I'm sorry but I couldn't help when the fake gunmen yelled ""YOU'RE ALL DEAD! NEXT!"""
"3838","We had a lock down in my advisory and we had to be shoved in with a bunch of sixth graders from the drama class right next to us because we shared a hallway and they wouldn't shut the fuck up. When we told them to be quiet they started fucking yelling ghetto af and laughing until the door handle started to move.

*THEN THEY ALL STARTED TO FUCKING CRY LOUD AF*

"
"3839","If there was a shooting shit I would be out of their like *BOOM BAM POW BITCH*  but it always happens at my school but I can't go any where 😂 (1 year at Straw berry mansion)  & I can't bring shit I have metal detectors & officers 😂 on like every floor...I don't go there anymore tho"
"3840","I FULLY support this!"
"3841","How mine goes down: lockdown lockdown this is only a drill. Students: pffffffff. Everyone goes to the corner and starts doing fart noises. Teacher: STOP IT NOW. Students: but why do you get to talk. ""Attention the drill is over the drill is over you may continue class."
"3842","I hate how somebody can take children's lives in cold blood. I hate that these drills have become normal for us."
"3843","if i was a teacher i would silently send the kids out the window"
"3844","husband nearly got a ticket hahaha wow; better than your child gettin shot? maybe"
"3845","I have this child in my class who has a problem and she won't shut up smh"
"3846","Mom: go to school

Me: I could be dead you should be happy"
"3847","I always hated those kids who used to laugh all the time whenever we had a lockdown drill."
"3848","When I was in 3rd grade we had a real lock down and we were out at recess when the thing went off. All we saw was our OLD teachers running down the hall way trying to get us in the classroom. Kids were crying and scared it was a scary moment."
"3849","this happened at my school and it was sOOOO FUCKING FUN EVERYONE THOUOGHT IT WAS REAL but u know, things like that dont happen in my life im too normal so i decided it was not real i was still careful tho and it was suuppeeerrr fucking fun"
"3850","What does putting the clip on the shades do to hold it down?"
"3851","How ironic, this was recommended to me on April 20th (the same day that the collumbine school shooting happened)"
"3852","lol fucking america"
"3853","do schools do that in america"
"3854","At my school if there is ever a lock down we have to turn off our phones because they said it could possibly set off a bomb. Like what if that's the last way some kids could ever say good bye to their parents? And you took that away from them?"
"3855","Story time!
My class and the rest of my grade were outside, and my shitty school thought it would be a great idea for a lock down drill while we were outside! But that same day there was a shooting at a Walmart nearby and we had no access inside. I almost ran threw the woods to my house. Let's just say that was a very shitty day..."
"3856","A shooting happened in my school district last year. Thankfully a teacher was able to tackle the shooter down and disarm him. Some men also came by to educate my whole school about what to do if it happened to us (Some kids at a different school threatened to shoot up our school a few days after the intial shooting). They told us how to fight back, when it would be safe to go, and how and when being sitting ducks could either kill you. I totally support these kinds of drills. They prepare you for the worse so you can handle them more calmly. It's sad how it has become necessary though..."
"3857","My friends and I always said that if a shooting was to happen at our school we should hope to be in the chem room so we could throw acid on them or the Material Science room where there are about a dozen blow torches. Then again those rooms have a back door so we would probably run."
"3858","I will piss my fucking pants."
"3859","bro if you went to my school the shooter would get trampled or jumped by the students when we go into panic mode"

Totally a drill!! God that just makes me upset. They don't tell the students or the teachers anything. We evacuated to a near-bye church but a shooter could have easily made a fake bomb threat and hid in the church- where all the kids would fucking be.  Sorry this just makes me really upset like.

Me and my friend both played clarinet so we were just practicing things and all of a sudden they call a code red. (lockdown) now idk if this is all schools but drills arent allowed for afterschools, there never was drills. only during actual school hours. so obviously we freaked out and we went into the room where all the percussion instruments were and played im going on a picnic. just to kinda distract and calm us; but me and my friend were planning on what to do if the schooter came in, and how we had all this stuff to attack them with. after all of that pressure and drama they called it clear and we went out, the next day i had asked my teacher what happened and she said an angry parent was on campus.

"4013","what has America actually come to, they now have to perform ""lockdown drills"" so they can prepare for a school shooting! maybe guns are too commonly available maybe something should be done about that. maybe the right wing lobbyist should stop funding the NRA under the false notion of protecting their 2nd amendment right which is ridiculous as this is the 21st century with morels and laws its not the wild west where you settle problems with a shootout. look at country's with extremely strict gun laws how many school shootings do they have, virtually zero and they do not have to perform lockdown drills as they do not live in a society of fear mongering and fear tactics to make big gun manufactures lots of money. although after all I have said its probably too late for America anyways as there's simply too many guns already in circulation and they can probably never get rid of them because of the sheer numbers and the fact that people are too scared to stand up the ""patriots""who for some reason need guns."
"4014","this is how messed up america is with guns well ive crazy idea BAN THE GUNS YOU IDIOTS BAN GUNS"
"4015","but what if 1 million school shooters come in?"
"4016","Imagine if there was a school that transformed into a military base as soon as a school shooting happens. and  everyone gets armed."
"4017","We were doing a test on what to do on a lockdown and I said throw the most hurtful thing at the armed person such as a giant bin of books or a hateful you sucky"
"4018","I can see a drill where the doors are locked and there is banging on the door windows, but why do they have the doors unlocked in the drill and a person coming in with a gun pointed at them?  How is fake being shot preparing them for a lockdown, are they just preparing them to mentally accept their fate?"
"4019","most school shooters go to the school. these drills are pointless, the shooters know where the kids are, and it makes killing them much easier. if somebody ever pulls that shit at my school I'm hiding behind the door, knocking that mf out and dipping quick af"
"4020","last year my school was testing the lock down sound and they didn't know but the noise was going off in the classrooms and the teachers didn't know that is was a drill so every one was freaking out and one guy in fifth grade was using the bathroom while this was happening and he freaked out and he jumped the fence and ran home it was really scary"
"4021","this school somewhat looks like jarret... why?"
"4022","Oh my god I got here from pumped up kicks"
"4023","There was an active shooting at my school and when they said lock down then I heard shoot guns  firing I got all the strongest people gave them scissors (sharp) and we then lined up at the entrance with all the others in the middle  and the guy came and I stabbed him in the arm like ten times and my other friends stabbed in the leg he didn't die but he was in critical condition he now is in jail and only 6 children died and he started in the 5 th grade area I was in 5th so he only got to 2 classrooms also I slapped the gun out of his hand then attacked,my teacher and everyone else was proud"

"4028","I'm lucky Singapore allows no guns :^) only terrorist lockdowns"
"4029","they need to put a safe room in class rooms, DO YOU REALLY THINK HIDING IN THE CORNER IS GOING TO SAVE YOU. this school is straight up wrong for scaring children like that. I'd rather get shot than a guy busting through the door and shooting everyone. i would be like CASH ME OUTSIDE HOW BOUT DAT"
"4030","Ha there dad  0 to a 100 nigga real quick😄"
"4031","When the shooter came in and the children took the shooter down, that part was funny."
"4032","pretty much if there was a shooting drill I'd jump into a closet and come out when everything is over and then run to the junior high associated with my school"
"4033","My school tells us it's always a dill because one time two students ran across our track field and jumped the fence"

"4047","Beef Jerky are you fucking stupid?"

And we get told where the shooter is because if a teacher sees them they call to the office and tells the whole school. We also are allowed to throw stuff too. I think it's a great plan."

"4050","This is beautiful, you are my hero, run over that ducker"

"4055","If I saw a school shooter I would actually kill him."
"4056","""Are you worried this scares students?""

Fuck if their scared it's if their getting shot"
"4057","We had one a few days ago for 20 mins , but about 2 - 3 months ago we had one for 1.5 hours . I was in P.E. class , I'm a guy , we went into the girl lockerroom , lol !"
"4058","so everybody is expecting the shooter to specifically have a pistol? What if the guy has an ak47? Does throwing dictionaries help then?"
"4059","The shooter can just spray them all down as they hopelessly hide in the corner!!!!"
"4060","The fact that this is a thing is just too much for my head to handle what the hell America like Canada is def not a safe place we have our own problems with terrorism and such but holy shit School Shooting Drills why please just try to do something productive with maybe your gun laws, president and/or other leading factors to this mess of modern society"
"4061","Let's be honest here, those teachers would hide and cry in a real lockdown instead of fighting the shooter."
"4062","*Shooter walks in*

Everyone throws tennis balls at him."
"4063","The fact that this is actually a THING is fucking scary.

I grew up in Suburban England and this is absolutely unheard of here.

To think you guys as parents or even as children have this fear every day of your lives. I don't know how the fuck you can manage.

You're all fucking heroes <3"
"4064","You dont hide, and that's so easy to find. flee the fucking building."
"4065","oh my god that's fucked up man"
"4066","You can never be ready for a shooting"
"4067","all our school does s a 🔥 drill"
"4068","okay but let's be honest I'd be so far gone away from my school. as soon as I hear that P.A come on I. Am.  Gone."

"4071","M16>Child"
"4072","I'm my school we get to hide any where we won't just as long we be quiet"
"4073","These drills obviously dont work. If it were up to me to make the lockdowns, I would have the windows more outer from the classroom, so the shooter cant peek in more. The school which did the tennis balls was an actual good drill, but it isnt wise to have the students hide in one place. There should be more protection for schools, like a small police dept. near the school, if there were a lockdown the police from the building would immediately come. Hiding in one place and turning off the lights is very unessasary. Teachers should have a better plan where it says report to one area to distract the shooter, and perhaps lead them to the area so police can get to them, or more police in the schools. The government has much more money to support the school so why dont they HELP?"
"4074","IF SEE A BAD GUY WITH GUN THROW STUFF AT HIM"
"4075","oh hey whats this.

and im a psychopath.

"4080","this is the biggest bunch of b******* I've ever seen in my life communism at its finest you never teach children to live in fear of going to school and learning this is what parents homeschool their children because a crap like this"
"4081","Yea, tennis balls ""will"" do the job, use basketballs or bowling balls instead."
"4082","K'now my school did this exact same thing and one time the school didn't tell us and when my teacher said for us huddle all TOGETHER, and I said wouldn't that be easier for the man to kill us. So I took the fire extinguisher and ran off campus hid in the bushes."
"4083","Our school was on lock down for 4 hours. 



Teacher played loud music, we played on the computers, texted our parents. And yelled for no reason😂. 
Halfway through  the  lock down I texted my sister and she send me a pic of what was happening. A guy was shooting at people, there was like 15+ cops, 3 helicopters, swat and everything. and we were making that much noise😂"
"4084","This is why we need security guards who aren't overweight and with guns that are mentally sane"
"4085","Give the teachers guns and gun training"
"4086","And people wonder why I think the UK is better than the US. Uk: school Usa: Shooting range."
"4087","The fact that America has these drills is just fucking nuts get rid of the problem the thing that does the shooting, you know like the weapons themselves."
"4088","Schools idea of surviving a shooting: hide behind their desk and wait.

My idea of surviving a shooting: give every student an AK-74 and a bulletproof vest and their good to go."
"4089","Can these guys come to my school because the only tough people in my school are my teacher and my 2 ONLY 2 gym teacherS"
"4090","yeah he's out of ammunition, but the shooter may have a backup gun ready to go."
"4091","DON'T LISTEN TO JOKIE DAWN!! FORMER SWAT TEAM GUY IS FULL OF SHIT.. WHERE DOES HE GET HIS DUMB ASS ADVISE??"
"4092","goofy, goofy, goofy!!!! in real deal situation, all the shooter had to do was to knock her hard on the head (the guy had her in a dominant position) and she would of been shot execution style.. SO DON'T TRY AND BE A HERO.. IT'S NOT WORTH RISKING YOUR LIFE."
"4093","goofy, goofy, goofy!!!! in real deal situation, all the shooter had to do was to knock her hard on the head (the guy had her in a dominant position) and she would of been shot execution style.. SO DON'T TRY AND BE A HERO.. IT'S NOT WORTH RISKING YOUR LIFE."
"4094","in real life don't even try taking down an armed nut! it's like trying to take down a hungry male lion..
THEY'RE KILLERS!!!!"
"4095","all schools should have at list one ASA at all times on duty."
"4096","what if the shooter is a sumo wrestler! how are the teachers gonna take down a HUGE PILE OF SHIT that large?"
"4097","WTF? I feel so bad for the younger generation. When I was growing up, this would have been unheard of."
"4098","The students from my school makes fun of school shooting . Like if someone knocks on the door, someone would always shout, ""SCHOOL SHOOTER!!!!"""
"4099","We would have a lock down in like 1st grade and our principle would yell crazy and scream in the Hal's banging on the doors"
"4100","They should play Pumped Up Kicks on the intercom to keep them from bullying other kids"
"4101","THAT GIRL RECORDING ON HER PHONE ""oh hey cool I'm going to post on my snapchat story that I'm about to die ayy lmao"""
"4102","If you ever have a real lockdown, and your class is full of football players or strong boys and girls, tell them to fight the shooter. But avoid the gunfire as much as possible."
"4103","Yh lets get some tennis balls that we keep handy in the class and let's now get some skinny white girls to take him down."
"4104","we did this in my old school and there was a shooter that walked in our class and he pointed a gun at my teacher saying he's gonna kill her and i was behind the desk behind the shooter and snuck up behind him and had him pinned on a headlock and we were fighting and 3 of my friends got in and helped. that'll teach that fucker not to mess with me again or my friends. it doesn't matter the size of someone you have to use their strength against them. I'm only 170 something pounds but I took down a 200 something pound man. i was rewarded for most bravery during a shootout at that school "
"4105","If you know someone and you think they could possibly shoot up your school, try to be nice to them. You don't have to be friends with them, just don't be mean to them, because that'll likely decrease the probability of you getting shot"
"4106","Hey, WE had to prepare for NUCLEAR BOMBS landing on our school."
"4107","Don't always try to be a hero"
"4108","I remember when my school locked down during a terrorist attack in 2015, they need to let students know what was going on, we were stuck in rooms with no way of using the restroom or seeing parents for over 3 hours without word about anything. I'd rather panic and be ready than be a sitting duck confused with 40 other kids who didn't know what was going on."
"4109","bruh once my friend and I were in the bathroom during class time and we heard my teacher yelling her ass off for us to get back in the class for a lockdown I ran so fucking fast and there were kids yelling that it was real. Turns out it was a drill what the fuck."
"4110","Lol they don't shove us behind the desk they shove us in the closet and like we're all squished"
"4111","I never understood having all the kids group in a corner when a room offers many places to hide. If the room is small then by all means baracade the room and get as far away from the door and out of view of the window. If the kids can run safely (like if there are shooters in the school and you have a class outside in the athletic field) then have them run to a safe location. If students can hide then let them hide. If the shooter sees one person in a group of students hiding in a corner then thats about 20-30 free kills. if they see 2 or 3 in a room then it turns them into a game of hide and seek where they will kill a few and either waste time looking or move on to find better targets. With this kind of thing you want to either stop them or waste their time so even if you die, others can go on. I'm not saying to go out and sacrifice yourself, but if your life and others is at risk then anything you can do to buy time for the cops counts."
"4112","Once, my school had an fire drill..

We were doing swimming class.. we actually were terrified, we thought it was real and were contemplating whether to stay in the pool or not cause we were still swimming"
"4113","i know this is a serious video but two adults fighting with plastic guns is just funny"
"4114","holup we just gonna gloss over the fact that some dude went 130 in a residential area????"
"4115","I remember doing this but the one class didn't care, they talked that we could her them from downstairs, I'm glad they got detention for that"
"4116","this happened at my afterschool program. the teachers got on the stage and divided us into 2 groups. older kids with some younger mixed in, and younger kids with some older mixed in. they locked one group in the closet and put one group in what we call ""the hole"". the challenge was to be as quiet as you could. we sat for 5-6 minutes in complete silence in my group. one first grader started crying so she had to sit in my lap while i comforted her. my group (the older group) won."
"4117","Why don't you just ban guns? What is the matter with America? Let me guess, you have guns to protect yourself from other people WITH GUNS!?"
"4118","I thought it was a drill but when I got shot I realised it wasn't a drill"
"4119","Honestly my class is so retarted when we where just practicing/drill they we all went to a corner all together and the boys where doing push-ups the girls where laughing and just well fine if I have to be honest I was making them laugh LMAO"
"4120","anyone else bring a pair or siccors or a sharp pencil with me for protection during drills?"
"4121","I had a real lockdown there was a guy trying to kill all of usbut I wasn't scared because I play gun games and I'm used to it￼"
"4122","2:22 thats SOOOO stupid if thare were a shooter they cloud kill all of them at one they should make it
so that they hide in different places but  staying in a small area is bad if some body go's in and see all of them huddle up thay can shoot all of them and be close they are so close they wold trip and fall and DIE."
"4123","When the teacher has the gunman under control, the students come out and beat the crap out of him"
"4124","My high school apparently did something like this in 2001 and some of the teachers said they were locked in their rooms with their students for near 3 hours while the National Guard ""liberated them"". I think that the parents and students need to get a life. You never know when this may be become a real situation in schools."
"4125","I wish my school does this...we just hide behind a table"
"4126","""How do you prepare students and teachers to prepare for a school shooter?""
Ban guns, you bunch of trigger-happy gimps."
"4127","Personally, I think this is a great idea. It may save some lives."
"4128","Did any one notice the waving girl when the car was pulling in XD"
"4129",">be american"
"4130","bullshit"
"4131","and they're all dead"
"4132","My school dosent have a school shooting school"
"4133","this is fucking cringy"
"4134","All the other kids with the pumped of kicks.... Oh wait, wrong video"
"4135","At my school, they shove all the students in the classroom inside the SAME closet after locking the classroom door with a single key.. We don't jump out the windows, barricade the door, get hard objects to use as weapons, HELL, WE DONT EVEN HAVE A LOCK ON THE CLOSET DOOR, OR A SHEET OF PAPER OR ANYTHING TO COVER UP THE WINDOW ON THE CLASSROOM DOOR!! THEY JUST ROUND US UP INTHE CLOSET TO GET FUCKING SHOT!"
"4136","It's illegal to text your parents during a lockdown in my school. To prevent our parents from actually coming and risking both our lives and theirs."
"4137","I was in middle school and we had a lock down during PE, so everyone had to go into the locker rooms and turn off the lights. Of course when you turn the lights off there it gets pitch black. There was this one girl who had just arrived maybe last week or so idk and she ended up freaking out and crying out of panic. So I go over to her and I put my hand on her shoulder and I look at everyone else and say ""Okay here's the plan. If somebody comes through here with a gun, we take them down. It's just one guy, we're a bunch of crazy teenage girls who are stronger than they think. The boys, they're loud and dumb so they'll be first honestly, but we're not going down."" Some of the girls tried to point out that it was just a drill but I shut them up and we ended up spending the whole time coming up with an attack plan just in case it wasn't."
"4138","We just have lockdowns"
"4139","I think most school shooters would be scrawny teenagers with depression so flipping a 110 lb kid wouldn't be a problem for a full grown teacher."
"4140","No one takes drills seriously in my school. Everyone's laughing, talking, traveling from one side of the classroom to the other whilst maneuvering in between chair and desk legs like a worms. We'd be the first class dead, honestly."
"4141","During a lockdown drill I had to fucking piss so bad and it lasted for 10 minutes"
"4142","Don't hide in a group! That's stupid, they can just throw a bomb on ya'll"
"4143","What happens when the guy actually fights back? she does that to me im picking her up and shooting her in the stomach and legs until she lets go."
"4144","This is why I keep a combat knife and glock 19 in my back pack"
"4145","My school had a drill and I was in gym. Theres a little part in the wall that sticks out. We hide behind that. We were so loud nobody could hear it and I was cracking up for no reason."
"4146","Ahhh 'murica"
"4147","**In my recommended for a how to basic video**

Ok"
"4148","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks"
"4149","i remember when my school did this unexpected and I had to go to therapy for the next 7 weeks because everyday at school I would have panic attacks when the lunch bell or break bell went off , and I still do sometimes"
"4150","Fuck those psychos!!
Schools should really hire some security guards to prevent school shooters. 
5,10 or even 50 if needed.  
Its a parent's duty to send their children to school.  its the Schools' duty to return those kids safe, at ALL cost!"
"4151","Don't dew it jewett."
"4152","LIKE I SAW A NOT WEAPONS PERMITTED ON THIS PROPERTY SIGN AT A MIDDLE SCHOOL WHAT THE HELL ISN'T THAT COMMON KNOWLEDGE"
"4153","R&A Gymnastics that's a great teacher."
"4154","GhettoBoxMan I have a teacher who has a freaking hammer in her purse and she is crazy about protecting every one and she is like 60 😂!!!"
"4155","PG LC Spax lol"
"4156","amen 🙄🙄"
"4157","Electricity Water yeah it was an accident"
"4158","Fake. If there was a real shooter in your presence, you would probably shit yourself."
"4159","Diys,blogs,and more! Wow lol i feel the same"
"4160","until they fight back"
"4161","Don't subscribe Lol like 11 times i didnt pee in to morning and i also didnt pee at school sk i had to hold my pee for 3 hours"

"4163","same"
"4164","No Name nice"
"4165","RAGING PYRO i keep an ak12 and a trench knife in the backpack"
"4166","In my school... we had an actual lockdown (I was in year 4, year 5 now)!!! So we were eating lunch we saw a POLICE helicopter my friends and I just waved, then we saw two teachers running, my friends and I said ""stop running, you tell us not to run!"". We then were told to either run upstairs from the oval, come back from the library and just run right inside. Then we waited and did the Roll, when everyone was there we ran to the toilets with a lock so we could all hide, boys in one and girls in another. I'm a girl so I don't know what the boys were doing but I did hear crying... but the girls all sat in a circle and prayed. When it was done though we didn't have to work or learn we went on our iPads and then watched a movie. P.S. This incident helicopter to end of the day was about, 3 and a half hours"
"4167","This a real thing??? This wouldn't happen if they just got rid of guns"
"4168","My school did this and I broke the window and jumped out and ran to my home luckily I was on the first floor"
"4169","My school did this I crept up behind him and almost strangled him but I realised it was a drill dang I was trying to be a hero lol"
"4170","When the teachers practised, it looked like they were getting raped...."
"4171","Fat guys will win againts the shooter because the fat guy will lay on on the shooter"
"4172","When the guy was resisting and she was going super saiyan"
"4173","He got jumped 😂"
"4174","the fighting back, like a boss 😎 I don't get why people don't fight back, they are out there screaming hiding, I would fight back like these people! not like a coward running away...."
"4175","this just proves that 1 the principal there is an idiot the students do not fckin listen and message their parents that its dangerous when they are not suppose to causing the parents to go over to the school dangering them and making it even much more of a dangerous situation ""oh yeh well their kids give em a break"" guess wht they know how to fckin operate a fckin phone so and they were fckin told not to do this"
"4176","not very safe place behind a desk... a better place is just call 911 then when the police come, they can go home in a bus while the shooting is happening in school and police are in there shooting the shooters... like for good idea dislike for bad idea, I think its bad idea tho... 😛"
"4177","4/20/99 she probably bullied My Eric"
"4178","When we did a lockdown drill people were talking and I cried because it was a life or death situation. WHAT IF IT WASNT A DRILL???"
"4179","Bro if this happened to me the adrenaline would keep me going all the way until I ran to my house"
"4180","this would fail so fucking bad in real life"
"4181","I remember a shooter was about to attack my teacher but she use to be a body builder and threw him out the window"
"4182","Shit. The A.I. Is getting smarter..."
"4183","My school did a shooting drill last year and instead of sitting down my teacher went out into the hall and tackled the police man acting as a shooter. This story becomes way funnier when I include that my teacher is a small 4'11 women taking down 6ft 200 pound guy"
"4184","6:10 she was a pro"
"4185","oooooooooooowwwowowowowo"
"4186","Man, in America you do that. But in Indonesia you don't do that. That's cool man!"
"4187","wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo go hollie wooooooooooo"

"4189","there was an angry kid in my school ground he flipped over a goal post they had a flipin lock down xD"
"4190","What if like 3 of the Shooters came in aye"
"4191","There was actually someone with a base ball bat but with spikes on it, and a gun. They were near my school, and we went on a knock down every thing was quiet and my heartbeat was racing it was fucking horrible"
"4192","Next thing you know,The school shooter counters all these defensive maneuvers"
"4193","wait....




what if the shooter's goal is shoot on sight without hesitation or even going slowly towards them?"
"4194","The sad thing is that in really life the person with the gun could use his other hand which is free and beat the sh*t out of the people who is trying to discuss arm him Xl"
"4195","yo...do anyone wanna go to this school and expierince this?"
"4196","They probably did this 50 times so kids are laughing and sitting or playing with their iphones like again..."
"4197","Should I be worried my school doesn't do this?"
"4198","When one student is autistic and talks to the shooter trading his lunch with him"
"4199","if there is a shooter I'm breaking out of a window or going out a door and running"
"4200","In high school my teacher said ""Forget what your elementary school taught you, if you were to just all stand/sit in oe area, the shooter could shoot everyone in the class. So instead, you/we would break a window to escape the school, or get down low at different places in the room and block the door with the desk, the. throw stuff at the shooter. (like scizzors, coffee, anything really)"""
"4201","1:31 maybe if the school won't do those kind of lock downs instead.😄 A normal lock down would just be great"

Edit: I just watched this, I wish we could do this in my school.........I'm also pretty short, so  I'd be able to literally jump on them and take them down"

"4215","thank  ABC news"
"4216","To lighten the atmosphere in the comments, I actually have a funny lockdown story. So I was in 5th grade and I had a really cool, chill teacher. We had a kid in our class whose dad worked at a restaurant. So we were all huddled in the corner by the rabbit cage while he just stood there, eating soup!!"
"4217","I was hero I was working this guy comes out with a gun I ran out block the gun uppercut him stole the gun he was like fuck I was like back up bitch called the cops and guess whatttttttt they did they didn't give me any reward I came back home go in my room I put on the song




Fuck the police I'm a straight thug"
"4218","This is a terrible plan. ""sit in a corner and wait for the shooter to show up"". If Columbine taught us one thing, its don't count on the police and GET THE HELL OUT OF THE SCHOOL. Run. Hide, Fight IN THAT ORDER"
"4219","The problem with practising shooting drills without the students know some may not play alone when it's not a drill"
"4220","they could go cash me ousside how baw that"
"4221","okay okay, a bit of a storytime.
A while back I was in homeroom.
Suddenly, my teacher locked the door and told us to get under the windows
it didn't last long, but apparently there was a *DRUG DEALER* at my middle school!"
"4222","I and we haven't done the school shooting drill but if it does happen I will jump out of the window will my friends or lock myself in my locker."
"4223","guys I would just put on Jacob satouries and put it on the shooters ears and poof he dies"
"4224","what is  a 190 pound kid vs a 220 pound gunman"
"4225","All these parents are too busy babying their kids when instead they should be treating them as mature teenagers. It pisses me off that police get shit on for trying to improve these lock-downs. And shutting the door and locking it all in a group wont do shit. If someone comes in with a firearm intending to kill people they will shoot the door or kick it down and if he/she sees the kids sitting in a group thats it for them, they wont be able to do shit. They need to train Teachers in Firearm training and find candidates to carry firearms on them that way if there is an active shooter the teachers can defend the students effectively"
"4226","imagine if we never had a shooting drill, imagine how confused we will be when the real thing comes?"
"4227","I haven't done any drills but I expect some soon. I honestly want a drill, i love that adrenalin rush that makes you so more strategetic."
"4228","If my teacher got him/she (P.C) down I would kick him. Probably in the nuts or front part"
"4229","Why don't they lock the doors?"
"4230","Once i was practicing for my fsa and so was my class then we heard the fire alarm and we went outside and it was fake and the teachers had no warning either so few minutes later we went inside then 2 mins later BAM another one then ANOTHER then there was this one more so we just stayed, it ended up being real."
"4231","I'm going to tell You a Story Based in my real life This Is Real and not a Joke

So one day At my school 1 man with a Gun Almost Entered the School And Everybody was Scared so We Hid behind the Teachers desk,we stayed there for 1 hour And At least There was 23 Cops/Sherrifs and Then They arrested the Guy and turns out he was Drunk and High.

This is True this Happend 2 months ago from now Thank you for reading hope you Have a good day and I really don't need likes."
"4232","Look it this way when it comes to ""this is worse"", would you rather go out sitting and screaming, or beating the stuffing out of him?"
"4233","If they have too may drills they probably won't believe it's real and won't take it seriously"
"4234","When we had school shooting drills they gave all the preschoolers bubble guns and they go running through the hallways as everyone locks the doors."
"4235","WOW I WOSH MY TEACHER WAS THIS BADASS"
"4236","all they other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run outrun my gun"
"4237","wish had a teacher like that :(
my teacher doesnt give a shit about us all she cares about is the money doesnt even check if we type our homework right.. i ussally when i am like ,,meh screw this i dont want to do this'' i just type random stuff so she sees it and thinks i have done it"
"4238","this shows the shooters what we do why would they show this"
"4239","I would love to see my teachers learn to do this 😂"
"4240","But now school shooters know how to prepare"
"4241","One time at My Wallace elementary school we had a drill and it must've been practice I don't know yet... and I was shaking"

"4249","My school is in Pennsylvania and I think we only had one shooting drill at my Middle school (I'm now in Highschool.). It wasn't like this, it was just teaching us where to go if it happens and how to stay quiet (yet some jerks still talked. I mean yeah it was kind of in a whisper but still if I died because two popular girls wanted to talk about their dog. I won't be a happy spirit.) though my old computer teacher probably made the best impression because while most teachers stayed with the kids and hid as well, our teacher had a baseball bat and said that he would wait at the door so if anyone with a gun came in BAM and then he even said we could help beat him up once the gun was gone, and that we could use any object to hit the person as long as it's not the computers. That actually made a few of us HOPE a gun man was coming when we were in that class because we all wanted to fight. Either way, I think this is a good thing. We can't just hide because then the guy might find you and just shot us like shooting fish in a barrel. But of course I'm not stupid so I personally if it really happens, will hide in a place I see more fit and if someone comes in and nobody fights, I'll simply try not to get shot at and pretend to be dead. But hopefully I won't have to worry about that anytime soon."
"4250","all you have to do is get the strongest person there get a hard weapon  like a baseball bat or wooden cricket bat and slam it on there head knock that out💪💪🔨😵👮 warning dont try this i was joking"

"4253","In my school its very safe and highly secure --- I'm from the Philippines"
"4254","In my school its safer than prison, very very secured from criminals ~~ Im from the Philippines"
"4255","Yo the students are in the wrong, during a lockdown we're all told not to text or call anyone, because it can scare them and potentially cause a response, such as the dad who went to the school. This is exactly what they don't want, a bunch of stupid parents worried more about their own kids safety than the general public."
"4256","Once we had a lockdown drill and no one would shut up and they wouldn't stop laughing so the principle threw the door open and yelled at us but no one would stop laughing"
"4257","This is honestly so stupid. It should be 'lock the door, use anything u can to block it.'."
"4258","we don't do this where we are cuz you can't get a gun unless you're apart of the police force or security guards and such sooooo......... yeah greetings from Australia? ???"
"4259","I think a unannounced shooting drill is smart so the kids would know not to mess around because they might think it's real"
"4260","What do do of you have. A shooter in your class...
1.find out the fattest one in your room 
2.let the rest of the class stack up on the fat guy
3.cover the shooter face with backpacks until he gets knocked out"
"4261","I am so lucky to live in Canada 🇨🇦"
"4262","so these  schools are in Colorado MY SCHOOL DOESN'T  DO THERE THIS ALL WE DO IS HIDE LIKE WIMPS"
"4263","holy shit my typing is ass"
"4264","at my school they Sayed we had to be on lockdown we all hid Ina corner and noone would STFU all u hear is did barking police officers but it wuz just a drill"
"4265","If someone came into the classroom I would rush him with a group of classmates regardless of if he's a real shooter or not"
"4266","omg same"
"4267","You would have that one fat kid breathing heavily through a paper bag lol."
"4268","There like so loud sjssjcjcncncnxncb ncn"
"4269","Kawaii Kiwi same"
"4270","Rest in piss"
"4271","IM GOD!!!!!! 
that's awesome actually"
"4272","brw the teaching the teachers to fight kinda looked like wrestling :D"
"4273","WhoStoleMySocks You're retarded"
"4274","Lachlan Walker how exactly"
"4275","Dave Zabrocki so how is it in canda"
"4276","In my school if you are in the library you have to go into an old closet with everyone in there"
"4277","Another tip, make friends with the sketchy white kid who never talks and stabs himself with push pins. Also, don't listen to this video at all. You hear gun shots, take a fucking desk and fucking ram it through the window and book it down the street."
"4278","ofc its florida"
"4279","0:51 look to the left 

HELLOOO"
"4280","I swear if I hear a gunshot in school I swear I will be out the window running for dear life"
"4281","Next they need the song ""Pumped up kicks"" in the background"
"4282","If there was a school shooting I am not going to stay in a damn class I am out the fucken window as soon as I know the shooter is in the fucking building"
"4283","Good luck when the shooter's INSIDE the classroom."
"4284","1) the students aren't hiding so they aren't seen, they're hiding so they can't be shot through the window on the door or the door itself. 2) most schools don't go all out with guns and bodies. They just say ""hey, were conducting a lockdown drill, everyone do your thing."" And the kids go and hide. 3) when the fake lockdown drill is announced (at least at my school this happened) they announced it in a calm, worry-free voice so that in a real situation, they can be frantic when announcing it, without the risk of a ""boy who cried wolf"" situation happening. 4) many times (I'm not saying every time) a lockdown occurs, it may be a person outside the school is threatening to do harm, making escaping a dangerous idea unless you're lucky. I read a firsthand story once of a real lockdown where there was a man across the street from the school threatening to kill himself and anyone else near his home (Not my school)."
"4285","What the fuck am I watching? I guess this is a good thing to do, it's sad that it's needed though...."
"4286","my teacher doesnt give a fuck she said ""your doing your work no matter what so sit down and do your work"""
"4287","I had a 1 hour lockdown in my schools libary"
"4288","Columbine was a great shooting range. Am I right? And how bought that Sandy Hook. All those dead kids wow!"
"4289","I could whoop those little son of gunmans"
"4290","here's what happened in my middle school: they said ""it's just a drill"" then we went in the corner and joked about being the first to be kidnapped. In high school it actually happened once but i was just on my phone the whole time after i texted my mom."
"4291","We had this twice"
"4292","ABC7?"
"4293","I do agree that this would be a very scary drill! I'm going to a charter school for the first time for high school this fall so I may be doing these possibly, the most I've had to deal with were fire drills. But if you don't get the training to fight back, then everyone could be killed if you didn't try. I think that this was a great idea for them to do. Sure it would be terrifying in that time, but it could save your life and a lot of other's as well"
"4294","In every room theres a door that is blended with the wall we can slide open and theres a room that the class can fit in"
"4295","The shade basically lets the shooter know ur in there"
"4296","At the middle that like down the road and a few turns way and I'm at the high school but special ed so i got right up close to my friend that's a like a sister than panapal come on the P.A and sayed it real than i got all panicked than she put arm over me and healed me till it was over"
"4297","Bro if there is a legit fire or break in nobody is gonna follow the rules. Legit like people don't play. If there's a fire people will go in their lockers and get their stuff like really?? I think it's kinda dumb but maybe they have something important with them.  Also lockdown people will legit scream and run like lol they will for real run out of the school and dip blocks away 😂"
"4298","the school should have emailed the parents and told the police about this...."
"4299","I wonder what happens in a Chicago school shooting. More shooting or instant death? Oh wait I forgot, black people don't shoot up schools. (Don't take this seriously.)"
"4300","Holly had me shook"
"4301","how do I say this? eeh... MURICAAA FUCK YEAH"
"4302","if the lockdown wants a dirll, i would help the shooter lol"
"4303","No, I remember it differently with more Darude Sandstorm playing"
"4304","I wish my school did this"
"4305","Sir what do you want me to do with these pigs?
Jewett"
"4306","If someone even does come in the class can they not just turn on the light? And see them all"
"4307","Or you know just avoid the white kid. LOL"
"4308","At my school we do lockdowns, but don't have a fake shooter come in!!!!!! We just turn off the lights, lock the door, and hide behind our desks."
"4309","""5 minutes maybe"" PFFT IN LOUISIANA WE HAD SUCH A TERRIBLE STORM WE HAD ONE FOR 2 HOURS!"
"4310","Once in a real shooting that's my school this idiot thought it would be funny to scream his Longs out and yell I don't want to die thinking it was just a drill he got put outside of the classroom and got shot I laughed because I hated that kid"
"4311","At our school some of my teachers tell us if they go down to throw our text book at them"
"4312","tbh, hiding if a corner near the door is not safe. like really? thats still not safe the kids (encluding me) still, the kids should CHOOSE to hide a spot because their are millions through out billions of spots like if there is a closet HIDE IN THERE trash can with lid HIDE THERE really schools should let them pick hiding spots."
"4313","I got in trouble during one of these drills cause I told everyone to stop talking because they were all whispering but I'm the one who got in trouble like wtf"
"4314","I would ump on their back and they fall backwards but that would hyurt alot for me and btw i think my school never ad a school shooting im in colombine ok jk i shouldnt be joking
I would ump on their back and they fall backwards but that would hyurt alot for me and btw i think my school never ad a school shooting im in colombine ok jk i shouldnt be joking"
"4315","once i had a drill that lasted 3 hours"
"4316","I wish my school did this because then I would have a reason to hit somebody plus I already know how to defend myself and others so I and my class mates can and will act upon the shooter and will not let the teacher take a bullet for us. "
"4317","yeah cause obviously hiding under a teacher's desk will protect the kids"
"4318","I bet some kids were joking around that someone annoying in class would get killed or something."
"4319","I'm a black belt 🥋 soooo....come at me"
"4320","I really don't think they're seeing the point of this.  The point is that it's a better option then sitting in a corner and waiting for death when a shooter walks in"
"4321","As if tennis balls are going to hurt a full grown adult with head gear and googles. These teachers wouldn't show that kind of courage when a real gunman arrives, or if there wasn't a camera in their faces. These ""heroes"" would cower in fear like any other regular person.
School policy loves to put students in death-traps, I'd jump or climb out the window if I heard gun shots. If the teacher objected, I'd give her the finger, I don't want to die."
"4322","The targets move????!"
"4323","Um... Dictionaries or any type of book don't make very good throwing material. The pages separate and the book slows down significantly. The chair would be a better choice."
"4324","Go Holly!!"
"4325","I would jump out the window or run my ass off"
"4326","when that father almost got a ticket for driving too fast to the school, that was kind of sweet because it shows how he really cares about his son"
"4327","How about you Americans just put laws into place to Ban firearms to people if they don't have specific license"
"4328","Wtf we don't have this in my school or like any sane school in england"

Lyrics
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid
Yeah found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden oh in a box of fun things, I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet"
"4330","Once in our schooll we went into lockdown for like 2 hours and it wasnt a drill and
 they never told us why >:("
"4331","If you all hide in one corner, you are just allowing the shooter to spray-shoot you all in one go, twats."
"4332","Pew"
"4333","AND THATS WHY I ALWAYS HAVE, IN MAH BACK PACK A POC- A SUPER SHARP PENCIL"
"4334","1:21 pure speeeed!"
"4335","Omg my cousin was killed in a lockdown drill too it was an ACTUAL HAPPENING and they were scared to hell and they heard shooting in the teachers' lounge!!!!!0-0 T-T       ;-; R.I.P Aluna"
"4336","4:38 Yeah, like if that would ever work."
"4337","We better kill these mother fuckers with ""Knowledge"""
"4338","YouTube pranks aren't that different."
"4339","Why would anyone want to kill kids."
"4340","What does hiding in a corner do anyway"
"4341","if i was there id be holding a trash can or something id throw it and wack him and i can tell my one of my classmate would cry"
"4342","Australia just has fire drills cos like we don't have guns"
"4343","Wish my teachers were like dis"
"4344","okay it's the parent's worst nightmare but what about the kid?"
"4345","jeezus christ thank god i dont live in the usa"
"4346","We done this once and it was fake and I was getting mad because I was stuck in the corner"
"4347","There's a reason schools in other countries don't have this drill. Because some Americans are so attracted to their killing machines that they fight against them being banned in a country that has a mass shooting even other week.... Maybe if you took away the guns, there would be no need to cower in fear from them. Just a thought."
"4348","My drills are turning off the lights and reading fuckin impossible"
"4349","why dont they lock the doors"
"4350","Out school does this weird thing where the principal says ""could brother Cregan please come to the front office immediately"" and then they play classical music out of the speakers.  No jokes its legit terrifying."
"4351","it could be like the boy cried wolf... they could just keep thinking they are drills even when there not"
"4352","Wouldn't having drills make kids no longer afraid of shootings making it more likely for them not to take it seriously hence for them maybe getting themselves killed?"
"4353","Yo we don't have these drills But if this ain't no drill I'm running the FUC away. I ain't going to stay in a room and wait for my death. But if I gotta I'm barricading that door with everything."
"4354","Most school shootings are fake, for the ones that aren't RIP"
"4355","Once in preschool, I actually had a lock down, we had to sit down hiding while the teacher read a story. It was scary, but not as bad as these drills. Sure it was only because there was a threat a few blocks away, but dang."
"4356","You know your country is fucked when you have to have school shooter drills"
"4357","Eugene"
"4358","During a school lock down, which was a drill but we didn't know at the time, my class were all hiding in the band room, and the band teacher was up against the wall right next to the door holding a trumpet, looking flipping murderous. scarred the crap out of me."
"4359","I asked my principal ""What would happen if there was a school shooter and I threw the desk out the window and climbed out?"" He said I would have to pay for damages. Fuck that, I'm gonna live. And I'm going to encourage other little bastards to climb out also."
"4360","I'm in 7th grade"
"4361","LOL WHAT IS THIS?
I've never had any shooting drills like this xDDD"
"4362","""oh he comes in..."" And giggles like wtf mate"
"4363","Why don't other schools do this?"
"4364","So why are pocket knifes not allowed in schools again?"
"4365","Yeah that's a great a idea hide in corner while theirs somebody waving a gun around, yeah while you're doing that I'm gonna be booking it home."
"4366","This is why I go to a very conservative school. I know of a few teacher with concealed carries( I think and guess) so the shooter is screwed plus it has a ton of crazy wit boys. Yes we are in the south"
"4367","At least I live in New Zealand, where close to no school shootings has ever happened. But I just want to say I give out all my heart to those who have fallen victim."
"4368","at the end when the teachers get something to throw the shooter get recked"
"4369","like 15 years ago a school shooter came in and killed the principle and both secretarys but was taken down by the vice principal."
"4370","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS"
"4371","Son texts dad
Dad: oh I know I'll go there"
"4372","Why the hell don't they teach kids to push their desks against the door to prevent them even getting a chance to force the door in if they ran into it?"
"4373","These drills are good for the schools! Because when people are in a lockdown drill all the girls are talking and in a real event that would get us killed."
"4374","We have a new drill where if someone comes into the classroom during a lockdown we throw things and fight back, or we run from the school as fast as possible..."
"4375","Ayy Lmao you forgot while listening to pumped up kicks"
"4376","aliecat 05 You should've killed the school shooter,picked up his gun and finish the job"
"4377","Do you release how easy it is to kill someone with a gun? You don't have to run up to them or even be close. It's just a pull of the trigger and someone's dead. Pull it a bunch of times and a bunch of people are dead. It's sole purpose is to kill. And if it's against the law to have a gun, shops won't be allow to sell them, so it'll be a lot harder to get them. Knifes and fire axes on the other hand are harder to kill with and have other practical uses (I don't know why you'd have a spear). And you very rarely hear of people mass murdering with knifes and axes, because if someone sees a murderer running up to someone else with a knife, it's much easier for them to escape. You can kill with a gun from miles away. It's not going to stop murders from trying, it's going to stop murders from murdering - especially if it's a lot of people. Cars also have a practical use dipshit. Why do you even need guns unless it's for hunting? Does it make you feel powerful having a weapon for murder in your possession? Mass shootings happen because people like you let murders get guns. No one needs guns. So ban them like every other developed country."
"4378","anime june Right, because people can't illegally buy guns. Take a killer, put a gun, knife, a spear, and a fire axe in front of him. He will go for the gun. But get rid if the gun. Is he going to say ""Well, I don't have a gun,  all my murderous tendencies went away"". No, he's gonna grab that knife or axe and still kill people. Should we can cars because car accidents kill people? No."
"4379","It just takes one suicidal kid or sociopathic maniac..."
"4380","but if everybody had a gun
who would want to shoot up a room where everybody is armed to the teeth"
"4381","BoulderZapp Most school shootings only last a few minutes. If the door is locked and boarded up by desks, chairs, ect., they aren't gonna take the time to fight their way inside."
"4382","Blank Realist well it would but it would be useless, he would get in anyways, heres a better idea go out through the windows xD"
"4383","David D or she"
"4384","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks"
"4385","during the drill, all you're going to hear is pumped up kicks."
"4386","There should be guns in every class room on the teacher of course and what I mean by that is the gun is strapped to her hip at all times. If there were that could have prevented that sandy hook shooting, every school should have the teachers trained for the scenario to use firearms to protect every one else in the room. I know I would feel safer if a teacher had him at gun point than having them wrestle with the person.. guns have benefited us for quite a while. For example, guns provide protection for other people like what law enforcement officers do

  And here is one of the most said things that democratic liberal people say to trick you 
                                                                                   ""Guns kill people"" which is wrong people kill people with guns, you could kill someone with Anything actually for example a brass pipe or your fist even.

But the people that tell you these things are taking away guns from the public so they can be left defenseless, and criminals don't follow laws. So what makes you think that that will follow gun control laws? But the political elites that tell you this protect themselves with guns, because they think their lives are more important that yours.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, have a blessed day!"
"4387","The longest actual Lock down we had was 2 hours :D"
"4388","Ha they said the longest they ever had was 5 minuets at my school we were in a locked room for 3 hours and kids had to use the toilet bucket"
"4389","jeez"
"4390","At my old elementary school if one person even walks by a fence at the playground then the whole school is on lock down"
"4391","more schools should teach defense and ways to attack the shooter"
"4392","Am I the only one who's school just throws anything and everything at the door and heaps a personal defense item so if they come in you throw it, no just me?"
"4393","If there's a shooting you bet I'm gonna grab a stapler and staple that mother fuck not hide like a bitch"
"4394","Schools should let permitted teachers carry firearms on them"
"4395","When i was in kindergarten the teachers did a un-announced school shooting drill and me being a little 5 year old thought it was real so i started screaming and crying for my mom and tried to get out the window. And then the teacher told me it was fake and gave a sucker so it was worth it i guess"
"4396","It's different here in Alaska. Instead of cowering like sitting ducks, we are expected to charge and tackle the shooter and throw chairs at it."
"4397","in my school everyone grabs things like book so we throw it at the shooter to unbalance the gun. we don't hide behind the desk because thats retarded when you do that they break in and just shoot everyone."
"4398","Oh god I'm the only person who takes karate including my little cousin and I live in Colorado..... I'm just gonna throw a chair and do some high class wwe moves 😂😂😂😂"
"4399","my STEM teacher is great... others...not so great. With my band teachers, they just make you sit in your normal seats as they turn the light and you just sit there and wait for time to pass by. in STEM, our teacher pulls the the freaking cupboard in front of the door and tells us to arm ourselves with scissors, books, pencils, laptops and whatever else we can (including the evil fake tree in the corner of the room that has cursed many people, put someone in the hospital, and made the air conditioning stop) while she stands guard.... quite a difference huh..m not your normal teacher :) I get to have her for the next 2 years! she's great. I've had a lockdown before, and it was really traumatizing. I actually ended up knowing more about the whole situation than the other kids, I saw the person who caused it, i saw the cops chace him, I had other experiences in the past and sooooo on
if you read this whole thing.. you just got a gold star sticker thingy. congrats!!!"
"4400","She looks like Chloe..."
"4401","Of corse it is in florida i live in florida"
"4402","Fake"
"4403","Mandatory self defense class for second graders."
"4404","Unrealistic, no one died."
"4405","Good job for this school!"
"4406","my school doesnt do that phew"
"4407","we don't do this at my school. we do hide in place when somebody enter the school. before  while the alarm go off I'll be on next interstate highways"
"4408","My school my classroom has a door so if a active shooter comes we book it out that door and to the gas station or post office"
"4409","So guys is it time to get my bullet shield?
Folding or the pull up?"
"4410","If a shooting happens at my school, I'd feel like attacking the shooter, not scared to death. And hold the shooter's gun. IDK why, but I like weapons."
"4411","With our school, we have 3 procedures. 1st: try and escape the building and run as long as you can. 2nd: if you can't escape, barricade all entrances with as much debris as possible. 3rd: if the shooter still manages to get in, grab the nearest object and either throw it or attack the shooter."
"4412","The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must"
"4413","Possible thing
Everyone go in lockdown there is a shooter"" 
Me: goes to backpack 
Teacher: what are you doing 
Me: grabs knife
Teacher: hey thats not allowed!
Me: thank me im gonna save yur life
Teacher: how 
Me: goes to door 
Friend: ur dumb a little kid cant kill a robber 
Me: so 
Friend: ur gonna get shot!
Me: no
Friend: ur dumb
Shooter: imma kill you 
Me: *jumps up* raaaah! 
*stabs*
Shooter:its just a drill geez get me to a docter 
Me: no
Teacher: AAAAAHHHHHHH"
"4414","it is sad that they have to practice this."
"4415","""Kinda scary huh?""
Me: JESUS FUCK IM SHATTING MY SELF"
"4416","How about ""don't have guns""?"
"4417","fun defense and everything woohoo, but one shot with a glock while the back faces your ribs and you are fucked"
"4418","Well, my school has never done this, that's reassuring."
"4419","all the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run and outrun my gun"
"4420","Fuck enlisting the football team, call in the wrestling team"
"4421","Why doesn't the US just ban guns"
"4422","3:49 I would have did an RKO on him instead. (RKO is a WWE move.)"
"4423","WTF"
"4424","that guy obviously wasn't trying when they said he was gonna fight back."
"4425","If this happened to my school i would jump the fuck out of the window"
"4426","my school literally just has everyone hide in a classroom, lock the doors, and pretend that no-one is there."
"4427","Wow teachers and kids ambush school shooters... good thing that School shooters wont come alone. You ambush 1 the other one take your brains out stupid drill"
"4428","The kids would do great at the at taking cuz video games and piggy back rides for the save"
"4429","*intruder walks into school*
intruder: lol there's no one in the corridor so I'll go into the classrooms
*intruder walks into classroom*

intruder:hey can I know the wa......
teacher:KICK HIM IN THE NUTS AND GRAB HIM BY THE PENIS THEN LEG IT!!!!!!"
"4430","Lets bunch all of the children together so they're easy picks, really fucking good."
"4431","I don't understand why all the people have to get into a corner, wouldn't it be just easier for the shooter to shoot the people if they were all in the same place?"
"4432","He kinda sounds like Donald trump"
"4433","The only thing we have a drill for and might scare kids is the fire alarm"
"4434","Not always guns...
My school once had a lockdown because there was a deranged student attacking cleaners and dinner staff with a baseball bat.
I mean some kids in the cooking classes through eggs and the science classes used some chemicals to stop them but what else. Most kids just hid in the bathrooms."
"4435","Do they only do this in America"
"4436","I think this is awesome!
As long as they kids are warned that it is JUST A DRILL, and WITHOUT FIREARMS.
Only drills we do in school are fire drills..
Throw your stuff on the floor and go outside.
Fucking boring af!"
"4437","this is why when i go to a new building i always check how i can escape if something goes wrong. why hole yourself up to be killed?"
"4438","During a real shooting a kid in our class was laughing and shouting and then the shooter came in and shot him, and then the police came in. It was TERRIFYING."
"4439","1:40 hmmm... I have an idea







Ban the fucking GUNS!!!!!"
"4440","Thing about my school is one we have never had a drill and two we don't have doors or desks to hide behind so...."
"4441","last year we had that and one of my classmates got up and almost unlocked the doors"
"4442","I would wait till he runs out of ammo and tackle him with my friends."
"4443","*walks into classroom* 
""Hey guys. You know the doors aren't locked and there are loads of kids. Shall I shoot them?""
""Yes Greg. That's the point of a school shooting.""
*lots of people dead from one classroom from trying to be the hero instead of getting the fuck out*"
"4444","OHMYFREAKINGGOD"
"4445","What is a school shooter is watching there? they'll know what to do and not do"
"4446","People from my school would be crying so hard 


From joy"
"4447","We used to have lockdowns. We don't anymore"
"4448","The fact that this needs to be done is so sad"
"4449","They should make afterschool programs of ""What to do when there is an active shooter"" for students so they don""t get harmed when an active shooter is really there and not a drill"
"4450","Wow that teacher in the blue hoodie or sweatshirt is amazing in taking them down"
"4451","School shooters
=============

"4455","JOKES ON YOU

*THE TEACHER IS A SHOOTER*"
"4456","I wish children were trained in gun mechanisms / using guns."
"4457","Isn't hiding actually a BAD idea? You're literally just waiting to be killed. You should leave the school or find safer places to hide at least."
"4458","AND THIS IS WHY AMERICA SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS"
"4459","k"
"4460","Our school calls it the Crisis drill.
They have Two ""Armed Gunmen"" with CapGuns. Swat searches the school, Glocks, Automatic weapons made to kill. Burst down the doors, point ths guns at our heads. Stuff like that. They have kids from the Drama club act like they got shot. Way overboard."
"4461","THIS ISNT SCHOOL IS HAVE A STORY

one night me and my mom and sisters are outside on the garage we were playing taking pics and i heard my neighbor *Martha* And *Marga* scream My mom said ""ITS A SHOOTER"" we ran inside and i thing ""i jope my friends are safe"""
"4462","Once I had a soft lockdown at the end of the day so all the parents had to pick up the kids and the kids where called down from the office and when I got into my neighborhood their were swat cars and police cars."
"4463","""duck and cover"" that wont do shit bitch run"
"4464","Maybe schools should do regular checkups with like Psychology professionals to see if they're depressed or something. So they don't end up shooters"
"4465","*locks the door then puts a paper on the window*"
"4466","I'll be honest kids would be killed. A lot of them don't take it serious. When I was in 8th grade there was guys from cook county jail that escaped that's a big jail and they got loose we were on lock down me and my friends were singing bed intruder and people were laughing. I'm 18 and that was stupid of me. We thought it was a drill."
"4467","My school only does:
Fire Drills
Earthquake Drills
Lockdown Drills
Those are the following drills my school does so far"
"4468","on January 20th 2017 (The day donald trump became president) someone came to my school and shot 1 person and the person is fine but the crazy thing is that the person that got shot stoped the shooter from continuing the act it was a scary day at the beginning my friends kinda laughed it out but then it got serious when the announcer said ""this is not a drill"". anyway that was my experience and sorry for the spelling mistakes lol"
"4469","you know what he could do with his other arm right? 6:10"
"4470","*sees kid waving  at camera* No way that was fake"
"4471","5 mins was the longest you've had?!?! One time we sat in a corner for an hour and 15 mins"
"4472","I mean yeah I think that kids need to know what might actually happen if that guy or girl gets in the school but they need to let the kids know about the actors."
"4473","Wait hold on these methods don't actually mean anything or help with the situation since whoever is shooting up the school, HAS ACTUALLY DONE THESE DRILLS TOO WHEN THEY WERE IN SCHOOL, THIS DOESN'T HELP SINCE THEY CAN BASICALLY THREW A GRENADE INTO A ROOM.
Well congrats amurica."
"4474","One day at school we were getting ready to go home.1 minute later the fire alarm goes off (not a drill). my teacher runs to the door and we all line up really fast. since the door to go outside is right outside are classroom we go out the doors very quickly. everybody is on the grass and the firemen come. they search the whole building for people that are still inside the school.the next day we come back my friend tells me that in the teachers lounge someone just burnt popcorn. once I heard that I was laughing so hard thank god it wasn't a real fire."
"4475","My school has had a ton of lockdown drills. They pretend to have someone unlocking the door. They don't tell us it's a drill"
"4476","we do lockdown drills roughly twice per month and my god every time I feel like I'm going to die"
"4477","I would have Punch that cunt in the face"
"4478","The shades are a bad idea because if a shooter comes and sees the whindow covered he will know there hiding in there. If they leave all of the whindows clear they can hide at an angle that isn't visible from the window so they will never know who or if anyone is in there."
"4479","If this ever happened, my dad would freak."
"4480","How do you prevent being shot by a school shooter ??






If you are the school shooter"
"4481","what happens if I'm the one shooting​ up the school"
"4482","And their protection is vital"
"4483","When they said it was every parents worst nightmare, I'm like what about the teachers cause then they might loose their job"
"4484","We've been doing it like this for the longest time. I still think that the system is so flawed."
"4485","That's what I'd do. My school wants all of us to sit in the corner most exposed to the shooter. I'd just throw chairs and random objects. If you're gonna die, die with style."
"4486","my plan would be grab anything deadly (defibs,chair,desk,etc) and KILL"
"4487","SpicyThundaMan Best part is, one of my classes is full of saws (we do woodworking) drills, and sanders/sandpaper"
"4488","SpicyThundaMan see? this is the most realistic plan"
"4489","We have 3 different hall monitors that have had previous combat experience, and an officer in the building at all times, and i'm pretty sure our school is considering giving our teachers combat training, and a gun."
"4490","Shooter: looks like nobody wants me :( i'll go home."
"4491","We don't do earthquake or lockdown drills as much we used to do at my school ;-; 
They must want us dead"
"4492","England, we had a load of bomb hoaxes which is a reason our sixth form had a bomb drill"

School shooter: What?
Kid: Chicken bu-
School shooter: kills kid
Class: Fap to gay porn
On another thought:
In my welding class we grab propane tank shots and burn them XD"
"4499","see our gym has a million doors ans Windows and some of the doors ans Windows don't have blinds or covers so most times we have lockdown our class is in the gym yepp we are so lucky"
"4500","THIS IS HPW FREAKING CRAZY AMERICA IS"
"4501","You know eugene's watching this...."
"4502","Does anyone that type of panic that sets in during a drill? 
*During a lockdown drill* 
Me: Oh crap oh crap OH CRAP * panic starts to set in* *holds breath*"
"4503","This is retarded who would just sit under a desk thinking it's a force field?! I would be in China by now"
"4504","He asked u if ur worried not if u like them"
"4505","Me and some other friends are small af, and if there is a fucking school shooter, me and them are grabbing my teacher's cutting knife, super sharp pencils, sissors, a stapler, and some other stuff, and hide in the cabinets where no shooter would expect a young person to be."
"4506","I remember this one time that we had a lock down. Even though it was just a drill my two friends were still talking, and they wouldn't shut up. Then they started yelling with someone else. After the drill was over I was like Wouldn't the shooter not be so stupid to assume that there are no people there. You see cars outside and think that there is nobody there? Also my teacher was like, even if the shooter somehow managed to bust open the door or the window, I would get you to the other teachers classroom. We would have to walk in a line just to get to the other room. We don't even have a shade to cover the window. My school sometimes is really stupid."
"4507","Its a school day. The shooter walks in, obviously armed with a fucking gun. What is huddling up in a corner and pretending not be there gonna do. He can just go into every room and shoot them down. Does the school actually have secure heavy doors or something? Cause otherwise this seems like suicide."
"4508","Just kick him in his balls, simple."
"4509","Thanks"
"4510","We have to do 4 lockdowns per year and tbh they really freak me out. We don't have actually people with guns showing up "
"4511","somebody get chad"
"4512","""these kids are great"" smh some of these kids watch porn before school"
"4513","Holy fuck make your choice, either you prepare, either you die.
People cry about everything.
'Boohoo our kids were prepared to Survive a school shooter.'
'Boohoo our kids got killed in a school shooting'
Like god fucking damn it, stop being a bunch of fucking pussies and make up your mind."
"4514","I'm so glad I live in the U.K. Where guns are banned which means there's a very low chance of a school shooting"
"4515","why can't I be a part of this😣😣😣😣I want to act dead cause I would trick my friend's 😂😂😂"
"4516","What the fuck is huddling up in the corner supposed to do. Do you honestly think a real school shooter won't just shoot/kick the door down and mow down the kids who're helpful massed up in a compact group? Much better to disperse, hide around the doors and try and gangbang the shooter the second he comes through."
"4517","i wold jump thro the window"
"4518","My school actually had a real school shooting"
"4519","It's so sad that America has to teach kids what to do in this kind of situation"
"4520","knock his block off"
"4521","Wow.... I remember doing these."
"4522","Last Tuesday my teacher was told there would be a lock down drill but they rescheduled without telling her, then someone set something on fire and my class saw that it was the fire drill light going off but out teacher said no and to stay inside and I said ""the room could be on fire right now and we'd still be sitting here"" and then we finally decided to walk out side to find out that it was an actual fire and not a fire drill, and that's the story on how I almost predicted my fiery death"
"4523","If you really want to stop a school shooting inmediatly, just suggest the school shooter you sucking his Dick. Trust me, i have experience"
"4524","it's hard for teachers. all of the kids life's are in his or hers hands."
"4525","If a school shooter comes through my school I'm jumping through the window and gettin outta there. It's just one dude with a gun and like a shit in of people. AND KOST OF THE TIME THE PERSON YOU'RE TAKING DOWN IS A KID SO LIKE MAN THE FUCK UP."
"4526","Most of the school shooters ARE STUDENTS. So maybe if the school paid more attention to troubled kids and realized a psychopath in the making when they see one than there wouldn't be a school shooter in the first place."
"4527","You fucking serious? Chill dude you have like, a better chance of being eaten by a shark and then that shark being bitten by a whale than being shot my a school shooter."
"4528","I know I will get hurt but I will beat the living crap out of him if he went in my classroom. NO ONE touches or hurts my friends. I know it's fake."
"4529","trip them and they'll  fall on legos you would put there"
"4530","Well I would backstab the shooter and do 360 noscope 420 blaze it "
"4531","how to prevent school shootings? Give trusted teachers firearms. (and publicize it)"
"4532","Unnecessary as fuck imo"
"4533","I got suspended when my school did this cuz he came in and I got up and kicked him in his balls"
"4534","drill or not, i'd probably try to kill the dude."
"4535","its called a lock down"
"4536","Dude, shooting are super easy to fight back to. Have your strongest student right next to the door, which invaders wouldn't be able to see, once he breaks down the door, go right to his balls, knee, or neck.

People need to stop hiding so far away in fear, because it makes you easier targets who can't move anywhere to retaliate or escape."
"4537","Emperor palpatine what do we do?

"4539","You guys are just being a threat and scaring the kids to f****** death don't do that when this happened in my school (cuz I'm in elementary ) I GOT FUCKING SCARED AS HELL WTF"
"4540","LOL the gun man could have been shot her awkward ass in the leg."
"4541","My school done this but by the time the alarm went off, I had already shot four children."

"4547","LOCK THE DOOOOOOOOORSSSSS. the first portion of the video showed how like police officers able to just bust through the door. I understand that in a real life situation, with enough force or violence, the door could be busted open but...like...can't the doors lock??? better safety for the children too??? I just like .....what?? lock the doors please...
unless they did and I didn't catch that oops lol"
"4548","its great to show you where the kids are at during a school shooting lmao"
"4549","My school had done a lock down but they didn't have guns it was only a teacher"
"4550","2:30 that kid's head is gonna give it away."

"4555","When you need to take your school children through school shooter drills, your country is fucked."
"4556","Omg in England we don't have school shooting drills, we don't need them"
"4557","I would love to be in a shooting drill!"
"4558","why the fuck would you hide.. our teachers said break the fucking windows and run as far as you can.."
"4559","Now I know why half of the school brings knives to school...."
"4560","i was once walking back from the bathroom and everyone locked their doors and I was still outside during the drill."
"4561","if i was there ill be screaming Ryūjin no ken wo kūrae! and start running"
"4562","It's kinda sad that they had to do this"
"4563","Yea let's just hide under desk smart! Let's not teach and arm our teachers that's a BAD idea!!!!!!!!!!"
"4564","My school hasn't ever done this, it's probably because there is a very higher chance that there is a shooting in America rather than England but still! There could be a terrorist attack"
"4565","Wait... wouldn't during a drill be the best time to attack?"
"4566","my school does drills and most of the time, when we'd do drills like the one in the video, many are talking with their friends like,""I'm so scared!!!"" and stuff like that and if we'd have an actual person on campus we would be dead."
"4567","Kids, the ABC news are filming us, so this time no fooling around"
"4568","wouldn't it defeat the purpose to upload or show things like this? I mean drills are there so the shooter would be clueless to what to do"
"4569","this isn't what most colorado schools do. every school i've gone to, in colorado, simply has us sit in a corner, lights off, away from windows and the door. no man comes in and pretends to shoot us, but sometimes faculty will bang on the door. some might, but in my experience, no."
"4570","I think more schools need to do this honestly"
"4571","One time we did a lockdown in 3rd grade and we hid in the closet. The drill lasted so long that i started crying thinking it was real :("
"4572","Me running out in the middle of the open to get shot"
"4573","my suggestion... bite the shit out of the as you bring them down."
"4574","OMG my pe teacher gave us a 30 minute lecture on lockdowns and what to do if we were ever outside a classroom"
"4575","This actually happens? My school has never done this before (my country is very safe). How often do ya'll have to do this?"
"4576","That fact that these need to happen really make me sad."
"4577","The reason why students are getting shot is because they don't know what to do. Preparing them would make a big difference."
"4578","thats why i bring my my own gun to school"
"4579","Once my school done this and the teachers didn't even know about it. Our teacher had a baseball and all of the students had pen and a desk ready to throw it also last about 2 hours. They even had search dogs for it all to be a drill "
"4580","Oh, so when my friend got shot in the chest it was just prank. Good one guys!"
"4581","Why the fuck would you hide in a corner ducking doesn't help they will just pick you of one by one making it easier for the shooters."
"4582","They should  take that to my school where teachers can get training"
"4583","Shit like this is why people shoot up schools."
"4584","why do they have to PUSH IN THEIR GODAMN CHAIRS in a lock down or these things my class  jumped off their asses and runs silently  to the positions and I once ate crunchy cookies and we didn't get caught (yes there's a real lockdown) it was funny and scary idk how I didn't get in trouble (I think the teacher was texting)"
"4585","Is that really their drills? What the fuck are they doing? First of all, you're only teaching the teacher on how to take down the shooter? you leave the kids out of it? REALLY? what's the point??? Any shooter with the slightest bit of competence is gonna shoot the teacher first, leaving all the kids defenseless BECAUSE YOU ONLY TAUGHT THE TEACHERS THE SELF DEFENCE. oh my god. oh they did teach the kids some drill I hear. the ""duck and cover"" drill. not even gonna go into detail with that one. the only thing i'll say is that you would be making it harder for the shooter if you lined them up along the edge of the classroom and painted a Red target on their heads, if you really think about it, it would because the shooter would have to use more rounds and risk having to reload mid-slaughter. 3 shots with a shotgun and all the kids are mincemeat on the classroom floor with the duck and cover."
"4586","This is 100% real it wasn't a lock down it was an evacuation tho.

I was having lunch with my principal and she was not talking to me she kept looking at the phone and going back and forth from one room to another. I asked her what was wrong but, she said nothing. When it was time for recces, (I was in 3rd grade) it was indoor for no reason but, there was a reason in the first minute the principal said ""we need to evacuate now! This is not a drill! This is not a drill!"" I stood up and calmly went to the back of the line with my few close friends.  My teacher looked frightened, she opened the back door, we speed walked but we didn't run. I sat down with one knee up and the other down, just to be prepared to run. Parents were here by now, getting their children to a safer place, my parents didn't come. It was an hour before the school made us go back into the building, I asked an officer why we were going into a place that could have a bomb and she said nothing, I went into the building and sat in the corner, thankfully there was no bomb. 6 months later there was another bomb threat it was less intense :/."
"4587","Doesnt the shooter hear the announcement ""Lockdown, this is a drill"". Like doesn't the shooter hear that?"
"4588","I had a lock down that wasted my lunch, I grabbed my lunch I was about to sit, Then I hear ""FIND COVER,LOCK DOWN, LOCK DOWN.Then I see a bunch of cops with assault rifles, And I hear from one of the cops that 9 kids were kidnapped or lost"
"4589","My school has never done this"
"4590","there a real code red in my school I would grab a pair of sisors and run out the classroom before the teacher locks the door"
"4591","This happened to me once.............. I was in first-grade. I was fricking terrified"
"4592","Snowflakes just need to be kicked out of their nests."
"4593","Fucking pussies 😂"
"4594","0:41 the girl siting there recording what's happening"
"4595","Wow this is sooo smart, what if there's school shooters watching videos like these so when they shoot up a school they have a idea of where the kids are and what they're planning on doing...Bravo 😂🤦🏼‍♀️"
"4596","How about getting OUT IF THE FLIPPIN SCHOOL???"
"4597","we should be prepared shouldn't we. AND tell me where ever the f you live there is no crime!!!!!!!!!!!"
"4598","+Jeff The Killer no I just have common sensr"
"4599","u the class clown ain't you?"
"4600","And then this other time where my science teacher was telling us the instructions to follow during the drill, and he told us he'll lock the door, and get us near the door to another science supplies room, and I said ""if we get away from the Window at this angle, wouldn't the school shooter be able to peek over the window and see us clearly, but if we get closer to the window, if he is not abnormally tall, he won't be able to see us?"" and he got pissed and told me I was wrong, then I asked ""what if the school shooter is smart, sets off  fire, waits till everyone is outside to start killing people? what do we do then?"" and then my friend turned around and said ""dude why are you asking these things, it's almost like your planning them"" and my teacher replied ""listen it's only a lock down drill ok?!"""

"4605","This is exactly the behavior that made tons of kids in columbine pay with their lives. In the library, where they shot the most kids, the victims were kids who did just hide below desks. The shooters just went around the room shooting one after another point blank with no problem. And that's almost 18 years ago. 
Who the hell made this training? They STILL didn't learn from what happened 18 years ago? What the hell?!
Just get the fuck out of the building if there's a shooting!"
"4606","Cops are different. They're potentially more aggressive in a crime chase. Now lets think here for a second, lets say someone has no crime history and is about to do a crime because for whatever reason. They get properly licensed and trained.

"4615","If i was in a school shooting i would disobey my teacher by hiding behind where the door opens and when the shooter opens the door I would (A) grab some scissors or anything sharp and hurt him (B) i would smash him or her with the door or (c) just straight up take him down and disarm him and threaten him and if he doesn't obey either keep him down and dial 911 or shoot him"

"4619","Sheeeeit, fuck that fighting back shit,  my ass will jump outta a window, run home, call my momma, lock the damn doors, grab all the knives and sit my ass down."
"4620","Always have a different plan then what the school has.
EXAMPLE: SHOOTER ON CAMPUS
Teacher plan: Hide in the closet and turn the lights off.

My plan: Barricade the door with the nearest heavy chair or desk. Lock the door and pull the shades down. Use something to unscrew the American flag in the room, then cut the flag off to make a spear, or sharpen pencils with a hand sharpener to make less noise. Turn the lights off then hide in the closet with the pencils in hand, ready to strike the shooter.
My Plan B: Run as fast as you can out of the school, hiding behind nearby buildings until you reach home."
"4621","I'm so glad schools in England don't have these, I'd die from even a drill"
"4622","And this is why
I never go to the bathroom in school"
"4623","on the first day of school my teacher was talking about lockdown and saying if somone came in our room we take the scissors the desks pencils even our teeth and go crazy he also said that if the person was downstairs we would run outside across the highway and just wait there but what was scary is that he was serious about it and we actually praccticed it..."
"4624","When my school did a lockdown once they brought in drug dogs to see if people had drugs two people did but anyway we were in that drill for two hrs."
"4625","I think this should be in all schools because all the teachers do is put paper or something over the door window, Lock the door, and close the blinds! The shooter could easily break the window! And in schools the dont even teach you how to fight so this would help so much!"
"4626","My school did this but before the alarm went off.... It was lunch time, I got a knife and slit the guys hand off (The guy who pretended to shoot...)"
"4627","I was in a lockdown and it was nothing like this...they're going too far."
"4628","the problem with my school is that EVERY classroom has a wall of windows that looks out into the hallway and so even if we did a lockdown there is literally no place to hide because an entire wall (some classes have 2) is made out of glass, it's really scary"
"4629","Then enforce gun control"
"4630","hows  america after donald trumps election"
"4631","6:21 SHE WENT STRAIGHT *ANIMAL* ON THAT NIGGA 😂"
"4632","6:18 if that was a real shooter he would of shot look at the way the gun is positioned and pointing at,and the way she's on the floor is terrifying"
"4633","Its just a prank bro"
"4634","Schools should have at least a team of counter terrorists with auto rifles and flash bangs to blind the shooter. Even for the bombers of the school at bomb sites a and b"
"4635","I desliked the video because I hate school I wish this could happen to my school"
"4636","6:10 that'd give enough time to stab him in the eye with a pair of scissors ;)"
"4637","If a shooter is in the classroom I'm not gonna throw a ball at him I'm about to ether jump out the window or fight him to his death"
"4638","lol"
"4639","Look, I don't want any hate or anything but how is hiding I'm a VISIBLE CORNER suppose to keep you safe from a shooter? Like, to be honest I would try to hid in a closet or if there is a window, trying to get out of the room like that. I mean the schools probably have their reasonings but still! And a lot of people that are gonna shoot a school will KNOW that the kids will be in a corner that anyone can see. Again I don't want any hate but this method of trying to hide in a visible corner is kinda, well, stupid. But this drill is very smart."
"4640","Once we had a drill.


We later found out it wasnt a drill."
"4641","Tbh my school doesn't do these drills. They only do fire drills. And the assistant principal doesent do it cause she says the school is ""safe"". 🤔😒"
"4642","sure, throw balls 
i'm sure that'll stop him"
"4643","Yeah go and a Rko a guy with a gun when he can shoot you from about 50 meters. Great idea mate.

Also in our school they just tell us to hide in a corned and wait until the police has shot and captured the shooter."

It still gives me chills every time I think about it."
"4707","Okay to all the people out there scared I want to give you a quick little lesson on how to disarm a gun man if he super close to you (like 4 feet and you can touch the gun basically). So you are gonna wanna grab his wrist and the barrel of the gun at almost the same time. You are gonna first aim the gun away from you then your gonna snap his wrist away at the same time.........its kinda like the scene in Fifth Wave if you have seen that movie. If you practice this over and over you can get pretty fast and strong at doing this and maybe one day it could save you and lots of peoples lives........just wanted to let you all know."

"4711","But what if the actual gunman actually punches, kicks, stabs or hits back? Then I don't think that they will survive attacking an armed gunman who may or may not have high powered rifle or an AR 15 and possibly a knife for possible close combat. These people are basically training the teachers and students to increase the likelihood of being stabbed, shot, injured or killed."

3. hide behind the teacher´s desk
4. stay quiet
5. if you have a gun, give it to a teacher (yes, our class has a permission to carry guns/airsoft guns/paintball guns)
6. When nothing happens, do not unblock the door or start doing something, just stay quiet
7. Wait for the police
8. When the police arrives, wait for them to knock on the door and say something like ""this is the police""
9. do not unblock the doors, just look thru the door´s window (sorry for bad english)
10. if it is a policeman, unblock doors
11. do everything that police says"

"4766","If a gun man comes to my school i would just go home"
"4767","So uh story time..
I was using the restroom to avoid the boredom of class and then I hear an announcement all they say is ""hide""
Then the cord makes a noise like it was cut off. Like you know I was in a restroom so I panicked.. I was in middle
School at the time and I was small. Luckily I was able to fit in the vents.. I found a vent near the ceiling but still
On the wall. I jumped on the stall and unscrewed the vent door with a pencil. Then I hear a door get kicked down
And screaming down the hall. Then gunshots. Like everyone else I panicked again and I was crying because I
Thought it was over for me.. I luckily unscrewed the vent and jumped up and in. I stayed silent just as I heard the
Bathroom door creak open. I was sweating and I hid further into the back of the vent. I kept climbing in the dusty
Vents and ended up on the roof. I see police and kids crying and just horrible things.. I got down from the ladders on the side when everything was safe.. It was already 6:00 pm by the time they let the kids back home.. I cried and told my parents everything.. They never put me in school again. I'm now homeschooled and shall never forget that.."

"4786","one time i had a 35 minute drill... we had fun sitting there not doing class"
"4787","at our school our teachers have to actually go *OUTSIDE* to lock the doors to the class!  One boy actually got locked out when he went to the bathroom and one of our teachers unlocked the door to get him and then they had to teach people what to do when outside the classroom.... when they go outside and im my mind im like ARE U CRAZYYYYY?!?!?!?!"

me: *stands up takes gin and says oh why dont you*"
"4789","This happened at my school and we weren't alarmed it was a drill......I tried to jump out the window and I swear that was a clear rock"
"4790","The scariest thing that happend in my school is a fake bombing. We had to evacuate  and stayed in a high school for 2 hours, I was in 2nd grade at the time. Another time there was a shelter in place where you couldn't leave the classroom you are in currently because there was a kidnapper outside And that happend in 4th grade. There was one more, a lockdown, when the firedrill came on, and a new staffs voice went on and that scared the heck out of me."
"4791","Some schools use nerf guns."
"4792","We never have lock downs at my school, and we used to have one every year in elementary school. I didn't know jack shit about columbine and when i saw a cop pass by the door i was terrified. I know way too much of Columbine high school and now i understand how terrifying it could be if Eric and Dylan were shooting up my school or someone insane trying to shoot up my school for no reason. I still question to why we never have a drill anymore; cause Sandy Hook is close to my location, and someone could come to my school and do that. My school is fucked up so that's probably a reason why we don't do those anymore."
"4793","Turning the lights out and turning the shade out is just asking for the shooter to come in"
"4794","One time in 8th grade we had a lockdown the Friday before my birthday(my birthdays on Monday). So basically we're in English class minding our business when all of a sudden someone frown the office gets on the loud speaker and they say ""attention this is a lockdown, I repeat this is a lockdown"" and what scared the shit out of us was that there was screaming in the background. We all go to hide by the closet and I'm like deep in the closet so if someone came in that room I'm probably the last one they would find. My friend was right next to me and were so scared and I'm starting to tear up because all I'm thinking is I'm gonna die before my birthday lmfao. It turns out it was a freaking angers parent that was in the office complaining about something and they had not gone past security to get a visitors pass. Smh."

"4819","when the actual fuck is my mom gonna be near me when a school shooter is on campus"
"4820","So in my school district its set up like this all on one road Elementary high school middle school so this guy went into the high school when i was in kindergarten eating lunch and basically he went into the high school and my school and the middle school plus high school went into lock down it was pretty traumatic for a 5 year old to understand and duck under a lunch table while sirens went on outside turns out it was the janitor of the high school who forgot something but im so glad because last year there was bomb threats at my school and we had to have police in every classroom with guns and tasers it was flipping scary but im glad it was only a cruel prank by a sick highschooler at home but yea other than that its not soo bad"
"4821","instead of staying inside of a school in the fuck out of there"
"4822","Once during a lockdown drill I was in the bathroom and then when police came in I yelled, ""ILL RIP YOUR EYES OUT BEFORE YOU CAN KILL ME"" then I heard the police start to laugh and I got to skip some of school to go to the police station because they thought I had a good tactics. Also once I jumped in a recycle bin during a lockdown and my teacher said I was smart except I found a lot of boxes and carbonated scratching me."

"4837","The cringe of the guy and the teacher fighting 😆😆😆😆😆"
"4838","OMG they do this at my school they hit the doors and yell"
"4839","this is a true story
one day at my school we were just doing work in second grade then our headmaster came on and he even sounded frightened ""all teachers go into lockdown this is not a drill"" and I'm like well poop I didn't wanna die at school and so we sat there for 10 minutes then I heard something it was the headmaster he said ""teachers resume teaching"" I later found out that someone stupid was running around in the woods near our school and had a gun I still worry if he even says lockdown because I remember that"
"4840","aaaaaaand one of the students is a real school shooter :/"
"4841","lmao there was an unannounced lockdown and we had a substitute teacher who didn't have the keys to lock the door

so we're all scared shitless and me and another classmate got a textbook in our hands, in case we needed to defend ourselves, and another classmate got a pair of scissors just as another line of defense 

imagine the scene: kids are crying, some are texting their parents, and the substitute didn't know what to do, so she hid under the desk. my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

we have the books in hand, and we hear running down the hallway. we hear some door handles rattling, like they're trying to get in, and they're getting closer

we prepare for the worst, and we all tense up as we hear the footsteps approach our door

so basically, i whacked a freshman in the face who was coming from the bathroom when he heard that the school was on lockdown. rip his face."
"4842","We only did a lockdown drill once and we have fire drills about once a month."
"4843","I'll throw my glasses at them and my friends book"

"4845","God lock down drills are so dumb. YAY, lets get everyone in the same spot unarmed and wait for the danger to come to us."
"4846","People are stupid. In the case of a intruder, why have kids sat in a corner, all cuddled up like sitting ducks? Why not grab whatever you can? Chairs, books, fire extinguisher-I'm happy that my teachers are smart"
"4847","During my lockdowns, I always plan how I'm going to escape lol. My friends dad, whose a cop, says it's safer to leave than stay in the school."

"4859","Shooter: get on ground I'm gonna kill you
Me: have a snickers
Me:better
Shooter: nope"
"4860","One of the worst things to do during a drill or real one DONT text you parents, because if they see the text they will most likely go to the school and if they do BANG BANG, there dead."
"4861","When you lock down you lock shooter in school."
"4862","Momment of silence for colombine"
"4863","In my tech ed class, if there is a lock down we grab a saw, drill, hammer, etc. and beat up the shooter. My teacher is BOSS!"
"4864","If that happened I would yell DONT HURT MY FRIENDS"
"4865","How about having no guns and they wouldn't have to spend recourses and money on the drills?"

"4867","MURICA! lmao, srsly fix your shit the US"
"4868","the practice dude looks recruit or thermite from rainbow six siege"
"4869","Wow, that was fucking insane. How about just investing in decent metal doors to the class rooms instead? You know, lock it and stay there. No..., you rather scare the shit out of kids and allow local police to live out their John McClain, Die Hard fantasy instead at a much higher cost... #OnlyInAmerica."
"4870","I was In 6th grade I was so small I hid in the corner next to the door teacher gave me a 
Binder I hit his leg and he didn't notice me XD"

"4876","In fourth grade, me and my friends were running outside to go to recess. Right as we got in the back (the playground), we heard screams from several 2nd graders. Lots of kids ran to see what was happening, and there was three guys with masks on, one holding a large gun and the other two holding knives. One 2nd grader was shot in the foot, and teachers ran outside and protected us as the other teachers called the police. They were arrested and put in jail. Those teachers were great teachers. 
*This IS a real story.*"
"4877","what if they have shields and roket launchers and ak-49"
"4878","When there was a lockdown in my math class the teacher said to stay at our DESKS!!!!!! Then we just get mowed down the second the dude gets through the door!! I hid under my desk holding a very sharp pen. One of the teachers down the hall was hiding next to their door holding a huge stick"
"4879","Whenever this happen at my school for real I plan to go the the workshop and grasp some chainsaws"
"4880","Dude i am 13 years old and i know how to operate a gun uf they get the shooter and i grab the gun he ain got no luck but still i dont wa t that to happen just in case"
"4881","I bet they still make you walk in single file out the school"

"4892","All The Other Kids With The Pumped Up Kicks......"
"4893","Fuck sitting in a corner I'm outa there straight out the window"
"4894","I think there should be a hidden room like behind the teacher's desk (because its the biggest and it is never shown to anyone  even if it is a drill
only if it's real"
"4895","stacking up the kids like that, makes the job much easier."
"4896","All the other kids with the bumped up kicks, better run better run, outrun my gun. 
All the other kids with the bumped up kicks better run better run, faster than my bullet."
"4897","Me: **In the middle of writing a really long essay**
Teacher: THIS IS NOT A DRILL
Me: Uh oh....
Shooter: **Shoots essay in crossfire**
Me: GOD DAMMIT I WAS ALMOST DONE"
"4898","All the other kids with the punped up kicks better run better run faster than my gun"
"4899","imagine having a whole school assembly when a lock down alarm went off and it was not a drill."
"4900","we practiced once and I had to walk across the school campus to the ""safe bulding"""
"4901","my old school lets the teachers carry there own guns."
"4902","""NOBODY'S GETTING OUT. YOU'RE ALL D--"" *balls fly right at his face*


I laughed more hard than I should've"
"4903","in my school, we were taught if in any case of a shooter to basically throw anything and everything to knock him out and run"
"4904","When there all together the shooter can shoot them all at once in my school we hide anywhere in my class room"
"4905","I wish they would show our teachers how to take down a shooter. If we had a real lockdown we'd all be dead in a second. Hiding in a dark corner isn't gonna save you from a gun."
"4906","Meme got real"

"4918","I'd get out and bust down the door and be like ""lol KILL ME PLZ"""
"4919","Our school just did a school shooter lockdown drill.




without the students"
"4920","id marry that chick tbh , the pawg wrestler"
"4921","Yea let's all sit in a line so the shooter can hit every shot."
"4922","you don't hide in corners because if the shooter gets  in you're all dead. you hide in different spots and the shooter gets in you can attack from different spots"
"4923","My room does not have a door"
"4924","The reason why the school does this is because they want their students to feel what it's really like in a school shooting.  In my school, they tell us it's a drill before it happens, and since the student know that it's not a real shooting, some students laugh, or talk to their friends.  School shootings are serious, and these kids need to know what it's like to be in one, before it's too late."
"4925","How the fuck did I end up here?"
"4926","I feel like the drills would prevent children from that school from starting a shooting,due to the fact that the students know that they are taking extra steps to prevent it"
"4927","My class has a tornado drill tomorrow, there were false alarms today '-'"
"4928","When they showed the part of teachers taking down the SWAT Members I was imagining this:


If I were one of teachers I would be badass and run at the SWAT Member and fucking football tackle him/her"
"4929","Thinking back How is blaring THIS IS NOT A DRILL in full volume over the intercom helping the shooter think you're not here?"
"4930","They are idiotswhy don't they go in a safe room or something they would get shot if it wasn't a drill they obviously don't care!!!"
"4931","Yes, sit in the corner where the shooter can just click auto and spray a hellfire in one corner of the room. That's a horrible idea."
"4932","allowed teachers  to concealed carry"
"4933","I remember drills when people would cry because they would specifically say it WASNT a drill. we would lock the doors and and the police would try to open the doors. we really thought we were going to die"
"4934","5 mins try having to sit for a HOUR"
"4935","I am in 6th grade and I don't know what to do during a lock down."
"4936","My art teachers said she would get the fire extinguisher and we would get the carving knifes"

"4940","Soviet Onion 
It's better to break your leg rather than shot dead. So I would jump even if it is second floor."
"4941","Exactly. I don't get this either. The entire thing of this should be: ""Just get the fuck out of the building, no matter what!"".
If you hide below a table or something ridiculous like that you'll give the shooter the opportunity to just ""clear out"" the entire room with absolutely no problem. He's just gonna shoot one after another like the shooters did in columbine to the kids who did just sit below tables in the library."
"4942","i would grab a 44. mag"
"4943","Soviet Onion im still doing it"
"4944","Meilianne Andries wtf does being a sand nigger have anything to do with this."

"4956","During our drills we don't even give a fuck anymore. They do one every week and no one even moves when they announce it. We just continue on with what we were doing."
"4957","A shooter is coming kids, now just stay in the classroom corner he will never find us."

"4969","Ever heard of the boy who cried wolf there gonna get bored and be like ah great joke mr under hill and then just get fucking shot clean"
"4970","So during their drill they leave some of the lights on???????? For a school drill I am pretty sure all the lights are supposed to be off so the ""shooter"" can't see you. Or I'm sorry we have to get the shot and we have to leave the lights on. Sure we have school lock downs but if it is real or just a drill you iust don't leave the lights on even if the principal is saying this is not a drill then don't you want the lights off??? Good job convincing the kids."
"4971","We had to have a lock down like this because a bear was in the playground and there was men with guns with those darts in them"
"4972","It's too easy to get a gun in the U.S. If you make it like the U.K then problem fucking solved. (Btw no hate to americans :))"

"5105","What I don't understand is that shooters will still know if your in the classroom they aren't clueless. If they were they wouldn't have th abilities to do it. So turning off lights makes no difference is there is a shooter. I'd say, grab objects to throw, hide, but leave th lights on because it's what all schools don't do and shooters know that. If the lights r on, it oooks like everyone left becuas if u were there thI lights would be off"

In fifth grade we had a bomb threat and had to wait for about 3 hours in 80 degree weather (I live in Minnesota so that's really hot to me) and we missed lunch, they had lunch at the high school but the whole school was evacuated and by the time my class got there, there was so no food left, we have also had multiple real lockdowns but only level ones and twos, like one time there was a crazy man in the neighborhood and police cars chasing him."

"5214","You realize they don't have to do this stuff in Canada."
"5215","The teachers are idiots when it comes to teaching them how to stay safe during these drills. This is what you should actually do. First stay calm, then look for a way out of the classroom. If there is 1, escape then, as long as its a window outside or something. Not like a door into the hallways. If there is not an escape, then barricade door(s) with heavy objects and that can block bullets. Once you think it is barricaded enough, find a really heavy blunt object or something really sharp or just something you know will inflict a lot of pain. Get other students that are with you in the classroom to join you with finding weapons and getting ready to fight if the bad guys come in. Not everyone has to get a weapon, just students that would want to fight. Once you have all of the people get set up in good places near the door(s) and wait for them to come in or until the police are able to take the shooter(s) down. The teachers just say lock the door and close the curtain for the door and hide under or behind a desk or the teachers desk. Thats how you get shot, might as well say HEY WE ARENT JUST SITTING HERE IN PLAIN SIGHT! If you decide during a shooting that you should follow these steps and the teacher tries to stop you. Say this is the right thing to do or something like that. IF they try and grab you, fucking punch that bitch off of you and resume doing what you need to do. Also forgot to mention, if you take down the shooter and the shooter is on the ground like they are looking like they are passed out. Don't always think they are passed out. Take the gun and move it to the other side of the class room so they have to get up and go and get it. By the time they get up someone is most likely tackling them."
"5216","That news reporter was a dick, asking ""when you look at these kids, no you think how easy it is to (kill sound) them?"""

"5220","At my school nobody takes lockdowns seriously. When the principal annouces the lockdown, everyone takes forever to get into the corner, and they'd talk as loud as they want. The kids would laugh and joke, and all of us would sit for five minutes or so and do nothing. I sort of wish my school had police officers scaring children just to knock some sense into my classmates."
"5221","Lol Americans have to do school shooting drills? Just don't allow the market of guns and boom no more school shootings"

We found out later some kids made acid bombs in water bottle"

"5244","my problem with some of the procedures for such drills is that if every classroom closes any such windows and closes lights to make an intruder think there are no students, there is no way in hell a intruder wiuld think all the rooms have no students. now, if retaliation training becomes widespread, then closing the windows make sense for a sneak attack on the intruder. just my two cents."
"5245","just have them carry a gun"
"5246","this is stupid schools should teach kids martial arts or something as a class. my school doesn't teach it but during a drill be baracade the door and climb down the windows with bats in our hand"

Anyways, these practices where the kids hide in corners, silent, and expect them to say,""Oh no one is here, better go to a bar or something..."" seriously, our schools need to take this seriously, possibly doors that lock from the outside and can only be opened by a key or the inside."

"5267","This is why we need to train teachers to have guns in schools."

One day it was just a normal day and we were practicing for a play and then the principal spoke on the P/A and she's like ""This is a lockdown...please keep your children safe.."" and we got behind the desk and hid while the teacher locked the door and turned the lights off,and just a fun fact I had to pee and I had a loose molar. And then a girl whispered to me saying ""This isn't a drill"" and I didn't believe her until my teacher got a phone call from the office and she hung up and then she said ""This is not a drill"" and at that point I was scared.Then just a few minutes after someone tried opening the door and everyone gasped.So after an hour the principal spoke on the P/A and she's like ""The lockdown is over"" and after she announced it my friend and I started crying and hugging each other.And I didn't go to school the next day. And it was for a 'bomb' like why couldn't you send us home earlier we could've EXPLODED WITH IT!!!! And at the end of the year I switched schools..

THE END!"

"5327","none of my teachers could do self-defense shit because 90℅ of my teachers are fat white people"
"5328","when you tell the weird white kid that rubix cubes suck .....0_o"
"5329","Our drill only consists of hiding in the corner. Sometimes we continue our work. What if it was real?"
"5330","This reporter is such a jerk about the training"
"5331","Yeah hide behind the counters because you definitely don't have a better chance of surviving if you all gang up on him."
"5332","bro my shool is dumb asf they would just think its funny and talk but then if it was real they would be crying"
"5333","lol they don't need to train student. call of duty n battlefield will do that for them...mostly. if the kid learns to keep his head down n stay away from the line of sight"
"5334","I had a lock down with two teenagers we stayed there for about 35 minutes and it turned out they had toy guns lol but it was still surprising cause one of our bus drivers outside spotted them....that also happend on valentines day"
"5335","In my school if we ever have a shooter, we're supposed to climb out the windows and just run as far as we can."
"5336","If there were a shooter in my school, no way i'd stay inside. i would jump right through the fucking window"
"5337","No, this is what we need! We need the most realistic lock down drills! They need to be unannounced and they need paintball or pellet guns! Make the drill real!"
"5338","you know a country is fucked when you have school shooter practice"
"5339","My school was under lockdown overnight and it wasn't fun trying to sleep in a squishy position along with 25 other kids not knowing what the fuck was going on."
"5340","Ain't nobody got time for that just Run Forest 🏃 run !!!!!"
"5341","Ok you best believe that if there is a legit lockdown, I'm not going to be in a corner of a room behind a couple desks waiting to be shot in clear site. I'm going to run out of the school, run into the woods and call my parents to pick me up lmao"
"5342","Ur not doing the drills right tbh, I mean if a guy comes in with a gun u don't fucking throw plastic balls at him. Like wtf is that"
"5343","We don't have this problem in Australia"
"5344","when I WAS in middle school there was a lock down because this suspicious guy walked in the building. a teacher arriving to school spoted him looking into cars so she told the principl.. less than a minute dude walks into the school looking into some classrooms.. police was called, our class got the teachers desk and put it in front of the door and we piled up our desk on top.. we turned off the lights and hid... after less than 5 minutes police showed up.. turns out the dude was ""lost"" and was arrested.. the only thing they found on him was knife.. but the scary part is when you hear the alarm go off and the principle say ""THIS IS NOT A DRILL"" it fucking sucks!!!"
"5345","My teachers would be the BEST at this"
"5346","Oh god now I'm afraid to go to Jewett"
"5347","My school don't have a hallway its just open so if there is a lockdown you could hide and not be noticed"
"5348","We had a fire drill, guess where the evactuation place was? The oval. Fire does not go on grass according to my school. ???"
"5349","Dude in Australia at my school we have lockdown drills about every 3 years"
"5350","I guarantee if you try to get up on a live gunman and take his weapon he will blind fire and hit a student by accident and it'll be on you because he might of not shot otherwise."
"5351","But wouldn't the shooter start shooting the gun the moment someone put a hand on them"
"5352","Wouldn't announcing over the intercom ""We are going into lockdown"" alert the shooter kids are there? I've always had this question in my mind"
"5353","the longest was five minutes!?! WHAT the longest one I had was almost 2 hours and that was a drill 😒😂"
"5354","I still have a question why do they block the window if a shooter sees all windows blocked then he will know there is something going on"
"5355","*fire drill goes off* Teacher: GET IN THE CORNER Me: *runs away*"
"5356","So in school the teacher always tells you that if you lock the doors and the lights are off the shooter will think nobody's there and go home. Don't you think after using the same technique for years that one of those shooters is gonna realize its not a coincidence that nobody's ever there? Also, I think students would be much better off jumping out a window or something than huddling in the corner or behind a teachers desk?"
"5357","Hold on y can't teachers have a gun?"
"5358","i had a shooter lockdown like 3 weeks ago but it was across the street from my school which was a pizza place and former employees tried to rob the pizza place, my lockdowns are boring like all we do is sit in a corner and nothing else happens"
"5359","At my school we had an actual shooter and everyone was hiding but I was closest to him and I am a black belt in karate so I jumped up and knocked him out. Then I grabbed the gun and was about to shoot when the police walked in. I was traumatized, and now I can never have a normal life because I know that I almost killed someone! Thank you for listening to my story, I'm gonna go now. Bye. God bless."
"5360","one time we had a serious lockdown because there was a robbery near the school and one of the balloons we were expirimenting with popped and we all screamed because we thought it was a gun"
"5361","this is why pencils are made teach them pencil or scissors defense"
"5362","Kids there is a guy with I gun coming to kill us all!!!! let's  hide behind my wooden desk."
"5363","My school
Fire drill
Earthquake drill
Tornado drill

And then I realise I don't have this drill"
"5364","fuck that jumping out the window"
"5365","........."
"5366","I remember when there was an actual lockdown at my school. It had something to do the somebody in the neighborhood stealing a gun. We were stuck in our rooms for several hours and nobody was allowed to leave. I wasn't scared at the the time and I remember that all I wanted to do was use the bathroom."
"5367","They could hold the gun to their head 😀😀😀😀😀😀"
"5368","we dont do lockdowns anymore"
"5369","I think this is a great idea"
"5370","How you want to know? listen out for someone playing 'Pumped Up Kicks'"
"5371","IT WAS A LOCKDOWN MY FRIENDS WHERE SCARED I JUST LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND STARTED TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING AND I PUT THE SONG ""QUEEN DON'T STOP ME NOW ""........ 2 PEOPLE WHERE SHOT"
"5372","K so I'm commentimg again, because by now that other comment is lost. 

I have a lockdown story.

 One day, I was in school. We had a lockdown assembly (to practice and talk about lockdowns) 30 minutes ago. When we got back to Homeroom, the teacher discussed how to lock the door. We have these NightLock locks that go on the bottom of the door. So after that, The teacher said that there would be a drill next week. Though she said that, the InterCom system interrupted her speaking. 'This is not a drill. Please take cover and lock doors. Lockdown level 2( Lockdown 1 for like animals that are dangerous and Lockdown 2 for shooters) I repeat, Lockdown Level 2. This is not a drill.' I looked at my teacher with an annoyed look on my face, but she was dead serious. I huddled into the corner with all my other classmates.

The same words repeated in my head 'This is not a drill'. Then I heard a loud bang.. It was the classroom next door to us. My stomach churned. One of my classmates was crying, but someone comforted her. I heard a knock on the door, and my vision went blurry. I grabbed a sharpened   pencil, and a pair of scissors, aiming at the door. I must've fainted or something because the last thing I remembered was a loud BANG at the door. I woke up when I hard another BANG, whinch was 10 minutes after. Why hadn't the police come yet? I was so confused. I built up courage to grab my own phone and call 911. I dialed the number, and I heard ' This is 911. Do you need fireman, police, or ambulance?' I answered ' Uh police and an Ambulance' The 911 guy said, 'Location please' I said the location and he said they were on the way. 10 minutes later, I heard a scream and a 'PUT THE GUN DOWN AND YOUR HANDS UP!' woohoo! My call worked. But my thigh ached. I looked, and I saw that when I fainted, I dropped the scissors and they had cut my leg. I clutched it, hoping I could help stop the pain. That made it worse. 'Owch..' I screeched. The InterCom System started  ' The lockdown has lasted an hour and 13 minutes. Three injuries reported so far. Lockdown is over. Please return to your classes.' I could barely stand. My thigh hurt so bad.. I called my teachers name. 'Yes, Sara?' 'Uh...Well...I..Eh...Uhh-' 'What is it?' I showed her my leg, which made everyone gasp. It wasnt the scissors, it was the shooters gunshot. *My mom..* I thought, holding back tears. 'Sara,' My teacher said, ' I'll get an ambulance.' Soon I was in the ambulance, going to the hospital. My mom was there, crying. 'Mom..' I said. I dozed off. When I woke up, the doctor was giving directions to my mom to help me walk. 2 days later, I returned to school. Everyone was happy to see me. Though I was on crutches, they all hugged me. They said they had another lockdown the day before, but it was an animal thank goodness.*Just a drill* I thought, *Just a drill.*

*THIS IS NOT TRUE XP*"
"5373","""A parent's worst nightmare""

Oh, because only the parents matter. I'm about to get fucking shot not my worst nightmare."
"5374","Schools are stupid with this sort of thing. It's just the same thing, every school... hide behind desks, away from windows with the lights off and pretend you're not there... because the shooter totally won't figure that one out after three classrooms, lol. 

Statistically, your odds of surviving are highest (by far) if you run and flee the building, rather than if you hide, since you are just a sitting duck begging to be shot if you hide. Even fighting back (I know, not smart, some people will die), usually has a higher chance of saving you than hiding, since you might catch the killer off guard, and can mob them... overwhelming them with sheer numbers and disarming them, or forcing them to waste too much ammo too fast, and then beating the crap out of them while they reload.

Schools need to stop with this idiotic hiding policy, which was in place for almost every previous shooting (and failed miserablly, getting students and staff shot while they cower under desks), and make hiding a last resort. Immediate evacuation, and fight back training would both have a higher likely hood of success. My recommendation, school/classroom windows which open from the inside, allowing students/staff to flee the building from every room, practiced escape routes and alternative escape routes for those in hallways (including showing any staff exits, or other, non common knowledge, escape routes to students). Some form of last resort non-lethal defense weapons (to be hidden, and locked away by teachers) may be an option as well should you need to make a stand in a classroom (again, everyone dies if you sit under the desks and wait, if you attack the enemy when they kick in the door... most of you will live, especially if the teacher can pull out class tazers or batons from a locked drawer). 

Sitting around doing nothing and crossing your fingets is not a survival tactic... it's a cowards attempt at justifying waiting to die. Hopefully they will realize that fact."
"5375","Lol at my school my class is near the exit so if its a lockdown the teachers lock the doors and we are out in the hall or anything we go out the door and go to Anderson's Candies since its near our school xD"
"5376","the americans have no proper gun law"
"5377","This is why Me and my friends/sisters bring our phones to school so we can be safe"
"5378","weve only ever done bomb drills and everytime they tell us to be wuiet who the fuck is gonna be quiet and walk calmly in a straight line out of a burning building? no one. everyone was laughing pushing each other going on there phones and walking around as if nothing was happening while the headteacher who took them even less then half a street a way ..and started shouting at them for not being quiet while also leadimg them back which took about 15 minutes to get everyone back in through the tiny emergancy exit..."
"5379","Our school does a teach only test (my teacher failed) and then the teachers and kids do 5 rounds one for each things that our teacher says to do
1.  Just hid
2.  Put things in front of the door like desks chairs files etc and hid
3.  Evacuate 
4.  Different room
5.  Put things in front of them door, hid, and grab something to throw

I think it's quite fun..."
"5380","me and my girlfriend were sitting next to each other behind a desk in the corner with just us two she started wanking me off"
"5381","The scariest thing is my school doesn't even practise these! That means that if we have one we're all gonna die lol"
"5382","I've had a 'lockdown' drill similar to this at my school in England"
"5383","They don't do this in my country"
"5384","When my school does lockdown drills , we grab our backpacks and move to one side of the room . After that , we take the most heaviest out of our backpacks (binders , text books, etc.) and get ready to throw them ."
"5385","im happy to know that i dont live there anymore so i dont have to do it"
"5386","one kid had a gun in the middle of school (i was in 8th grade at the time) and we had 7 police cars outside. We were evacuated, and the kid later shot himself."
"5387","In like kindergarten someone threatened our school district that there was a bomb hidden somewhere so yeah that was something I remember"
"5388","my son peed his pants and he is in high school"
"5389","Naomi Metcalf fucking liar"
"5390","Did it save you?"
"5391","nuclearsharkgaming107 LMAO"
"5392","Gavi yaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeehhhh"
"5393","JelloBello! Sara Best story ever in writing one like this now ur inspiring"
"5394","JelloBello! Sara OMG U GOT ME WITH GOOSEBUMPS I THOUGHT THAT WAS REAL OMG"
"5395","Holy shit are you a writer?"
"5396","JelloBello! Sara  knew it!"
"5397","Geviper THANK YOU"
"5398","Because this is directed towards parents/ those who are older than in high school."
"5399","I liked the later part of the video... training for last stand fights, not hiding and waiting for the end. 

Get Rid of duck and cover... start fight or flee!"
"5400","Sarah James but why dont you just call the police instead"
"5401","Slick Savage calling our parents to let them know to they can help"
"5402","Sarah James how is that being safe"
"5403","I stayed calm after that"
"5404","Pikachu gamer 05 noo it's too risky but I mean if ur smart jump out the fucking window grab something hide behind the window when he comes turn into HARAMBE MODE AND KILL THE SHIT OUT OF THEM"
"5405","DJScraps18 lies"
"5406","GR3G 1NAT0R I got shot from a shooter at my school.







I beat the living fucking hell out of him and I saved the day"
"5407","I live in England but if this shit ever happened (you can still own guns, just not carry them) I'd be jumping out the fucking window, grabbing a few brownies from the cafeteria (im obviously going to make use of the situation) and gtfoing"
"5408","GR3G 1NAT0R no just grab the scissors and throw them at the shooters head and kill em"
"5409","because of the drill"
"5410","Holly ducking shut these white kids are fuming pussies this is bull shit 
if her man was going 100 mph how the fuck did he not get a ticket if I was going 100 mph I would get shot fuck this bull shit white people are ducking pussies it's a fucking drill and this shit will save your life
the guy screaming that at kindagardeners thing was a bit much tho but 3 grade and up bitch man up"
"5411","OMG!!! THATS MY SCHOOL!!!!! I had no idea this was happening! It probably happened right after I moved"
"5412","We had a real one and it was so scary because there was a guy like right behind my school"
"5413","Hiding in a corner isn't going to help! That's a better way to get killed! Climb through the window or something"
"5414","3:06 
That teacher be lying tho"
"5415","My school says that in the event of an active shooter we're supposed to do the opposite of a lockdown and get off campus. But then what are lockdowns for??"
"5416","The two teachers I felt most safe with, one in sixth grade, the other in seventh, literally just told us, ""I'm sorry, but if this was real, I'd want us to fight back."" My school doesn't have these, so we kinda chuckled, and after we discussed how we'd fight back (this was the 6th grade US studies teacher) and we said that we'd run at them with the tree saw that he had for a unit. My other teacher said she'd encourage us to grab one of those literature books and arm ourselves. I mean imagine getting hit by 25-30 literature books in the head."
"5417","How come we hide in the corner, of the shooter knows it's a school day and there would be kids?"
"5418","I am the strongest kid in the school, so what I did during a shooting is I hid behind the door (teacher let me), and I grabbed the shooters arm and snapped it. It was pretty satisfying."
"5419","""His dad raced to his school""


Drives slow"
"5420","At my school they just hide us in a corner"
"5421","I'm from the UK and I can't believe this is a thing that actually has to happen in American schools. I don't understand how any decent person can justify how relaxed gun laws are the availibility of them when there is a school shooting on average every month KILLING KIDS!!

And whats the answer for these people? Have the kids practice getting shot!!! If theres a shooting close the blind, huddle together and hope not to die! This would scare the shit out of anyone because unlike a fire drill where you're taught how to actually survive this seems to be teaching how to edge your bets while youre still in serious danger because your country has failed you. 

THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM IN A COUNTRY LIKE AMERICA

get your shit together, seriously"
"5422","I'm glad my school shooting  drills aren't as bad as that"
"5423","omg holly is sooo good at that"
"5424","Damn im proud of her. :D"
"5425","I think the school is doing the right thing I mean when somebody comes to your school with machine guns they don't tell you that their coming to kill you"
"5426","I wish my school did these 😧"
"5427","They did studies on the tactic of everybody grouping in the same corner and there is a 1 in 30 chance of survival  it's better to spread so the shooter has to turn more times and the students would be able to disar escape from or attack the shooter"
"5428","This training is putting anyone in more danger.A 200 pound gunman can easily kill a 100 pound person."
"5429","they tell us to hide under the desk like bitch im throwing a desk at the window and breaking out"
"5430","You don't get this shit in the uk"
"5431","That's so stupid. What if the teacher is shot? Doesn't that mean that the kids also need to know how to take them down."
"5432","*damn*. in my school all we do is go in a corner and the janitors knock on the doors. and I go to a *military base*. I wish my school hired actors and brought weapons"
"5433","this is not trying to be rastist but  maybe they should ban guns for the public,it should be better for the future"
"5434","Shouldn't have put it on TV.
Now they know their tactics."
"5435","Just tackle him he'll Be held down and beaten up"
"5436","There is a 1/1000000000 chance this will happen."
"5437","*Beautiful Monday morning*

School shooter- (walks into the school) it's time to get those lil'dirtbags! 
Teacher- (silent whisper) get down kids!

"5439","Ah America! Still not considering banning guns?"
"5440","always keep an ak 47 under your desk and a pistol"
"5441","We had a lockdown in our school because there was a shooter in our school. We were told not to use our electronic devices, be near a window or make any noises. in the end everyone was doing what we were not suppose to be doing."
"5442","At 0:23 you can see minions all over the lockers, I guess the shooter had a reason."
"5443","my teacher has a bat under her  desk"
"5444","A good Idea is to arm teachers with guns not karate."
"5445","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet"
"5446","This video is always in my recommended. I've taken it off, watched it, and refreshed."
"5447","can't you just go outside and run away. even though everyone gets killed.."
"5448","I had a third grade teacher who was hella old.Amost 70, and she had been teaching at my school for like 40 years but that shool had just began to do those drills so my teacher didn't know too much about the.So, it was a lock down day and our office lady had told he teachers the day before that there was going to be a drill.They wanted to pretend like it was a real drill, although it was fake.And only the staff and teachers knew about this.So office lady yell into the speaker,""this is not a drill, we are in lockdown"".so we all run to the back of the class and hide.Our teacher apparently didn't know what 'lockdown' meant cuz as soon as we heard banging on the doors, she got up confused and opened the damm door.She just stood there so confused and yelled at the man(that was pretending to be a shooter)""heyy!I'm trying to teach a class here!!What do you want"".And then turned to us also very confused on why we were all hiding.She was such a funny teacher😂😂😂"
"5449","Hell"
"5450","Man I'm glad I live in Sweden"
"5451","the thing is its so simple...
just make it so if you're mentally unstable you cant own a gun. just make them pass an exam or something..."
"5452","here in the UK you can blare pumped up kicks without getting suspended..."
"5453","""all the other kids with the pumped up kicks..."""
"5454","YEAH LETS JUST GROUP ALL 20 KIDS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM! GREAT PLAN!!"
"5455","How the fuck are foam balls gonna do anything"
"5456","wtf that countries so fucked up if kids have to be taught what to do in a shooting"
"5457","Or put extra locks on the insides of the classroom doors?
All the doors were unlocked in these scenarios and everyone was literally sitting ducks. much easier to shoot people all in a group.
If the attacker cant get in the room then your sound.

If it was up to me, Id have fog machines fitted into all the ceilings filled with sleeping gas, as soon as the building goes into lock down, the doors get sealed and double/triple locked from the inside and the halls get filled with sleeping gas. the attacker goes down and the police do their thing. simples"
"5458","I mean you could always have windows and jump out
"
"5459","And they said it's dangerous for students to bring guns to school"
"5460","""These drills might be too frightening"", I laughed when they said that because I wasn't even a real school shot."
"5461","Sometimes there is a fire emergency test announcement because we need to practice if there is really gonna be a fire at my school. So when the alarm goes off I one time jumped out of the window and I broke my arm because I was scared. I just hate it when the announcement is heard it's our principal's voice. I don't know why but I think the principal's voice is a mean female voice."
"5462","My school got shot up and I took down the school shooter, this drill is useless"
"5463","I don't get why the class all gets crowded in one corner. If the shooter gets in sees the kid, not enough room to dodge, very slim chance of the bullet missing, and not a lot are getting  out of there. spread out so you can overwhelm him from the back or just each choose a desk to hide."
"5464","Last year there were 3 drill lockdowns in my school, It was really scary because everyone thought that it was real and one of the teachers started shouting outside the door. it was a drill"
"5465","This is why cirten schools have metle detectors to prevent this."
"5466","i would go to the hallway and find the shooter and stand in front of them and yell SHOOT MEEEEE NOOOOOOW"
"5467","We were having a drill and my best friend got his phone out and played pumped up kicks on full volume. He got suspended"
"5468","So now the shooters that are students know where everyone hides lol"
"5469","I had a real lockdown because there was a loose dog"
"5470","I had a drill once at my school and since I'm a diabetic with a glucose monitor, it started buzzing because the transmitter wasn't working right, and the teacher thought it was my phone and he was pissed as fuck. For the rest of the class he made us all be quiet. He was a substitute by the way."
"5471","Or just get a secret compartment in you're classroom."
"5472","this is amazing"
"5473","About a month after Sandy Hook my school did a lock down drill. But my stupid ass thought it was for real, jumped out the window, and I made a run for it! (I wasn't dying young, broken arms from the fall are temporary, suspensions are temporary, death from a gun is permanent.)"
"5474","Last year there was a murder on the loose in my town so we went on a hard lock down and everyone was so scared calling their parents and shit like this is why we need these kind of drills bc if it really happens we need to be prepared not sitting scared in the corner"
"5475","just the first few seconds made my heart beat accelerate"
"5476","in 3rd grade our drill was hiding in a closet and readong"
"5477","Back in high school we'd barricade the shit out of the door"
"5478","the reason we dont have this at my school is because we are all hispanics bro 😂😂😂"
"5479","I wad in 2 grd when a shooter came in my school and i was at the front of the school... then the swat came in and tased him i was freaked then the i got on the news and hugged the police man that saved my life...then there was another one where i threw a chair at a guy that busted into my class it was a drill but i broke his skull and he got 10 stitches that was terrifying... and i dont want that images so i want PEPOLE TO DRINK ME"
"5480","when the fire alarm goes off in my school
I scream and jump in someone's arm"
"5481","don't make it a gun free zone"
"5482","omg I live in colorado"
"5483","remember kids don't play 'drop the bass' during a shooting or the gunman will randomly be doing the worm"
"5484","It's kinda scary, huh?
No Sherlock, it's a party up in here!"
"5485","Fuck her right in the pussy."
"5486","give teachers guns, problem solved. 12+ teachers with guns vs 1 or 2 school shooters. ezpz lemon squeezy"
"5487","I would fight for my life and my friend.  Not be a sitting duck."
"5488","my school needs this kind of drill"
"5489","""HEY THEY'RE IN HERE""
""Thanks, I'll kill you last"""
"5490","wow america this is really sad that u actually need to do drills for shootings... just ban guns sure few years of unrest but just harsh treatment with sticks"
"5491","tbh hiding a whole class behind a few desks isn't going to save the kids you need to space out the kids because the kids are see able from birds eye view inside and plus the gun shooter isn't going to say anything just shoot those they see so you wouldn't even be aware but not going to lie atleast you're trying"
"5492","Oh yes! Huddle everyone in a corner so once 1 person is shot, everyone else is stuck and they die as well..."
"5493","In my school we have these chains where we hook the door on to the wall next to it so its harder for someone to come in"
"5494","my school has a design tech lab with knives and saws - if i have a lockdown i hope my ass will be there imma kill the shooter lololololololololololololol"
"5495","I am so sorry to say this but the more you do the drills that make the kids think it's real the kids get use to it and when there is a normal shooting they will think it's a drill."
"5496","if it were my school we'd jump that school shooter staying next to door and beat the HELL OUT OF THEM STEAL THEIR GUN AND SHOOT THE LAST ONE IN THE LEG"
"5497","my favorite part was when they just jumped any attacked the shooter"
"5498","they should teach the kids defence too.  makes no sense to leave them defenseless."
"5499","I'm white so I'll just take out the m4"
"5500","what happens in a school shooting-we all sit in a corner and if the shooter comes in,we are all dead *IS THAT ALL THE SCHOOL DOES?*"
"5501","Do people really think tackling the shooter is gonna work? everyone in the class would be dead"
"5502","What if it really happens and the kids think its a drill then the shooter will really shoot a bullet and teacher will be too scared to react and eventually some one will die"
"5503","well thats america for ya"
"5504","At a tornado drill I heard some kindergartens crying and even I a fifth grader is terrified! Just like the rest of my class"
"5505","One time we had an unexpected drill where they never said it was a drill. My friends and i were in english class second period and we heard ""Hard lockdown Panic button activated"" in a robotic voice over the intercom. 

My friends and i told the teacher that we wouldnt be a statistic because she had no idea either.

that is the fastest ive ran in my life."
"5506","Just keep a 12 gauge in your bag"
"5507","only in america"
"5508","In the last part, if it was real, he would have hurt her when he was first struggling & fixated on his gun.
Also, vested interest -if she fails, the business looks just about useless."
"5509","Why not just make the teachers concealed carry?"
"5510","Nicholas Conway acually I'm not. The schools in Colorado. The teacher that was in the video was named Holly and one of the other teacher was was the Spanish theacher. One of the kids was my sisters be, Tyler s. If you don't believe me then don't. I know my stuff and you know what u know. That was my school and I am not lying. You may not believe me but I'm not lying. Fun fact, in 2013, a high school student set off a chemical bomb and everyone had to go out side. The kid who set it off the chemical bomb went to jail and his friend who knew about it was suspended. It was my school and I am not a lier."
"5511","Braidy parrill you are the biggest liar"
"5512","There have been many cases where there are more shooters waiting outside for people to come out to kill. I think I heard about a school in ohio where that happened."
"5513","I know man, but it be fight or flight, not hide in a corner like a coward"
"5514","eG Tesla there distract other people jump and tackle him"
"5515","gotta look good on cam for better public exposure"
"5516","im weeee"
"5517","Vlog Life i bet she be thinking which one will i fuck first"
"5518","Jo-Ann Stokell yeah but the thing is if your huddled up it just helps the shooter kill more kids I believe being spread out is better"
"5519","Ines Cases-Falque terrorist attacks Jesus never would of thought that."
"5520","I live in England and we have lockdown drills for shootings or terrorist attacks."
"5521","Marco Paez ooo"
"5522","Marco Paez the shooter went to school to so the know the drill so I always get confused"
"5523","Marco Paez I"
"5524","at my school we had one and my teacher was like fuck this she grabbed a brick what she brings just in case smashed a window and was like come on kids me and my twin sister was like ok bye edgy teen who wants me and everyone else dead for no reason"
"5525","also, school shooters normally are students who go through lockdown drills and understand the procedures."
"5526","Nicholas Conway This has been happenning before Trump!"
"5527","James van Arnhem we have trump... what do you expect"
"5528","One time when our class was doing a drill, every kid screamed super loud and the teachers so angry at us."
"5529","snap their necks and use their carcasses as body shields. you must be the only one to survive."
"5530","Carla Secrets lmao"
"5531","didn't expect leaderlords here!"
"5532","TheUndertale Fanatic The bullies would probably shot there fucking prey."
"5533","Yeah but guns are better"
"5534","TheUndertale Fanatic I bring a knife to school is that better"
"5535","Yeah and I'm pretty sure if they allowed that, next thing you know, some psychotic student brings his handgun and starts shooting at people."
"5536","What are you, an anime character? And with a shitty name too."
"5537","Yandere Chan your spelling is a bit off"
"5538","....?????? seriously?"
"5539","*reading"
"5540","same"
"5541","I think the training is pointless as the shooter will most likely not point out a small gun but rather start shooting and kill everyone.Also they might come in more than one person trying to shoot the school."
"5542","man wished they did some of this at berrendo..."
"5543","My school used to do this drill a lot but they don't do it but like 3 times a year now"
"5544","Gosh Guys I'm Really Scared For That In My School Oh Hell No I Don't Like That That Rude People I Hate Lockdowns I get Soo Scared When That Bublling Sound Like If You Agree 5 Minutes I A Lot Okay Bye"
"5545","If anyone here God forbid is ever in a school shooting or something like that, don't hide, run. You don't even have to know where your running just run as far and fast as possible."
"5546","Good. Kids need to know this shit and how to protect themselves .. this country is full of wusses .. ugh."
"5547","I wanted my classroom to vote if we should to be taught self defense in case of a lockdown or shooting and I only said yes everyone else said that it's ""too scary"" I'm like what the heck?!"
"5548","My school's prep for a school shooter is put paper on the windows and lock the doors if the lock even works. Mother fuckers I'm pretty sure if a shooter sees paper over the door they probably won't be like ""oh shit, there must be nobody in there at all"""
"5549","6:19 haha i would of just bit him dont you think that would of been much easier? lol"
"5550","Active school shootings, is there such thing as inactive school shootings?"
"5551","if they have suprise drills then how will they now if its a real shooter?"
"5552","Fuck niggers"
"5553","I say they just paint Airsoft guns tips off and get a gun with tons of gas shooting out."
"5554","when the teachers were practicing fighting and they guy started ""fighting"" back... his other arm was completely free..."
"5555","when the school shooter  finds you,  but u breaks his ankles"
"5556","I did like how they taught the teachers self defense lol.  And how they taught the kids when the shooter is reloading.  A lot better than sitting on ur ass behind a desk scared."
"5557","that's all they do lock the doors and close the blinds?!? at my school my teacher gets all of the chairs desks and shoves them against the door  and windows. we also open the windows then open the gate and then go to a house or a manchan and stay in there garage 
AND WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE"
"5558","they showed my school the timony"
"5559","I remember I was in a school shooting drill and we were in a chem Lab so the guy came in and a kid just started beating him with a fire extinguisher"
"5560","At my school the principal walks around and tugs on the door then leaves, so nothing big. That is just  ridiculous."
"5561","I'd actually rather hide in a toilet block than hide in a classroom that obviously the shooter is going to know that it  has a room full of kids in it."
"5562","why was this in my recomended"
"5563","These people think hiding behind a desk is gonna protect from bullets? I'm mean hell, the constitution is paper and it's never stopped our current administration."
"5564","im in tenth grade and in my classes I always sit in-front of the door cause of the assigned seets and their are windows beside all the doors so in a lock down drill I stick out  if their was a shooter he would see me as soon as he walked by the door , its great knowing that I would die first"
"5565","Wait! There are school shooting drills? American need to do something "
"5566","0:50 look near the cars....hi.....you'll get what I mean"
"5567","At my school we had a drill and instead of hiding and being gunned down we had to barricade the doors and fight back"
"5568","if someone comes into our school grounds with a gun, I'm not hiding behind a fucking desks I'm gonna use a lanky wanker as a sheild and run the fuck away"
"5569","They are learning how to take down a shooter but what if there are 2 or 3 shooters"
"5570","Meanwhile my high school had a couple resource officers walking around with loaded pistols on their hips in case of shooters. Maybe not give the teachers guns but have a few police on site?"
"5571","If my local shooter walks into my school on Tuesday decides to shoot some kids and sees the classroom lights are off, that ain't doing shit."
"5572","My brother was on lock down bc his friend probably had a fun or knife. The cops were called. I was really scared. I am in 5th grade and he is in 11th.  But his friend did not have a gun. some one else did probably."
"5573","Sitting ducks: 
*guy comes in* 
Guy: BAM!! YOU'ER ALL DEAD, NEXT!!"
"5574","During a lock-down, in complete silence, my friend just randomly said ""SKINNY PENIS"" in a stern voice."
"5575","I think its smart"
"5576","like when you huddle with all your classmates in a corner in the room and putting a peace of paper over the window in the door it makes it so much easier for them kill u like and under the desk there is no where for u to run like if any teacher is seeing this maybe you should have something in your room in case an actual shooter came in (as a last resort situation obiously) bc imagaine you getting a call home from the school saying that ur child died bc their little safety procedure wasn't effective enough"
"5577","WITHOUT WARNING! FUCK NOOOOOOOOOO!! That's like PTSD city."
"5578","this is the thing if they break into the room everyone sits in the corner of the room waiting to die if they break in. that what I hate about those drills but this one is like 1 out of like 100000 schools that get this ""training"" just so it looks good on media"
"5579","makes me feel sad -.-"
"5580","WELL! we got 100 hundred people, been trained to face a situation like that! i think would be easier avoid the fuckin'  TWO GUYZ SHOOTING KKKKKK SYSTEM FAILED!!!!"
"5581","loooooooooooooooooooool"
"5582","Dumb fucks who think gun laws will solve anything..CRIMINALS DON'T LISTEN TO LAWS YOU IDIOTS"
"5583","BRUUUHHHH these drills are awsome all we have to do is turn off all the lights and be quite."
"5584","Pussies :l"
"5585","This is why I'm happy to live in canada"
"5586","In the United Kingdom we don't have these drills, why is that?"
"5587","if this was real id grab a chair or math book throw it at the shooter than grab the object and bang it against there spine or head.."
"5588","3:50 Rember Kids always throw your balls at the shooter."
"5589","When I was in 3rd grade my teacher told us boys get to stab the guy with pencils and scissors and girls throw pencil boxes and toys at them... I think we would kill them like some kid will choke them with a jump rope or something😂😂😂"
"5590","I feel like more people would die if they followed this drill...."
"5591","We had a lock down like the first one were the guy with the fake gun comes in to the classroom and my mate ran full pelt at the guy with the gun holding a chair and armed him into the wall"
"5592","bitch they just make you sit in a corner"
"5593","Yea hiding under a desk will help smh so stupid"
"5594","Yea just fucking get in a group to make an easier target. Oh if you dont want shot by the school shooter, be the school shooter."
"5595","When the school shooter gets shot so you pick up his gun and finish what he started"
"5596","they should more unannounced drills cause the real thing can happen at any momment but not go THAT far"
"5597","We had a lockdown in my fourth grade school. It wasn't a drill. A school not too far from mine saw a man on school grounds with a gun. They told all schools in the area to lockdown. Needless to say, I sprinted home."
"5598","Ok cool colorado"
"5599","I'd do the gun grab thing then bite they're arm till I taste blood"
"5600","I remember the there was a lock down drill when I was in 1st grade, the teachers didn't do shit. Good thing it was just a senior from the high school nearby."
"5601","Only in America..."
"5602","the kids at my school are dumb they talk when we are doing a drill and they don't tell us if it's real or not so they will get us killed!!!!!"
"5603","If your literally acting it out realistically your going to far but yes it's good to prepare but to make it realistic as possible would scare the $h;t out of the children"
"5604","I had one before
cops shot through window s at us because there was a guy who was in my classroom  and had a gun and threatened us all one kid thru sicors at him the guy shot my friend I miss him😭 the police came in with the FBI and killed the shooter"
"5605","people who say that haven't been through it the pain of a real gunshot so they can't really say anything about it"
"5606","Drill:k nothing will happen
Reality:RUN FOR YOUR FUCKEN LIFES CHILDREN!"
"5607","Bruh instead of hiding, if the shooter comes in the room, kids need to fucking scatter because 30 kids sitting behind a desk isn't helpful."
"5608","Bruh I live in Florida all they did was wiggle the door knob and shit and then walk  away like wtf"
"5609","wtf?  they are literally ASKING to die if they are all sitting next to each other , even if my school made me do that ima fucking run."
"5610","that teacher is hot"
"5611","Bitch I Stabbed An Officer Cause He Came In With His Gun *He Was Not In Uniform*"
"5612","It's just a prank bro."
"5613","Columbine was a social experiment gone sexual"
"5614","I think they should do this at every American school"
"5615","The fat ass teachers at my school wouldn't stand a chance trying to take down a shooter"
"5616","ayy bro watch your gun watch your gun WATCH YOUR GUN"
"5617","these drills are stupid in the fact that you have to stand still and wait. if i was in the real thing i would try to leave and run because  sitting still is like a sitting duck"
"5618","That awkward moment when you walk in that gym and you see your teacher kick the butt of some guy with a gun"
"5619","*Plays Pumped Up Kicks*"
"5620","My school has had ONE lockdown this entire school year. They didn't make us hide at all they just said to close the blinds :/"
"5621","You shouldn't put kids in a class so a shooter can come in like a wolf in a chicken coop have them have a way out get them out of there for gods sake get the hell out a lock door won't stop a fucking gun the staff of schools need to learn get you kids out window whatever just get the fuck out"
"5622","lock downs are a stupid idea the person in the school knows that its a lock down so they are gonna break the door then everyone dies so you would need to barricade the door and if your class has no window well..... YOUR FUCKED"
"5623","I think the teacher broke his arm"
"5624","In 5th grade, we had a drill like this but they didn't tell us and our teacher wasn't in the room, so we all had to do what we knew and hid in the corner, we heard yelling and banging. On the doors, we were all told later that day, that a mentel. Illness man was in our building and wanting to kill us.but they arrested him and he only had a knife, but no one was injured or killed"
"5625","That teacher is awesome."
"5626","A shooter walks through the hallway and has a gun and sees a classroom and he looks in and the light is off and he says well the students are not here....Well naw dip that is the first place the killer looks in a school"
"5627","I had a bomb threat at my school 2 years ago"
"5628","i watch too much walking dead and play too much shooting games im an expert of what to do in this situation,
in the walking dead, they're like ""hey dood we can work this out ok"" then approach them while speaking, then bring out their machete and stab them, and i know  to grab a piece of glass or like a  picture frame and hide it in my pocket,"
"5629","Let's put everyone in one group and let the shooter have a chance to shoot us all"
"5630","*30 people sit behind a desk and a shooter comes in* 
Shooter: oh well I guess nobody is here, I'll just leave

.... yeah right"
"5631","That's why for my birthday i want to get a pocket knife to bring to school..."
"5632","im pullin a Usain Bolt if this was real No Lie"
"5633","""My husband got a ticket for doing 130"" No really"
"5634","in a gun drill why don't they put the tables in front of the door it word help alot so the guy or guys can't get in?!"
"5635","one time we were having a lockdown (drill) and  my phone went off and the teacher sent me out but nobody knew it was a drill so that teacher no longer teaches 5th grade math class"
"5636","* Run *"
"5637","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 😂😂😂😂😂"
"5638","anyone else's worst fear for these being in the bathroom while it happens"
"5639","I'll never experience this because I'm Irish in Ireland"
"5640","Wtf?? Unannounced drills are just asking for trouble. An armed police officer in all black kicks the door in, I'm sure that the asthmatic kid or the kid with heart issues is going to be super chill. And while we're at it, why not teach them to throw themselves at an active shooter?"
"5641","DatCatStudios OFFICIAL you are a fucking idiot."
"5642","coolie courage suck_yuh_mudda savage"
"5643","coolie courage suck_yuh_mudda lol"
"5644","look at how the teachers tackle the police"
"5645","ThE GUy same"
"5646","Hm Hm same"
"5647","That Sounds like something I would want to do 😂"
"5648","ThE GUy BEST SCHOOL THAT TRAINS TEACHERS TO TELL KIDS TO CHOKE AND THROW STUFF AT BAD GUYS."
"5649","EZ and JACK 😂😂😂 ok"
"5650","if there's ever a shooter in my school I'm screwed all of the classrooms in a hallway are connected by doors that don't lock"
"5651","i remember once we had a real lock down because there was a fight and the school a man running at the school was armed so teachers thought this was real and remember my teacher grabbing a pair of scissors and siting by the door"
"5652","thats the normal drills we have????"
"5653","Dirk Strider what iin the fuck ii2 wrong wiith you human2?"
"5654","Dirk Strider 
The cameras right there, bro."
"5655","Danielle Koch gone sexual"
"5656","PRANK IN THE HOOD (GONE WRONG!!!) SCHOOL SHOOTER PRANK! (BLOOD!!)"
"5657","Yandere Chan said... yandere chan"
"5658","ProtoOnPC because you're joking around about a terrible tragedy"
"5659","EZ and JACK why would you feel bad?"
"5660","ProtoOnPC I feel bad for laughing at your comment"
"5661","+Firosniper123 thats alot better than sitting in the corner admitting your defeat, good job my man"
"5662","Mr.ManMakesLotsOfCan just fucking kick em in da balls"
"5663","Mr.ManMakesLotsOfCan ikr"
"5664","lol its funny they will obviously see you in the corner of  the class, that's why i'd try to stop him behind the door"
"5665","Nadlin Riche yup"
"5666","stay alive crouche"
"5667","Nadlin Riche lmao"
"5668","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS, YOU'D BETTER RUN, BETTER RUN. FASTER THAN MY BULLET"
"5669","Why tf are the parents coming to the school? Your dumbass is just causing more problems... the police can't even get to the school now because all the parents think their actually going to do something and stop the shooter by themselves..  fucking pathetic"
"5670","If you can get close range stab. Them with a pencil or scissors"
"5671","in preschool I remember there was a hard lock down and going in the cabinet for my safety and seeing the guy with the gun get tasered and everyone was crying, and me"
"5672","if you do this so much that kid's aren't scared anymore, they will not have the proper reaction if there actually is a shooter"
"5673","I've volunteered for active shooter training where I played dead in the hallways but it was practice for the police officers, not the students."
"5674","Yep TIME TO TRAUMATIZE KIDS BY MAKING THEM SHIT THIER PANTS"
"5675","Pushies ( I know I spelt it wrong)"
"5676","my teacher basically wants me to die,she tells me to go to her desk when I can be seen instantly! And I'm like WTF TEACHER!"
"5677","Ik that the drills help to hide them but like if this actually happens won't the intruders know that the everyone is hiding and is there"
"5678","If a shooter went to my school I am in a mobile unit ( thin and weak doors ) so I will just try to stab the person"
"5679","All the other kids"
"5680","i wanna get homeschooled now😢"
"5681","if the shooter was shorter than me (I'm the tallest) and my classmates I would tell them wear their black or grey sweaters and camouflage then get our math books and wait till the shooter comes in and attack his ass it would be better if the whole school and teachers do it"
"5682","These people are fucking idiots if a gun man is in the school he won't stand still and wait for you to take you down you would be fucking dead"
"5683","what if i wanna play 'pumped up kicks'?"
"5684","Our math teacher from middle school  told us that some years ago the school was having a drill but accidently said ""this is not a drill"" he said that students instead of doing the drill they ran and scream even teachers😂😂😂"
"5685","and i want to be a  techer"
"5686","my name is holly"
"5687","if they continuously do drills like this on a regular basis, this will be just another fire drill. and let us all face reality for one second please, no person of ordinary care and judgement finds schoolfire drill real or serious anymore."
"5688","honestly if this is thier strategy to counter school shootings, they are just making it easier for the shooter to target a massive group of potential victims if they all huddled up in a corner. all the shooter have to to is shoot out the window to the door (and majority of elementry schools have windows in thier doors) and just look for the group huddle and randomly fire at the mass of huddled people. this tactic is genuinely retarded."
"5689","Lol what a fucked up country."
"5690","On my second day of high school we had a bomb scare for 2-3 hours and boy it was fun I made so many friends. Some were shitting themselves lol"
"5691","5 minutes? Ours usually go on for 30 mins or more"
"5692","WE ARE GOING ON LOCKDOWN. * turns on pumped up kicks* *everyone looks at me* What? this is my shit."
"5693","I acutly remember seeing this once. I only saw the part where the kid said ""to practice safety or something"" then changed the channel"
"5694","*Talks when on lockdown*

My class would be horrible during a lockdown, there laughing and using phones and everythi- 

*Entire class staring at me*

You heard me bitches"
"5695","When we do this, most kids do not do this, when we did it most were talking and 2 students were playing rock, paper, scissors. I think that this could be very well if they notify the parent so that they do not get so scared about it."
"5696","Well if the intruder comes in to a class and he drops he's gun on accident pick It up and shoot him in the kee"
"5697","Wonder if this will happen to my school"
"5698","In my school all everyone says is ""If this were a real shooting we'd all be dead"" *fart noises* *cough cough* ""Omg stfu"" people sitting in the corner and gossiping."
"5699","me and my friends will plan will try and learn how to disarm a shooter and possibly how to jump them."
"5700","in my school we dont even have these drills... should i be concerned? xx"
"5701","at my school when they do a lockdown drill the Telus on the overhead we are not going to have a lockdown drill and stuff comes by trying to open the doors to see if they're locked or not"
"5702","if theres ever a school shooter at my school im not gonna be hiding in the corner waiting for him to get in im gonna be right by the door with a book or some heavy ass shit to attack him with any people will reply ""your lying"" ""yeah right"" etc... but ive been trained to fight and im not gonna sit still waiting to get shot and if he does end up killing me then i died trying to save lives and thats somethign id be proud to take to my grave"
"5703","just fucking baricade the door so the Schooter cant come in XD"
"5704","She saw a cop with a gun and thought that the cop was gonna kill her. You fucking stupid 6th graders need to get a fucking life because a real school shooter would force you to suck his dick."
"5705","I remember once I was in middle school and a high schoolers reported a shooting in the high school. And since the high school is next to the middle school the middle school had a lockdown. Everyone include me almost had a heart attack. Thank fully there was no signs of shooting."
"5706","when I was in second grade, i had a lockdown and the teacher closed the hurricane shutters on the windows (Florida schools sometimes have cranking window shutters) and we watched a movie. four years later, I'm finding out it was a lockdown. We were just chilling and sitting at our desks.. wth"
"5707","Honestly I don't want anyone to die and I think school shootings are super fucked up but how is EVERYONE hiding behind a desk safer than EVERYONE hiding behind the door ready to jump on the school shooters bitch ass?"
"5708","If the kids did that they would have beaten the crap out of him"
"5709","Grabbing the gun could actually set it off and possibly shoot the children."
"5710","this is terrifying"
"5711","if i had to pracrice i would ask if the ambulance is here"
"5712","You think im gonna go sit in the corner and wait for that guy to shoot our door in and magdump everyone sitting there?"
"5713","If the parents don't like the idea of their kids being shot at, real or fake, they should probably start urging their politicians to legislate gun control. Until that happens, the schools need to do whatever they can to drill into students that you may well die on a school premises and at best the gun lobbyists will use your deaths to suggests you need more guns. That or just say the whole thing was fake."
"5714","0:50 thug life bitches"
"5715","Why don't America just ban guns"
"5716","At my school that I know of is that we haven't had a shooting but we've had strangers come into my school and it wasn't a drill or nothing."
"5717","Anyone else find themselves in the weird part of youtube again?"
"5718","This is outstanding to know that some schools actually have this kind of program!😀 I do kinda see where the man is going towards when he said a ""it's just putting them in more danger"" because if they fight back, it's just giving them more of a risk to get hurt. But it's better to know that schools are at least prepared and trained if they need to take action. I fully support this program! I am a 5th grade student myself. I wish that my school would have these things. But I took self defense classes, and have a bunch of dictionaries, and that stuff in our class. I really like this video!"
"5719","I had a real lockdown a few weeks ago, and we had to sit there for a half hour.  They said that there was a suspicious person walking around the elementary school right next to us.  I am in a middle school."
"5720","3:50 throwing balls at someone that has a gun? Hahah this school is so stupid"
"5721","i wish they did that in my school."
"5722","The thing is if they keep doing that then if there's a real shooting they will just think ""oh it's just a drill"""
"5723","I wish that they would focus on this type of drill as much as fire drills."
"5724","I get playing dead is smart but what if a shooter just felt like shooter a body continuously for fun then the person playing dead would die"
"5725","*pumped up kicks*"
"5726","I wish we could have these types of drills at my school. Not only is it very important, but it gives kind of like a rush, which is fun."
"5727","i WENT THROUGH ONE IN OCTOBER THE SCARIEST THING EVER!
ECSPECIALLY FOR A GRADE SCHOOL CHILD

we had to hide in the corner and the shooters 
some highschoolers were acting screaming groaning so scary

then we run outside to the feild behind a house that was being bulit"
"5728","wtf would the principal say ""Ok school we're doing the lockdown""
the shooter just gonna know that the school is doing a lockdown lol"
"5729","All we did was learn to not stay in one place and just throw anything at the shooter.."
"5730","nice to see people are trying to get away from what I really experienced 😊"
"5731","When we have a lockdown drill the boys make jokes and fart noises and everyone laughs it's pretty bad.  Our class got in trouble."
"5732","3:21 the kid all the way in the back 😂😂😂"
"5733","When the one girl had to do it agin and he gut was going to fight back a little I was like GO BICH GO BICH"
"5734","the teacher's hawt * lenny *"
"5735","Yass Colorado"
"5736","what if juggs come in the school"
"5737","in real life she gets shot"
"5738","at my school we support Rachel's challenge and I think it was a very sad time for calebine"
"5739","she held 
him long enough he would have got jumped"
"5740","5 min my longest was 20-25 minutes"
"5741","Who has a blind on their door?!? My school doesn't."
"5742","In my school we had a lock down in 6th grade like 4 or 3 years ago and for the teacher just to make us quiet he let us play on laptops"
"5743","What kind of 11 year old has a phone?"
"5744","Hey everyone someone is out to kill us let's be smart and gather up in the corner for when they come in it will be easier to kill all of us"
"5745","I had a drill and it lasted for an hour
idk why but our school is very protective"
"5746","In the US the laws need to be strict. I live in Canada and you just need a permit to have one. But in the U.K. nobody has guns at all, not even police, only the higher ranked officers do. I think we should have that in North America. Then there will be less killings."
"5747","""All the other kids with the pumped up kicks..."""
"5748","Another reason I would homeschool my child in the future..."
"5749","We should do a 9/11 drill, and one guy dressed as Osama Binladin runs in with a bomb vest XD lmfao"
"5750","I wanna do these lol"
"5751","People in the comments are saying ""why don't you just ban guns."" You do know there is a thing called the black market right?It is incredibly easy to get a gun there."
"5752","we did on when i was in p2 which america you call grade 1 and they made someone walk around the shool with a nife we only out our heads down on the table and the teacher played on her computer 😑"
"5753","if there was a school shooter in my school boi fuck the "" hide under my desk "" IMMA JUMP OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW AND RUN TO GOD KNOWS WHERE"
"5754","What if this was real an the fell cuz they were all sitting you got to stand -.-"
"5755","What in the actual fuck?"
"5756","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run better run outrun my gun..."
"5757","This is the best drill ever. It teaches these kids how to properly react during these situations. Yeah it's scary, but so is an actual shooting. I'm glad these kids are learning how to save themselves."
"5758","It's sad we have to take such precautions in the first place I remember in fifth grade we were in lock down and it wasn't a drill but whatever was going on wasn't in our school but in the neighborhood I think it was maybe someone who escaped a prison or maybe it was a police chase idk the teachers didn't say or maybe I don't remember but it was really scary because it was like a year or less after Sandy Hook and it was still pretty fresh in my mind"
"5759","Just go in the bathroom. No one aint lookin for a 10 year olds ding- ding.

Or masturbate."
"5760","Everyone in my class acts like their going to die when the principal(s) come in and tell us it's over XD I showed this to my friend and he was speechless XD"
"5761","In manassas park city school we had 2 hours to stay in the lockdown and I,m made it out alive"
"5762","Say.....  COLARADOOOOO"
"5763","Once we did a drill, and my classmate stood up and asked the teacher to go to the bathroom. 🤣"
"5764","At my school they actually let us use books and chairs as weapons. We barricade ourselves too."
"5765","Mhm, just put all the kids I'm a corner where it's easier for the shooters to get them."
"5766","I remember when my school was on lockdown because of when killer clowns were commonly sighted, they threatened an elementary school that was part of district I attended. Then one day they made the middle school I attend go on lockdown, because they were trying to make sure we would be ready just in case a killer clown threatened us."
"5767","My school locks the doors"
"5768","I'm so sorry that was fucked up but I had to"
"5769","and we will attack his ass"
"5770","vKhaw Same happend to me there was a note in the bathroom"
"5771","vKhaw same I was stuck in a room on my own and I am diabetic so it made it that much worse"
"5772","yeah the friends i made that day are still my best school friends now aha"
"5773","vKhaw hey atleast you made friends lol"
"5774","Maybe not Americans but that's a whole 'nother argument about that country's fascination with 'proving themselves in war'."
"5775","kateemma22 Are you suggesting that people support gun control? lmao, that's the best joke i've heard in a longgggggggg time"
"5776","(holly)"
"5777","I wish that was my teacher hit me up teach"
"5778","At my school they do this

Teacher:ok class so
(Klaxon alarm goes off)
Me:WHAT THE FRICK
Announcment:just a drill
Me oh okay


2 years later 

Klaxon alarm
Me WHAT THE 
Anouncment: just a drill so plz Hadley don't freak out like every other time
Class laughs
Me:okay everyone needs to shut up
Everyone stays quiet turns of lights locks door and hides in corner

And that's how my school does it"
"5779","Yeah, go into a school full of kids and act like its an acctualy school shooting.



they'll be FIIIIINEEEE"
"5780","Why not give the teachers guns?"
"5781","Sure, let's give these kids PTSD in a safe learning environment. Nothing can go wrong."
"5782","What do I do if my school gets hit by a Russian air strike?"
"5783","At my school, we don't have blinds. We hide right behind a table behind our door. It takes our teacher a few times to shut the door. Now our school keeps our doors open. Thanks school."
"5784","there should of been shot by the police"
"5785","They all are gonna die if they dont run out side,all hiding in a corner!?!"
"5786","She was like you can pick my ass up but I'm not letting go"
"5787","In my school lock down goes like this

The phone will randomly say Lock Down 2 times
we sit next to the door so when the person looks through it no one is there 
we turn off the blinds lights and everything (are doors won't lock sadly) if we hear someone breaking in we will run to the 
exit and hide outside in the playground because it's huge (we got a field normal playground a kindergarten playground)"
"5788","fucking americans"
"5789","Dang, not even my school is that scary. All that happens is we have a fire drill then having a lockdown, where the teacher or staff bang on the door and do fake announcements"
"5790","That's why I live in Australia"
"5791","Shooter walks into school all door closed its Wednesday and all curtain are closed well no ones here I guess I'll go to the bar"
"5792","My school barricades our doors"
"5793","I don't get why parents try to get their kids if there's a shooter. If you go and get your kid, you're gonna get shot, and if you manage to grab your kid and get back into the hallway, both of you will die."
"5794","We had an unannounced lockdown drill and then the principal was on the P/A yelling ""This is not a drill."" Just to add suspense. But even the teachers didnt know it was a drill. Well anyway, so the principal got her husband to pretend to be a shooter and gave him a key to open the doors and also a nerf gun but to pretend it is a real one. But when he came to our class people couldnt see and thought it was a real gun and we were throwing stuff at him and then we broke his arm and 2 of his ribs. But none of us felt bad. Because that is a really fucked up thing to do."
"5795","I honestly think this was a good idea. They now know how to react and what to do"
"5796","i would hide in the corcer and punch him in the throat"
"5797","Wow! How could the Teacher survive the attack???"
"5798","I think that instead of just pulling down a grey shade over the window of the door, they should put a photo of a photo of an empty classroom."
"5799","sandy hook was a hoax!"
"5800","One of my teachers has a gun under her desk and its for school shooters P.S. its totally allowed at my school for teachers to carry guns"
"5801","*throws balls*

me: OH CAUSE THAT'S GONNA STOP A GUY WI TH A GUN"
"5802","once in when i was in fifth grade there was a bomb threat and we had to walk like 10 minutes away to this golfing place. it was in the winter and we had to sit outside in the freezing cold for 2 hours. we got to leave early tho. #worthit"
"5803","No to scare everybody but locking the door isn't going to do shit all u have to do is shoot the lock"
"5804","Luckily at where i live we dont even come across the thought of a school shooting"
"5805","that happen at my school with a guy had a real gun. i got shot it did not hert"
"5806","They usually lock the doors in a LOCKdown. Also, some teachers actually separate the students around the classroom. Lastly, I feel like they should teach self defense in school, not as an extracurricular activity because it's actually a life skill we need to learn."
"5807","resting but not fighting back so what happens when he punches you in the face"
"5808","There is a shooter in the school!everyone huddle behind my desk so you can't all be killed in 3 bullets"
"5809","""We are gonna ask you to do it again, but this time he's gonna fight back a little bit""
Teacher; *looks surprised* ""oh..ok""

WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN A REAL LIFE SITUATION A GUN MAN ISN'T GONNA JUST STAND THERE AND LET YOU TAKE HIM DOWN!!"
"5810","The idea is nice, but i still don't see how a desk and a teacher without any true weapon is gonna take out and protect children from a loaded freak"
"5811","my school in Canada doesn't do school shooting drills even though when I was kindergarten, someone walked into our kindergarten classes with a loaded gun. didn't shot anyone, but they went to jail."
"5812","if this happens I would hide right by the door and stab him with my pencil"
"5813","My heart goes out to that girl. You could feel her desperation during that drill."
"5814","Yea but if the was  where's two shooters"
"5815","teacher: Ok kids we are gonna have a school shooting drill, everyone into the corner and-
me: *jumps onto desks screaming like a monkey and runs out of room*

I hate it when teachers say 'stay calm' when the event happening is dangerous or scary"
"5816","What the actual fuck are you trying to give these kids PTSD??? If you are going to perform this insane drill, at least give them a warning????"
"5817","At my school there's just a alarm out of the loud speaker and we go under our desks... Geese this is intense"
"5818","This was kinda cringe"
"5819","They had one of these at my school and I almost ran out of the exit"
"5820","hey you know mrs.blackman"
"5821","My school once had an unannounced lockdown drill. The worst part was it was only around a week after the clown threats, and our teacher didn't know about the drill either, so me and my best friend were huddled in the corner, scared as fuck, and on the verge of tears because we didn't want to die. I even snuck my phone out of my backpack (no phones are allowed out)  in case something ACTUALLY went wrong. This is a true story."
"5822","Take them down like that? Here's a way to take them in less than a second. 1. Grab your .44 (or .357, your choice) that everyone over 18 should have. 2. As soon as you see the gunman, blast his/her head off. Problem solved."
"5823","fucking barracade the doors god we did that in my middle school and now in our highs cool to"
"5824","When My School Was On Lockdown, We Hade To Stay Afterschool Ended For 30 Minutes And I Sat The Closest To The Door I was Like, ""I'm Ready TO Get My Heaviest Book And Was Ready Throw It And Start Kicking"
"5825","I would grab a table for defense and scicorrs for attack and kick the crap out of him"
"5826","*every American parents worst fear"
"5827","you will scar them for life. also, don't go to school if your child told you there is a schools shooter. then, the shooter can sneak in with the parents or shoot the parents. also some bombs activate with things like phones, computers, etc. so sending a text or email can kill everyone."
"5828","Of course in Florida OF COURSE! WHY DO I LIVE HERE?"
"5829","Yesterday there was a drill at my school and my class was In the middle of PE when we heard a beeping noise so the class (and the teacher) was trying to figure out if it was lock down or the beep test😂 then we heard the principal tell    Us over the loud speaker ""THIS IS A LOCK DOWN"" but he DIDDNT tell us it was a drill so I was freaking out😭😂 so the class had to run from the oval to the gym in one big group🤔 THE END"
"5830","lol what if everybody had guns in and it was neccesary to carry one think of that lol thatd be fucked up but cool and postive and negative in some ways"
"5831","that was hilarious when they threw balls at the fake shooter when he came in"
"5832","My school is in the middle of a city and is right next to a fire station. Once the alarm went off and it was real and everyone was like SHIT and ran to the oval. The fire station heard the alarm and ran to the school and the dumbest teacher at school LEFT THE STOVE IN THE STAFF ROOM ON AND SMOKE TRIGGERED THE ALARM. The firefighters were legit like you fucking retard"
"5833","I would at least try to fight"
"5834","How the fuck you going to be scared when it's obviously fake?"
"5835","if someone broke into my classroom, i would get everyone to throw chairs at him and say ""SIT DOWN KID"""
"5836","Dude, if a dude stuck his hand through the door trying to get into my classroom, I can guarantee that that arm will not come out the same when he takes it out of the window. Lol! I am trained I combat, can disarm a weapon, and know how to block a door and get out of a building without being killed. Do not try to attack the pixie girl that weighs 65 pounds. It will end very badly. Lol! What's scary though is that I live in Colorado. SCARY!"
"5837","dont post the fucking strategy wtf what if a shooter watches this like wtf🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓"
"5838","They actually have school shooting drills in America! I feel bad for the kids there."
"5839","I think it's a good way to get kids scared so they'll take the drills seriously. When I was in school, lockdown drills were fun and we enjoyed them, and that shouldn't be the case."
"5840","this is stupid, hiding in a corner with the lights off? im pretty sure a school shooter would know that kids go to school during the week early in the day, theyre not gonna say ""oh i guess nobodys here, well im leaving"" if this was real id hide somewhere else rather than get shot with everyone"
"5841","they should be happy because the officers are learning the layout of the school. train as you would proform"
"5842","Britain has no guns SAFE"
"5843","We had an actual lockdown when I was in elementary and it lasted about 5 hours, almost as long as the actual school day. We were lucky to have a kitchen in the classroom but there was no food in the fridge. There was a large area in the back of the classroom out of view of the door and windows. It was about 10 feet by 10 feet in perimeter and there were toys and drawing stuff back there as well. Our grade 2 teacher had a block of cheese in the cupboard and a student took a plastic knife from his lunch bag. After about an hour we were able to kinda move around and play. Lunch was cheese as most of us left our lunchbags in the hall. I shared my sandwich with everyone though."
"5844","surely having them all huddled in one corner would make it easier for the shooter to kill as many as possible?"
"5845","when I was little evrytime there was a fire drill I would cry......and onetime I was so scared I started screaming.....😂"
"5846","I never get scared when we have the School shooting drill
And I've Gotten in trouble For Jumping out the window But I know Judo and Tai-Kwan do 
SoOOooooOOOoooOOoo"
"5847","At my high school omce we had a 2 hour lockdown and then when it was over they said 'Someone called and said they had planted bombs in the classrooms' Like wtf so you make us stay in where the bombs could possibly be?"
"5848","Its all good until the student shooter knows the plan 😂😂😂"
"5849","I'm so scared to go to school every day because of shooters and stuff it's always in the back of my head"
"5850","The problem with 3:49 is typically school shooters, are students. Alot of them know the drills and how to prepare for them, but none the less should this sorta thing be practiced everywhere."
"5851","Why does everyone hide under the desks??? 
I mean, he or she can still point the gun underneath the table and shoot."
"5852",".. lock the door close the windows and hide under your desk"
"5853","the shooter is just cleaning the rooms"
"5854","ive had a drill for5 hours"
"5855","Wow this is so wrong!!!!
Kids with probably ptsd after this thanks law enforcement
Dumb fucks"
"5856","We had 2 lock downs because bees swarmed 🐝🐝"
"5857","i like the idea"
"5858","And drill in schools are ridiculous because if it was a real situation obviously the kids wouldn't be that calm, they'd flip the fuck out and draw attention."
"5859","what if the teachers are the shooters then they know everything"
"5860","3:50 best way to take out a school shooter. 

shooter walks in: TENIS BALLS"
"5861","We had one of these at my schools and was absolutely terrifying!"
"5862","I've had a real lockdown in my school and it was scary i thought i was gonna die"
"5863","The school shootings in sweden? None in ages. Are Guns legal? No."
"5864","School shooters would not use glocks or a p226 that would use sawed off just like Eric and Dylan and would be more ""tactical"""
"5865","My school is so unsafe from these shootings, every classroom in the school has like 3 giant windows"
"5866","We hardly have drills"
"5867","if this actually happened I wouldn't listen to the teacher I'd throw a fucking desk through the window and run like hell"
"5868","my teacher said that if someone walks in the class with a gun we all   attack him because if we just hide under are desk then he can just walk in and shoot us it's stupid to tell them to hide so they can get shot like sitting ducks"
"5869","If anything, locking yourself in a classroom is basically a fresh can of sardines for the shooter"
"5870","if we just sat in the corner with a shooter, I swear I would just be, ""we need  to break scissors in half, and tape them to yard sticks. spears bro. hide near the door, take a backup scissors, if you can , get behind him and hold the scissors to his neck, if needed,  stab. attempt to get the gun with spears and blades."
"5871","We had one of these yesterday..."
"5872","My school had a lockdown twice. One time a crazy parent was going through a divorce and wanted to see their kid but they weren't aloud to and they were going crazy running through the school and another time a kid stabbed the guidance counselor in the face and leg with a pencil and he was running through the school. Crazy shit happens"
"5873","My school does A.L.I.C.E  and I feel safer now that I know it"
"5874","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks"
"5875","That is so fucking messed up"
"5876","Throwing balls at him? Omg what a joke"
"5877","Landon McNalley IM DYING XD"

"5880","Jordan Schuster I"
"5881","HappilyRaini I was in 2nd grade while watching a movie then a bomb threat happened ._."
"5882","I had a bomb threat in middle school and we were on the field for around an hour. And on the way down to the field someone fell and broke their leg so we had to call an ambulance which then got stuck on the field, trying to get out and the teachers had to push it XD One of the most interesting school days ever"
"5883","HappilyRaini we had bomb threat and the police had to stop cars because we had to walk across roads to the school opposite us. On the other school's oval they had bull ants and we had to sit on them. Lets just say people got bitten.."
"5884","Ava Irwin in real life a shooter is just gonna sucker punch u in the face if u try to take his gun away"
"5885","Ava Irwin the guy just walks into the classroom and stands there xD"
"5886","She was probably more scared than shocked."

"5894","Boi one day in 3rd grade there was a lockdown RIGHT after we came from lunch. So we sat on our butts for about 1 hour..."
"5895","at my school we just sit under our desks playing with our phones or cards or some crap..."
"5896","Barricade the door don't hide behind a desk block the door,hiding doesn't prevent much."
"5897","The only thing we do is a fire drill where we assemble on a yard surrounded by four other blocks, one of which being the largest building in school. So, yeah, if that exploded, the whole school would be dead."
"5898","They should use nerf guns next"
"5899","I would grab there wrist and bite as hard as possible to get the gun out of the hand so I could point it at the attacker"
"5900","If a shooter comes in my school i'm running through the back fucking door as soon as one shot goes off."
"5901","In Denmark, we don't have gun-drills, we only have fire-drills."

"5904","wait wouldn't the school shooter just shoot them not just scream at them? like if I was a school shooter I'd just blast them."

"5909","ok when i grow up im sending my kid to private school or catalick school"
"5910","Hey gunman CASH ME OUTSIDE HOW BOUT DAT"
"5911","I only do fire drills i guess cuz i go to high school"
"5912","If all of the kids are bunch together, they would be so much easier to shoot."
"5913","Why not just install windows in every classroom so that the students can just flee, instead of just sitting in a dark room and wait till they get shot."
"5914","Murica!"
"5915","Columbine was good can't wait for it to happen in my school <3"
"5916","It was pretty intimidating"
"5917","I was there at Jewett"
"5918","Actual idiocy"
"5919","It would be funny if they never got a shooter"
"5920","If a shooter goes in a school on a week day and all the lights are out you think he's just gonna leave"
"5921","man i really wish my school trained my teachers to fight back i think that would really work my teacher are strong"
"5922","the takedown is shit, the shooter can shoot while supposedly being taken down, and what if that shot hit a student? then what?"
"5923","Why not give teachers bats that would work much better or shovels or guns"
"5924","$avage"
"5925","We had one and it turned out to be a dog that got into the school"
"5926","unannounced lock downs are so unproductive, at least if you don't let them know it's a drill. What are you going to do when those kids think the real thing is fake?"
"5927","My school has no1 come in"
"5928","damn white kids and white adults shooting up schools and trump calls us Mexicans bad lol makes no sence"
"5929","*this story is not real...*

One day in science we where making a potion with acid so dangerous it could burn your hand. We heard a loud bang and a scream. The headmasters voice boomed through the class....*this is not a drill, go into lockdown*
We heard a man banging on the door *NO ONE WILL SURVIVE*. He opened the door and my teacher poured the mixture on him."
"5930","Imagine if your a robbery in the school and went to the first room and then suddenly everybody charged at you."
"5931","I had a shooting drill a couple weeks ago, our teacher was like ""GET INSIDE NOW!"" We hid inside, under a table. Lucky for us the shooter was not in the school, he was in the neighborhood next to it!"
"5932","But what if he shoots the door handle then what"
"5933","Legend says if u hear the pumped up kids themes ur fucked"
"5934","5 minute long lock downs? We had a drill that was an hour!"
"5935","How too take someone down , hide behind The door , then grab there gun , and if they shoot , let IT be your arm do not let IT hit your chest  or thighs , then use your legs as your main combat limb , kick Them multiple times ,try too trip Them if there bigger than you , if there like too big jump on there back and then grab there Head and make your self fall"
"5936","Instead of teaching teachers CQC, why don't we let the ones with concealed carry licenses carry? Its easier to win a gun fight if you already have a gun?"
"5937","same thing happen to me"
"5938","its every parents worst nightmare
and every students favorite dream"
"5939","my teacher said that if a school shooter came to the class room everyone attack. if you attack only a few people will get shot but if you sit in the corner you all die."
"5940","at my school its JUST lights off"
"5941","Almost got a ticket for going 130? He would have gone to jail..."
"5942","If the shooter walks into the school to see every door closed and locked, possibly with blinds over the windows, shouldn't the schools know by now that the shooter probably knows you're in there? I get that theres nothing you can really do about it, but really. By now, every shooter knows that theres gotta be people in there. :/"
"5943","if it was real they would all be bitchen"
"5944","Lockdown drills are DUMB AS HELL. ""Like hey, let's sit in the corner with the lights off and the shooter won't suspect a thing! And when the shooter barges in the room, we'll all be safe in the corner!"" If one day there was a real lockdown at my school, we would all be fucked."
"5945","sandy hook was fake"
"5946","I live in the *UK* and we have what is called a ""stranger danger"" alarm.

Literally all the teachers are told to do is lock the door. We're not even told to climb under our desks. We're supposed to just sit there quietly with the door locked."
"5947","Lmao any practice drills my school does would  get us all killed haha, ""okay kiddos, walk outside while the building catches on fire"""
"5948","US is truly the most fucked up country on earth."
"5949","Lol, the kids giggled at 2:40 lmao"

"5955","A shooter came into our school, and we had a sub. She ran us outside, and we ran to a girls house and called our parents. 3 of my friends died."
"5956","My school we barricade the door with all the desks and the principle tries to get in with a bat equipped and if he does we through all of our I pads at him"
"5957","she wouldve likely at least caused his handgun to malfunction.   thats better than nothing."
"5958","Or when there is a real one, and the shooter comes in, and the teacher is fat. All the teacher has to do is sit on the shooter lol."
"5959","I remember when I had a lockdown in elementary, there was a guy that went in the school without permission. Turns out he was a campus kid that forgot where his school was 😂"
"5960","now kids are going to think it's fake when there's an actual legit lockdown. cuz you know kids aren't retarded.."
"5961","The interview with the teacher seems like she was crying"
"5962","at my school we just go to a corner 😂😂😂😂"
"5963","Of course this is in Florida"
"5964","I think that it is great for teachers getting that kind of education and how to deal with that kind of a situation"
"5965",""" Terrifying realistic drill. and that's an issue,"" so is sitting in the corner, with a wooden door between you and a maniac with a gun. If there was a real shooting, I would climb through the vents. I'm tiny"
"5966","1:25 How did her husband almost get a ticket if all the officers were at the school????"
"5967","just ban all white people from attending school"
"5968","Why is this in my recommended?"
"5969","Also when we had a fake lockdown my social studies teacher didn't do the drill she was like let's just continue with the lesson. I was like what kind oh a teacher does that I love what these teaches are doing"
"5970","This is a great idea"
"5971","Hellø frøm the twenty øne piløts natiøn"
"5972","In England we luckily do not have any of this"
"5973","if there was a lockdown, i would just hide in the very, very cornerest corner you could get into and when they shot, play dead"
"5974","At my school we spread out into 4 groups around the classroom or around the room walls and we're supposed to throw books, desks and other things at the shooter to try to take him down."
"5975","at my school when there is a lock down they are taken as a joke everyone is on their phone or talking and laughing"
"5976","Turn this into the happy side, he looks like darth Vader"
"5977","*play Pumped up Kicks to make it seem even more realistic*"
"5978","We never have theese I'm from England"
"5979","Omg!Just hire security you dumb fucks!!!"
"5980","Ther Was a guy with I gun up the street  we that he was in our school so that happen"
"5981","grande means grenade"
"5982","my school drill sucks they like. kids get down and am like what if they have a Grande"
"5983","Duck and cover is so much cooler"
"5984","Fake blood and fake dead people? Are you serious? thats going to far."
"5985","who else typed pumped up kicks"
"5986","at 6:10 i think the strategy at that very moment would be to like hop backwards flipping the attacker over"
"5987","I think about why I never have shooting drills in my school. Then I remember, I'm Canadian. If there is a shooting, they either got the gun from the black market,  or America, seeing as we banned guns. Thanks , guys."
"5988","We did one of these in school it's terrifying they didn't use the guns tho 😥"
"5989","Some teachers need to be able to have guns or have a school gun cabinet in the staff room in case of a shooting"
"5990","Last time I was in a lockdown drill a kid was laying on top of me"
"5991","maybe we should give teachers riot shields and a revolver"
"5992","This is so stupid when theres a mass shooter you don't just sit there and let them shoot you WHEN THATS THEIR AIM, those kids would all of been killed if they listened to their teacher they should of ran and would of had a fighting chance"
"5993","shorty dagreat whites have problems"
"5994","Dazzling Donut fucking retard"
"5995","Dazzling Donut did he kill the teacher?"
"5996","I probably meant I wont survive"
"5997","Dazzling Donut I guess neither did he himself. 😂"
"5998","waga95 most likely"
"5999","D-Gall 4 sf"
"6000","D-Gall 4 bro ur lucky we are supposed sit their and do the shooters demands like bro"
"6001","D-Gall 4 - Good idea!! My teacher lets us throw whatever we want, I'm in middle school, someone in my class brings a knife every day... I get kinda scared."
"6002","At least you have a backup plan!"
"6003","D-Gall 4 If you're luck to find one... Get acid"
"6004","Modes_ I agree it's like being evacuated to a bomb shelter."
"6005","Antonia xx the fire drills over here look more tense than the shooter drills in America though... I mean, they don't tell us it's a drill..."
"6006","Antonia xx the fire drills over here look more tense than the shooter drills in America though... I mean, they don't tell us it's a drill..."
"6007","well u should be warned just in case"
"6008","what?"
"6009","scrumps1987 me"
"6010","scrumps1987 me lmao"
"6011","So they don't lock their doors.......?"
"6012","Kids normally have scissors in their pencil cases that helps"
"6013","in a lockdown you'r not allowed to use your phone's so the parents coming to the school was the children's fault not the school."
"6014","I go to a catholic school so.... I will probably be fine"
"6015","Our school we had a lockdown cause there were a guy playing with his dog😂"
"6016","America.  
Paying millions for lockdown training 
Paying millions to buy guns 
👏"
"6017","my school had a lock down but there was no gun and no one got hurt but i think it is important to practice got things like this"
"6018","So they're basically asking teachers and kids to risk their lives to take down the gunman! How about building a safe bunker in classrooms where the gunman would physically be unable to get to them?"
"6019","You mean teacher fight club"
"6020","5:18-5:21 freeeestyyylee"
"6021","Turning off the fucking lights and covering the window on the door doesn't do anything lmao"
"6022","1.Sandy Hook was fake and the news knows that

2.Keep doing those drills who gonn take it serious when something goes down smh"
"6023","everyone is a sitting duck the drills are pointless and a waste of time"
"6024","Hopefully the SWAT taught them about hostage rescue if they didn't now that is a big problem"
"6025","Shooters are not simple mined they will search the room for any possible hostage not just DOOR IS LOCK NO ONE HERE NEXT DOOR no they will break the Windows probably instead of AHH WINDOWS THAT ARE COVERED I GUESS NO ONE IS HERE fucking dumb schools"
"6026","2:38 why is he smiling what if it wasn't a drill"
"6027","What the fuck that door needs a device that can hold it down unless someone uses a bomb on it and they do make these things that keep doors shut unless you blow the door down plus all of you in one spot is easier for all of you to DIE"
"6028","Man the drills in schools these days suck they should train kids what part of your body you should cover and what to do in EVERY possible situation that could happen in a shooting and hand to hand combat EDIT1 just watched the whole vid they did teach hand to hand combat but they need to teach more like how go bring them down because they will punch you to try and overcome you to shoot you"
"6029","I'm pretty sure saying ""WE ARE IN LOCKDOWN"" on the speakers will alert the shooter. Lol pathetic"
"6030","I go to a Colorado school and there was a real lockdown once, a kid had a gun"
"6031","What if the shooter came during the drill....."
"6032","everyone guesses that the ""shooter"" is a guy, what uf it is a girl😂😂😂"
"6033","We're learned to jump out the window if possible. No fucks given 😂"
"6034","im kinda scared to go to school now"
"6035","I like how just one of the boys starts hugging the girl"
"6036","At our school we lock the door, ads an extra lock, block it with desks, and don't always hide. It's announced over the announcements where the intruder is, and if they're on the other side of the building we leave. If they are close we hide, and if they get through we throw stuff at them."
"6037","They don't do this at my school......... they do lock downs and fire stuff. but I would love having one like this."
"6038","we had a school lockdown, we had these huge reading books and we'd throw our books at em'"
"6039","Here in England we don't have shooting drills. Wanna know why? Cos nobody has guns here so it's pointless :O! 
America allows the most stupid shit to go on, just ban guns lol."
"6040","thats why we need for men teachers."
"6041","My school is SMACK right in front of a military base in point loma. so.. its kinda hard for 1 shooter to face hundreds of military men...





yikes"
"6042","Screw hiding. Run out of the building FIRST! Only hide if you can't get out safely"
"6043","That was funny when they threw a lot of tennis balls"
"6044","0:49 don't you see that kid waved at the camera 😂"
"6045","If a school shooting happens I would be cover in blood or red paint and play dead. Actually Worked for Halloween Prank"
"6046","we had a drill cause of clowns running around some kids started crying and some was hiding under the desk while the teacher was at the desk grading papers like wth"
"6047","i would run to the nearest window and jump and run"
"6048","when. abc doesn't have a good video is so stupid they scare children"
"6049","To be honest, I wish my school did this. Now yeah, it would be pretty scary, but it would be a lot better to have these drills then to have a real shooter come in and me not know what to do. Some parents don't think about these things, and need to think more about their childs safety than the childs emotions. Plus, it would help us with life skills later in life and in combat."
"6050","Lol my teacher taped shears to the end of a cane and almost stabbed the guy that came in"
"6051","IT'S JUST A DRILL BRO"
"6052","One time me and my friend were in a lockdown and the guy got in he had a gun there was a gap between us he shot the gun at me it went through the gap part of the football team was in my class they were brave they ran jumped and tackled him he started shooting it only hit are window people were crying after the bullet went between my friend and I we both played dead so he did not try to shoot us any more"
"6053","The problem is that they never let us know if a drill of any sort is the real thing or not. This causes us to not take these things seriously and in a real situation, our lives would be in danger because we have no clue if it is real or not. I feel this is something that needs to be fixed in schools everywhere."
"6054","same that happen to me"
"6055","I remember during a code black I had to go to the bathroom and I was walking then the principal came over the speakers and said ""We are having a lockdown I repeat a lockdown."" And I was like ""oh it's just a drill"" :-3 so I kept walking until I saw a officer..and I was like.. OH SHOOT I sprinted to the bathroom and locked the stall bathroom.. then the officer came into the girl's bathroom. And he knocked on the stall and he said OPEN UP and I said nothing and just put up my feet.. BUT I WAS GOING NUMBER TWO,so he slid banged on the door and i out my feet down so then I opened the door and the officer was like ""KID WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME YOU NEEDED THE BATHROOM?!"" (It was a drill) and I said ""I  well I needed to go"" the end. Also he was a officer and spoke with my principal.. but .. all good"
"6056","that one kid at the colorado school shadowed at my scchol today lol"
"6057","If their was a school shooting my class would be the first one to go"
"6058","At my school if we have a shooter the girls throw stuff at the shooter and the guys try to tackle or jump on the attacker. And the teacher does the same things"
"6059","I WOULD AT LEAST TELL THEM"
"6060","lol u guys better take this advice when i come to ur school"
"6061","These drills shouldn't exist because there should be no guns."
"6062","According to wiki there have been 1 school shooting in the U.K. and there's has been over 350 in the US which for some reason makes me think that guns should probably be illegal. I dunno I was just thinking 💭."
"6063","he's a novel idea america TIGHTEN UP YOUR GUN LAWS so people dont die"
"6064","i would be so fucking scarced"
"6065","I once had a drill for like an hour. lol"
"6066","we dont do this in the uk ... probs cuz you cant get a gun"
"6067","bruh they did this at my school and this random kid punched another kid in the face"
"6068","At my school when we have lockdown and people talk and be loud I punch them in the face I get in trouble but it's worth it they shut up. Btw this is not my account it's my sister. And I will not punch a girl."
"6069","it's just a drill bro!"
"6070","Look this is good and all if there is only 1 shooter what if there's like 4 with assault rifles"
"6071","I know if there was a school shooter I would not stay like a sitting duck. My parents always told me, if possible, get a fire extinguisher. You spray them in the eyes then crack them with the empty canister."
"6072","what is stopping kids from throwing desks. ""Bitch you just got hit with where my ass goes"
"6073","Yo dat teacher took that man down like a beast"
"6074","if you say oh it's a lock down then no one is scared well that's dumb not saying don't give them the option to skip cuz they should be able to but you need to be as realistic as possible"
"6075","in our school, they tell us there will be a drill, but they dont tell us what time. we have to sit in the corner where nobody can see us from the doors or windows, and the principal comes around in checks all the classrooms. it usually takes about 20 minutes since our school is so big. (3 floors)"
"6076","At my school lockdown my grade six class  beat the fuck out of the invading shooter. We were so close to him he couldn't shoot and rekt him"
"6077","My class is instructed to throw anything we have to anyone who may enter the room during a lockdown so ;-;"
"6078","wtf is this"
"6079","*school shooting drill* real shooter comes in"
"6080","""ALMOST got a ticket he was doing 130"" lol I'm sure it's gonna be a little more than a ticket doing 130"
"6081","My teacher has us climb into the highest cabinet in our classroom or in our locker if we fit."
"6082","sure, just go ahead and give these little kids psychological trauma why dont ya?"
"6083","the only thing lm thinking of is how that teacher will hate teaching after 10 years"
"6084","My drills are shit.
We just hid under cabinets and turned the lights off and locked the door. WE ARE FUCKED IF A SHOOTER OPENS THE DOOR!"
"6085","my drills are about an hour"
"6086","Yeah I wish all drills was like that, I've done that in a Florida ACCELERATED Middle School and it's not like that because they let you know it's a drill and we have stupid kids in our class with some stupid teachers. Nobody likes it nobody cares so I bet this news story was over exaggerated. The school drills are shit like our school system in Florida."
"6087","I live like 30 minutes from SkyView academy"
"6088","I do this in school and it's never like this"
"6089","Are shooters really that stupid though? Like oh hey, the class has the light off with some apparent poster paper over the room view windows, im sure no one is inside! Oh let me take a look... The desks are scattered! No im sure no ones here!"
"6090","Someone farted during a drill they could have killed us if it was real because you would just hear a bunch of kids laughing"
"6091","In a school shooting drill everyone whispers to eachother.. Once people were whispering and my teacher almost yelled at the kids. Once I whispered to my friend ""Can I jump out the window"" and she said ""HECK NO"" XD"
"6092","He had a parent that came in with a gun and we went under lockdown for the whole class period"
"6093","My school had a real lockdown this year as well as all of the other schools in the area, this phsyco escaped prison and robbed a bank then he went to the supermarket across the street and held someone at gunpoint. We had to hide in the cabinets and in the corner and everyone was freaking out."
"6094","I remember a school doing this  my sister did not know so she went into shock and then they stopped"
"6095","I did one of these is 5th grade and we all just got in a closet. 7th grade now and I haven't had one since"
"6096","we had one of these at school and my friend was just giving people pieces of his sandwich😂"
"6097","Wtf i live in montreal and go to an elementary school(6th grade) and like when we have a lockdown drill, the principal wiggles the knob lol and knocks the door 4 times like lol"
"6098","this is why I bring forks, gotta protect yourself somehow. might as well headbutt lol"
"6099","i wish my school defends like that and not just sit on the floor next to our desks"
"6100","6:13 what the teachers do on there free time"
"6101","When we had a real one my Friend and me message my Mom and she came and took him out true store"
"6102","They think taking down a ""shooter"" is now a fun competition"
"6103","we have these we call them lockdowns"
"6104","Anyone else on the edge of their seat routing for her when she fr fought back that guy in the gym? Damn I was like holding my breath hoping she'd win so bad omg"
"6105","THIS IS HOW IT GOES DOWN IN SOME SCHOOLS? In mine, a PSA came over and said there was an active shooting training drill and our teachers instructed us on what to do. Most of them told us to hide, but then there was this ONE teacher that said ""If some asshole comes in and tries to kill you, I hope one of you picks up a desk or a book and throws it. I'll do the same because none of you are dying with me around."" Also, no one came through the hallways or anything. It was just the PSA, the instructions."
"6106","Schools changed their lock down drills now.  Teachers at my school tell us to run out the door if the shooter is far away.  But if they are already too close, we should lock the door, and put chairs and tables in front of it and get ready to fight."
"6107","At my school, we barely ever get warnings when we do a lockdown drill, and we get to chuck tennis balls at the fake intruder. Also my friend always goes ""is it okay"" every like 20 seconds and it's kind of annoying, because we all know it's a drill"
"6108","we were practicing incase there was a lockdown in gym, and the security guard was acting as he bad guy.
 when we hid, the "" class clown "" of the class yelled at him while he was knocking on the door. he said something like 
"" don't come in, ya ugly "". he was scolded intensely"
"6109","Did this for the first time in my school and some kid gets up and throws a chair at the 'shooter' and deadass knocks him out. Now that is what these kids should be doing.."
"6110","man now I want this in my school"
"6111","Nana Marie genius right?"
"6112","Baconlover863 same"
"6113","Orange is the new black so your ready if it actually happens"
"6114","Why would you want to prepare for a shooting!?"
"6115","Baconlover863 same (for some odd reason...)"
"6116","AAAA MY MOST LIKES"
"6117","Logan P Logan it was scary"
"6118","Jackson Thomas Jackson I temper that"
"6119","yes becuase putting accelerated in all caps does not make you look like an asshole"
"6120","Sync Extras ikr!"
"6121","How about arming the teachers."
"6122","We only do fire drills.. our school is fucked"
"6123","3:50 Shooter walks in armed, throw fucking tennis balls at him!!"
"6124","I CANT BELEIVE THEY DO THESE  DRILLSTHAT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA"
"6125","We have drills but not this fucking extra wtf"
"6126","Where I go to school they teach us Alice training because if you just sit there and be quiet you're more likely to get injured or shot because you're just sitting there still but if you move and fight back then you are more likely to get out of the situation if you want to learn more look it up because it would really help with these situations"
"6127","Mine isn't like this we just turn off the lights and lock the door. And hide we don't have a crazy bitch run around"
"6128","my school has drills but not like this WTF"
"6129","I live in England so it's not easy to get a hold of a gun or any weapon but I think we should have this just in case
And I heard that after this term there's gonna be some sort of lockdown in classrooms for something other than a fire which is kinda scary coz I've never experienced one of these
And in this situation I would fight back if necessary!
I might actually accidentally kiss my crush before dying tho so lol!
I would fight em tbh
Adios"
"6130","school shootings are terryfiying. .. People are sick"
"6131","no this is all wrong you don't fight a school shooter unless you know how to fight did you not just see that cop fall on all of them like they all would have been dead and easily she tried to take the gun away all he has to do is get his right hand and beat her ass when she's done knocked out good night"
"6132","no this is not practicing Safety sitting behind a teacher's desk that is practicing your execution that is exactly what it is doing cuz that motherfucker is not going to just stop and be like a oh its locked better go to the next door no he is going through the door and killing all of y'all."
"6133","I've only had a lockdown drill in my life. One of them. I don't feel prepared. My brothers needed to have one. It wasn't a threat. It was hunting season and two guys with guns walked next to the playground. I have only gone over it once, and it wasn't even in that school. People aren't prepared enough for these situations."
"6134","That shit only happens in America where owning a gun is as easy as getting McDonalds"
"6135","1 school shooting per month? Good job america"
"6136","If you get him on the floor just bite the fucker and make him bleed"
"6137","I'm in scotland none of our schools even have shootings but yet again we don't have guns and our doors lock automatically"
"6138","i cant believe they have to practice this in the us 😂. They cant even control who has guns. If having a gun drill is needed there is obviously a problem in their country. To the people who say that we are defeneless. We are'nt. The reason why we dont need them is because if nobody can have them nobody will need them. Australia used to have shootings every once in a while. They tightened the gun laws and there was never a shooting again. Plus nobody needed them like they did before."
"6139","""lock down!!!"" or ""this is a drill, we need to lock down..""  
you need to make it real to train them. you can't just keep it calm. the students and staff won't react the same to a drill and the real thing. I don't understand all these adults not wanting realistic training. it needs to be realistic and terrifying to get a point across"
"6140","in my schooltimes our classrooms had atleast 2 doors to another class. and my friend always had a butterfly knife in the bottom of his bag"
"6141","Ofc it's a white school"
"6142","Yeah but what happens if it isn't a drill but the kids think it is"
"6143","I think this is cool"
"6144","these drills are useles compared to a teacher whit a gun"
"6145","our lock downs are different in are class we have a little area where we hang up our book bags we close the blinds lock the door and hide in the book bags"
"6146","the drills are stupid my class has windows and so why dont we go out of them"
"6147","But no locked doors? This school has no closets ? 😬"
"6148",".... Yet guns are still allowed in America"
"6149","This is so smart and could come in handy after school too"
"6150","Lmao fuck that shit hiding in the corner making it easy for him to shoot, boiiii I'd be out of there before that nigga even senses my fucking existence"
"6151","My school only have Fire Drills xD"
"6152","1:26 skrrt Skrrt"
"6153","Make it hard to get guns like wtf is Walmart thinking selling guns in the states"
"6154","Or just get rid of gun free zones smh..."
"6155","I thought the title was ""What it's like inside a  school of Dr. Phils"""
"6156","I live right by Columbine and I'm going there for highschool"
"6157","if a school shooting actually happened I would ignore all the ""get into the corner"" and get into a closet or wait till someone gets shot (hopefully not me) and rub their blood or red paint on my chest."
"6158","The drills we have are actually good we hide under this big desk and the teacher stacks tables against the door and if we make a peep or talk the teacher writes us up she's mean but it's for our safety so I don't complain"
"6159","Been in elementry middle high and college in colorado, never seen this type of drill. Kinda wish they did but then again I always look forward to a drill that interupts class"
"6160","We go into lockdown, it happened to my school"
"6161","Atleast fucking tell the parents before the drill and tell the kids that there well be a day this week that we'll be a drill..."
"6162","next school shooter watches this video finds where kids are hiding"
"6163","We're told to throw scissors or anything"
"6164","How to prevent shooting at schools? it should be: How to prevent bully, so shootings don't happend, so there is not social exclusion, and there is not drama and suffering. That's why the system it's broken, and the one that suffers the most it's the innocent, and the shooter."
"6165","my teacher once stood with a chair at the door lmfao"
"6166","Are they stupid??? They shouldn't be releasing these stuff to the public. Nice job now you made it so that a potential-school shooter knows how a lockdown would work!"
"6167","if u know its fake why are u scared u pussy"
"6168","its better to be scared then to be dead and wish u had"
"6169","Let's not tell them to get a better fucking drill. I see kids chuckling and laughing."
"6170","3:48 Woah That was unexpected!!!"
"6171","Omg I live in Colorado"
"6172","Oh America"
"6173","All of my classes have a lot of cabinets that are huge. Anytime we have a lock down I hop in one of those and my teachers do a head count and never know where I go when I'm in it."
"6174","I hate kids at my school they honestly make me so mad, once we had a real *School LockDown* and this guy destroyed the school and the office ladies go hurt, they where laughing -_-  they even do that in a practice"
"6175","we dont do this in our school but i think i could take someone with a gun if it came to it, i done tai kwon doe for 2 years and boxing for 3"
"6176","these may be good to learn from but what if a shooter watches this then they know what's coming. but I'll ride away on my hoverboard eating a cake pop."
"6177","Luckily, my district's instruction for lockdowns have changed, and we're allowed to take any precaution if we must. If it means running away from the school, approaching the shooter(s) violently, or barricading doors with tables and everything, we do it. I don't get the lights out bs."
"6178","0:42 lmao there is a girl just out with her phone like nothing's happening"
"6179","One time we had a shooting drill during orchestra and my teacher didn't care so we just kept practicing and the  principal walked in and the teacher and the principal just stared at each other for 10 seconds straight really awkwardly. ""So this is your procedure for shooting huh?"", ""Yep."""
"6180","Honestly the school shouldn't've apologized. The shock and surprise prepared kids better than if they were told it wasn't real. Plus, knowing middle schoolers they would not have taken it seriously if they knew it wasn't real"
"6181","I can picture it now every 2 people get a table then as soon as the gunman comes in 10 desks flying across the fucking room lmao XD"
"6182","walk in the hall if there is a fire"
"6183","we had a drill and we had to hide in the cafeteria..."
"6184","bruh if someone tries to come in a room while there is a school shooting in jumping out the window and running home fud thats"
"6185","I WISH OUR DRILLS PREPARED US, WE JUST SIT IN A dark closet, no one will shut the hell up and we need to scare the crap out of middle schoolers"
"6186","man if a shooter ever comes in my school you best believe I ain't hiding behind no desks. I'm getting the hell out of there, finding a makeshift weapon and running."
"6187","I used to go to a school where it was near impossible, we were on a military base with fencing around it with electric barbed wire, multiple cameras, and guards"
"6188","The lockdowns are really bad for our school. I have a kid with a disability in my class and the lockdown announcement came on and he started screaming and wouldn't stop. We didn't have the lockdown planned someone just came in without permission."
"6189","I once had a drill which lasted 15-20 minutes and they told us it was over by opening the door unannounced"
"6190","A similar thing happened to me. I was with brownies and we did a fire drill including Party smoke and fire alarms. I now have a traumatic fear of fire and party smoke."
"6191","We don't have these in the UK. I wonder why..."
"6192","i live in the uk so its kinda shitty 4 this"
"6193","but if there training all students and students are doing the shootings so they know what's going to happen so they still know how to do the school shootings"
"6194","all teachers should at least carry a metal bat in their room."
"6195","Fuck that shit i'd legit just jump out the window and run away"
"6196","What I would do I usually keep a rope and bat in my bag. So that when a lockdown happens,I go by the door with the bar and the rope by my feet,so that when the person comes to attack might break the door down. So I will knock out the person and tie the hands and legs together until 911 or 999 arrive"
"6197","Anyone can take down a much taller and heavier individual with the right leveraging. Aikido, jujitsu and Krav Maga are excellent for this."
"6198","Im not saying this will safe everything but why don't they lock the doors first? The locks in my school are build in a way so that they're only to be opened from the inside. In an emergency the teachers locks the doors so that the shooter would have to shoot the lock before entering."
"6199","They should not have this on YouTube a shooter could watch this and have a idea where students hide"
"6200","what the heck all that happens on school is we hide under the desks, pull the blinds and lock the doors then after awhile the headteacher comes and tells us it's all over. and it's not scary, we all actually quite enjoy 5 minutes off. and sometimes we do work under the desks to catch up! we always get advance notice though."
"6201","How about just not making guns so acessible?? I don't understand you Americans.
I think the throwing things would work better from the distance though. I swear kids can throw hard."
"6202","Why would someone want to attack a school?"
"6203","at 2:10 that kid was hard 😂😂😂"
"6204","Wow, all I can say right now is wow"
"6205","My school lets us know drill or not and I am glad."
"6206","we dont have shooter drills but at my school they tell us to hide under our desks but if ur close to the door go to the back of the room"
"6207","I remember these drills when a intruder gets into the school but never had a shooting drill. Yea my ass ain't hiding in the dark. Forget that. I'm running. I'm going to run faster that the Olympic record..."
"6208","at my school we lock the doors,have emergency rope so that if they are able to unlock the door the teacher pulls on the rope to hold the door closed, while the students run for any sharp object for self defense (if we all group up and they get in it just make it easier for someone to get hurt) and the teachers are taught to break arms 👌"
"6209","omg thats just WRONG they (as in kids) should get something like money for being brave"
"6210","Wtf my lockdowns are like 15 mins and they are lit not scary at all plus how these kids got there phones in class in 7th grade"
"6211","How the fuck you gonna say thous kids to just sit down and relax when somebody is coming to kill them? I rather brake a bone jumping down from the window than get a shot"
"6212","today we just did a code red and it wasn't announced either and people started banging on our doors and yelling"
"6213","What was the name of the school that had the shooting"
"6214","My school went on lockdown the other day cause one of the kids from the middle school across us called 911 and falsley said there was a shooter."
"6215","thank goodness a have a cop in my school"
"6216","At my school all classroom doors and school doors except the main entrance doors are required to be locked at all times. If a shooter was to enter the school, they would announce lock down over the intercom if they had time, and then we would close all blinds and turn off all lights and move away from the windows on the door and the windows in general. Yep, totally prepared."
"6217","Why dose this shit only happen in America? 🙄"
"6218","i legit dont know what a shooting drill is"
"6219","What kinda school would leave the doors unlocked during a terrifyingly real drill"
"6220","If I was even in a drill, my school would be a pool."
"6221","Gage Mullis Oh yes I'm sure that the navy will dispatch a dreadnaught or two to help with your school shooter situation."
"6222","Jake McKeown well you don't have anti-Trump protesters attacking every white person who comes down the street in Australia now do you?it's not our fault that we have people looking for any excuse to be racist,And besides,if our nation's navy is far larger than the next 8 on the biggest navies list combined than I'm prettt sure we can take on a few assholes who hate the president,and besides,if somebody invades,the invaders won't only have to worry about the military but pissed of civilians as well!"
"6223","Jake McKeown its because there are millions of guns illegally in our country, hope that clears everything up"
"6224","Memes & Phandoms tell them to stfu or they'd gon to die"

"6241","one thing I hope is high schools let few kids carry hidden and they have to pass a test"
"6242","wow now say something liberals"
"6243","What the hell is this? At my school the principal just goes  ""Lockdown drill"" over the loudspeaker. And then everyone just sits in a corner for five minutes and nothing happens. This is just cruel."
"6244","Our lock down is just a locked door the window cover and back to work"
"6245","If schools are actually having to prepare children for school shootings how are people still allowed guns. if this is such a massive problem then surely letting anybody whose anybody have a gun shouldn't be okay.
why not instead of making kids have drills about getting shot at, they just stop guns. honestly it's sickening."
"6246","in my school if we get a chance to run out the building in a REAL situation we take that chance and just like thw video if a shooter cones in our classroom we atack the shooter. and my teacher has a baseball bat that he holds when we have a lockdown but one time for me it went on for like fifteen minutes"
"6247","holly carpenter is hot HOT"
"6248","wtf you cant scare kids for life like that it gives them all traumas what the fuck okay fire drills is one thing but this? jeesus christ"
"6249","This is actually stupid.. America.. Trump. You need go WAKE THE FUCK up. If the rest of the western world can enforce gun laws.
 So can you. And if youre going to answer, dont bother using ""OH ITS A GOOD WEAPON OF SELF DEFENSE"" Take the guns from people who dont have a gun license (something i made up that should be enforced) and let people go on a strict course on how to use the gun. SIMPLE."

"6255","At my jr high and high school almost every student carried a knife. I'd like to see a gunman survive getting jumped by 23 students with knives. Have to ambush the shooter, can't just sit in a corner waiting to see if he comes into your classroom."

"6262","When they were training / learning to deal with shooters. Couldn't you just puncher in the face 😂👍"
"6263","When we had a drill we had to stay after for an hour a kid got so bored he played on his DSI"

"6271","stupidity.  throwing kids in a corner with hushed voices and a locked door.  shooter isn't stupid he'll blow the door down.  need to install metal door locks bullet proof glass or a metal plate that locks over the door"
"6272","I lived in Chicago and I am a  freshman in high school in meddle school I would rather have a  sharpen pencil then have nothing but my hands holding my legs and ducking behind the teacher desk"

"6278","My school has lockdowns, fire drills, lock ins, tornado and earthquake drills, and deadly gas inside building drill.  For the last one, we have to walk 3 blocks away from school."
"6279","One time in kindergarten, we had a drill for a school shooting, and the teachers put us out in the hall against the wall and had us sit on our knees facing the wall.  Then we put our hands on our heads and our heads in our laps.  How is that supposed to help?"
"6280","My School only does fire drills and lock down terrorist drills."
"6281","you think in real life you can do it.         😗☕"
"6282","0:00 - 0:03 simple you don't"
"6283","I never understood this technique of hiding from the shooter.Clumping together?"
"6284","Im from UK if your outside where do you go"
"6285","well you banned kinder surprises which are amazingly delicous and you DON'T ban guns? and you get upset when some one gets shot, well done america good thing im canadian"
"6286","In my school we had a the first lock down learning drill ever , no one knew what to do , and my teacher thought it was a fire drill , so we walked through the whole school , to the sport field... thanks god that wasn't a real lock down"
"6287","I've actually been in a legit lockdown"
"6288","The longest lockdown drill ive been was 2 hours cus someone threatened to shoot my school"
"6289","OMG my school's in this video 😩"
"6290","People who disagree with this are part of the problem in my opinion. In a place where guns are your second amendment right it would be foolish to think that everyone who owns one can't possibly become an active shooter one day. You think the drills are scary? Try the real thing."
"6291","Good idea! You can be safe if you pull the shade down."
"6292","My Teacher Just stands at the door with scissors waiting for some nigga to come in"
"6293","one of the kids were called xaivier"
"6294","Are you not meant to lock the door?..."
"6295","Where I live you need a licence for a gun and its usually farmers who have them and the city is 1hr from the farmers so we dont have shooting lock down drills"
"6296","Lockdown drills are awful. Practically every shooter knows what happens when the drill is activated. Why do the kids just hide in the corner?? They are basically being put in a group so when the shooter shoots open the door, he can save bullets with collateral damage. In a real drill I would break a window and get the fuck outta there"
"6297","THE CRINGE..... K IM GONNA KMS RIGHT NOW BYE WORLD"
"6298","Someone threatened to shoot at my school yesterday...they brought a gun to school and Snapchat it."
"6299","sitting in a pile will make it much easier for the shooter to kill more victims. just saying"
"6300","comparing this to my classes... about every guy would (including me) would try to disarm the shooter or beat him to death etc."
"6301","These kinds of drills ate bullshit because the shooters done this before so it's super inneffective"
"6302","If this were me and the shooter came I take my scissors and start stabbing"
"6303","I've only done one drill and my teacher didn't even lock the door and continued teaching"
"6304","Most schools do have practice lockdowns, but to have people coming in with weapons and screaming at them!!?? That's too much."
"6305","Oh nah I'm hurting that shooter like I ain't dying"
"6306","I had a lock down yesterday"
"6307","Our school hasn't had a drill in a long time"
"6308","we have these in Canada but they're usually for animals like moose wolves and coyotes"
"6309","I dont think its ok to have a guy ""shooting."" Its ok if they have a lockdown like blinds, hiding etc. But scaring kids with fake guns isn't ok."
"6310","I wish my school was that exiting (˘_˘٥)"
"6311","Australia hasn't had a school shooting or any shooting since 1999 when gun laws where updated, Americans are stupid."
"6312","At my school, for drills we blockade the door with tables and chairs. Then the teachers tell us to grab anything to use as a weapon if the shooter were to try to get into the room. That means scissors, textbooks, etc. They all tell us the move around so we can't be a target. One of the things that school's get wrong is they tell us to go sit in corners or hide in our desks, but that would just make it easier to for the shooter to shoot us."
"6313","What if the guy going into the classrooms went crazy and switched it out with a real gun"
"6314","What if a real shooting comes in during the drill"
"6315","Glad we don't have to put our children through this traumatising experience in the UK xx"
"6316","I used to go to that school we would have lockout drills and tornado drills even though we were near the mountains and there has never been a big tornado here"
"6317","I've been in a real lock down before is was terrifying"
"6318","I'm sorry but if you need to have a gun drill for a school that school should not be open"
"6319","My school's teachers/girls: *clawing shooters eyes out while simultaneously pulling their hair and hitting them over the head with dictionary's and backpacks*"
"6320","We had a bomb threat at our school and we had to do this for three hours. There were literally helicopters and the SWAT team came into our school... and there wasn't even a bomb... a kid called the school as a prank -_-"
"6321","If there was a shooter in my school I will hide in the bathroom cause the shooter is a gentleman and will respect my privacy if not I will scream sexual harassment, rape and sexisme(cause he choose to search the bathroom I'm in either the girl's one or the boys )  when he try to shoot me"
"6322","These drills are stupid, why the hell would you be in the corner. I would get the hell out of the room."
"6323","I don't have to do them drills as I live in the UK🙃"
"6324","one of my old highschool teachers always kept a baseball bat in the closet of his room just incase lol"
"6325","BAN GUNS!!!"
"6326","ying chow"
"6327","When its practice in my school they say theres a lockdown
How whpuld we know if its real or not"
"6328","That doesn't make sense why would they put everyone into a corner where they can be massacred"
"6329","I'll feel badass if I took down a school shooter"
"6330","Why the fuck was this in recommended"
"6331","During a drill my friend took his phone out and put the song *Pumped up Kicks* in full volume , he got suspended."
"6332","3:50 everyone's throwing balls at the shooter"
"6333","If i actually had a lock down I would get out of the building if break a window if needed I would just get out"
"6334","We do, fire, tornado, and lock down drill"
"6335","i live in the UK and we never do these drills. america needs to dort out their gun laws for gods sake"
"6336","we don't have shooting drills or monthly lockdowns we only do them once a year in the beginning (⊙＿⊙)"
"6337","Sad"
"6338","the kid that waved at the camera was my sibling"
"6339","Oh god i dreamed about a school shooting, there were like 7 shooters."
"6340","Hahahahahaha"
"6341","Really? I think it's realistic ^-^"
"6342","Food Jamaa well at least you waste 5 mins in school and don't have to do work"
"6343","Food Jamaa lol same"
"6344","the kids are idiots too. you don't text your freaking parents. if your parents arrive at the school and break in they might get shot"
"6345","it was someone around the school  that the cops were chasing"
"6346","Shane Yardumian Thats what you do for a tornado. you probably got your tornado and lockdown drills messed up"
"6347","in a cluster there would be crossfiring so the shooter wont have to pick us 1 by 1....btw I would use a chair as a weapon :D"
"6348","Jake That Boi what a legend"
"6349","That is something I would do"
"6350","Savage"
"6351","that fucking edge"
"6352","In my class we all sat in the corner like a duck while the Dean of discipline banged on all the doors and terrified the 2nd graders to the point where one took a shit on the back table"
"6353","Y'know, I go to school in Chicago and with all this gun violence going around, we have lockdown drills but the kids won't shut up. Maybe if we had something like this then they would probably take it seriously for once."
"6354","GAWD I wish my school acted like that in school drills, EVERY TIME we do a school drill, theres people doing fart noises and purposly squeaking the floors, then they would yell."
"6355","I like the idea of throwing chairs at the guy, because hiding in the room aint gonna help, because if the guy gets in your screwed. To get hit with a chair or several chairs would hurt alot. I think we should have to kind of hide, but also have something to fight back with"
"6356","......"
"6357","If my school did this shit to me id be the school shooter fuck that"
"6358","So 2 months ago, my class was in music and we were going to have a lockdown drill. We were hiding by the shelves with students' instruments and there was this ""special needs"" kid who was hiding under a chair and we were trying our best to not burst out laughing. He started to sleep under the chair and when it was over, the teacher asked him why he was under there. He said that it was the only place he could ""find"". In my mind, I'm like *""boi, it ain't no frickin' earthquake""*."
"6359","Why doesn't the teacher kick the gunman in the balls. He will drop like a sack of potatoes"
"6360","""throw a hole puncher, or a chair""
BITCH PLEASE, IM THROWING MY DESK"
"6361","Oh no, 2nd amendment la di da di da.
Where are the good guys with guns? loooool at retard americans."
"6362","My school has only one floor and huge windows.. if a shooter came in i would just jump out and gtfo"
"6363","IF this happened at my school, it would be bad because I have a younger brother and younger sister that go to the same school."
"6364","Great all hide in the corner and wait to get shot. Such a great plan!"
"6365","Were I live I have Had alot of drills in the past year.They did something like this I'll tell you my point of view. So I'm in the hall way and they call for a lock down I was no were near my class so I run in the Bathroom stall I  close the Door then close my stall door another girl was next to me and we were standing on the toilets.  We crouched so you don't see our head of feet. We heard people yelling. We heard fake gun noises and the Principal banged on the door Which caused me to almost have a heart attack. when it was over we got out and they had fake dead people on the floor which made me cry my eyes out. The Principal did this for a reason. he said it's because ""There are school shootings and this is what can happen"" and blah blah blah. I don't play I take everything serious. I'm sensitive also  And when someone ""jokes"" around like this it's not okay. I Have another one when I was in gym. we're running laps and we have a lock down. our gym teacher turns off the light and 40 kids duck down on the Long wall because there's alot of people who have the same schedule as me and we have the same gym periods and stuff. Anyways so we get on the Back wall my Gym teacher turns off all the lights which made me panic kinda because we don't have any Windows and by this time it's pitch black in the gym. I'm in the middle of my 3 best friends and we're on out phones I'm telling my mother like ""Mom I'm freaking out were having a lock down"" She texts back ""I'll pick you up early tell me when it's over"" She texts back.  this wasn't fake it was real.  So I was so scared for my life there is 3 ways they can get in the gym the back door the side door or the front door. I was near the back door and I felt like crying. there was Loud banging on the back door. it wasn't fake because there was a person yelling ""I'M GOING TO KILL YOU ALL I HATE ALL YOU BEEPING KIDS I'LL KILL YOU I SWEAR"" A man voice kept yelling I kept texting my mom and saying ""Mom mom there is a man who is banging on the door near me and I'm about to cry mom help!""- I kept sending her. ""It's not a drill mom I'm scared for dear life I might have a heart attack and sezuire a panic attack I don't know!"" I kept texting. my mom stopped responding which made me even more nervous I sweated alot that my hair was wet. The banging didn't stop till 12:30 And when it started it was 11:40 When the lock down was over and The Principal unlocked the door I remember crying my eyes out were I couldn't even Talk my talking was horrible I was stuttering and I had to spend the afternoon in the office. My mom came LATE She said she fell asleep. did she think I was walking home by myself? omg I was beyond frustrated but those are my 2 experiences with School shooting drills and a lock down BYE Comment yours 😂"
"6366","Kids should never have to worry about a person coming into their own school and possibly shooting them"
"6367","I don't have shooting drill"
"6368","Y'all got like a hundred tables in there just baracade the fucking door for geez"
"6369","If I was there I will swear like mad"
"6370","3:48 small balls?! that's cute"
"6371","😑"
"6372","Damm we don't do shit like that some dude just rattles the door knob. There's no dude shooting fake guns and screaming. Probably because it's mostly a Hispanic high school and there's almost no white quiet kids."
"6373","Taking them out around corner or reloading is best.A few were stopped."
"6374","People don't realize the kids and teachers at least have a better chance fighting back than sitting in a fucking corner to get mowed down"
"6375","I'm glad I live in the U.K. where these drills do not need to happen"
"6376","This is stupid, they'll probably do it way too much and the kids will eventually keep thinking it's a drill, and if it is real they won't think it"
"6377","For the drills, we shut up and hide under our desks, which is pretty dumb. If they walk in they can see you, its nowhere near safe"
"6378","MY GOD DAMN FRIEND IS DEAD"
"6379","In fourth grade we had a lock down over an hour long because a teen from the high school part of the school brought a gun.  It was honestly terrifying as we sat there, I was nine at the time. But we stayed calmed because after thirty minutes our teacher started quietly talking to us about California to get our minds off it."
"6380","6:13 that was some warcry"
"6381","ZIONIST propaganda = terrorism! All those shootings are FAKE!!!! Wake up already and start using your brains!"
"6382","When you mess with the squad 3:49"
"6383","I've been through multiple bomb threats,  people saying they saw someone with  gun etc.  And the school is so shitty about it, and it's a waste of time for the cops too. Our teachers wouldn't let us text our parents to tell them we were fine, they made kids stay in the bathrooms witch didn't have locking doors, just the stalls, get mad if we were scared. We aware just kids, thy could have treated the whole thing alot better"
"6384","I always kindve like the drills, especially when teachers would actually try to get in the rooms. It was like living a horror game because it was scary but safe."
"6385","At my school we don't do any of this. My teacher told my class if somebody come shoot us the school it's just going to be our time"
"6386","I dont really know if bullet proofs vests are expensive.. but why not just give a teacher some bullet proof vests and have the teacher tackle the shooter that way? When they were practicing for the drill and the teacher was tackling the guy with the orange gun i can see that the gun can hit her anytime if it was real.. Or in the easier part.. why cant they just have guns and kill the shooter lol"
"6387","At my old school we brought in canned foods to throw but now we just pick up our books"
"6388","But what if your going to the toilet? 0_0"
"6389","At my school we stack everything in front of the door and if we're in choir my teacher said he'd pay for all the MacBooks if we threw them at the shooter"
"6390","Well maybe if it was illegal all over America to carry a gun in your bloody pocket, these drills wouldn't be necessary."
"6391","Yeah...nobody's going to attack this school, the only ones will be ones without drills"
"6392","We only do fire drills at my school, 2 times a year."
"6393","I would of been like ""Cash me ousside, howbow dah"""
"6394","One time my school held a unexpected lockdown drill. Scary x200 is how i would explain it."
"6395","I would of bit the person"
"6396","The only REAL lockdown (not drill) that my school had was at lunch, <middle school I'm in 7th grade> and it was raining.  There was a hobo sleeping in the boy's bathroom... the police were called and we were locked in the cafeteria."
"6397","they throw fucking softballs at the intruder what the fuck is this"
"6398","Brush if they say it's a drill my teachers just like be quiet and keep working and we're like well this helps"
"6399","once we were in class our teacher was getting ready and she left out of the room to the other classeroom the guy who broke in broke our door and i was behind the door and i had a water bottle that was made out of metal and i hit the bottle on the guys head everyone walked to my teacher when she came back and everyones like ""SHE KNOCKED OUT THE PERSON"" I got an award from knocking out the person i was only in 1first grade like BRUH.I made myself popular after dat"
"6400","Tgis once i was 6 and i was in K2 in my school and someone broke and and he said ""IMMA KILL YOU ALL"""
"6401","I'd smash a window and run away 😂. What's sitting in a dark corner gonna do besides make you a bigger target."
"6402","give the teachers guns. BAM solved."
"6403","That teacher holly I think will probably make a difference"
"6404","It's just so sickening that we have to prepare for such horrifying things. Why should we be afraid? Why must we be in fear that someday, this is what might happen. It's just so sad that we have such human beings who want to take away the lives of innocent people. :/"
"6405","if u don't fight u have a 100 percent of dying if u do fight u have a 50 50 chance of surviving cuz if a teacher attacks the shooter a student could use a object as a weapon and attach the shooter the could even stab the shooter with a pencil on which hand the shooter has the gun"
"6406","my teacher has a gun at her desk"
"6407","At my school the teachers just twist the door knob, say nothing, and then walk off"
"6408","I had a real shooting I got shot I'm in the hospital  right  now"
"6409","I'm going to start bringing a synch bag and keeping ketchup in my bag anyone else?😂"
"6410","So stupid these drills are so pointless you can't train for something like this if the guy has a gun you don't have much leverage it may save lives but no matter what someone will  be getting gunned down someone will get killed so it's a failed excercise every time in my opinion JUST BAN GUNS"
"6411","Remember kids, if you don't want to be murdered by your school shooter, BE your school shooter...






...wait, no!"
"6412","In 2nd grade, there was a lock down because a shooter with a gun, that was I guess a robber. I don't know all the information. But my class and I thought it was a drill! But it was a real lock down. I was scared to death!"
"6413","I would love to be the guy doing the drill"
"6414","GRAB TEXTBOOKS and bags oh and RUN if you can attack the teacher and kick them where it hurts he is trying to kill you stab him with pens"
"6415","nice work teatcher"
"6416","mabe"
"6417","it would not work they are not ready for the real thing"
"6418","I'm dead jumping out the window"
"6419","Grow a fucking pair. Do you think the shooter will be nice, and kind during a real event?"
"6420","yes kids, if you hide under your desk like a sitting duck the shooter, won't see you. nevermind the fact your in plain sight, these guys are blind!"
"6421","this prob sounds demonic af but id use my classmates as meat shields"
"6422","I'm like an....army soldier in front of my teachers so I'm pretty disciplined but if I would get people out when they make noise...well..uhh I would be the only one in there"
"6423","How does 20 people hiding behind a desk count as safety?"
"6424","if a shooter went to my class I be like *took my knifes out from my bag* ""you mess with the wrong bitch""."
"6425","What? Iv never hade a shooting drill"
"6426","alls we do is hide behind the teachers desk and my teacher just pulls the shades down for the windows and doors"
"6427","In lockdrills our class don't hide in corners because you are just sitting ducks and it easy for the shooter to shoot the kids"
"6428","lmao this is so extra our schools is like ""shooter drill"" and the teacher locks the door. For ""code red"" drills, we lock the door and arnt aloud to talk for like 5 mins, not even leaving desks... thats it"
"6429","You know that's not safe to stay in school why someone is shooting a gun that is so stupid☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️"
"6430","there was a lockdown at 9 it started it end at 4 cause  their was murdered and 2 bank robbery plus their was a man in are block"
"6431","this is a great program. anyone who says that it is reckless is the same type of people who think that it is perfectly fine to just sit there and get shot. this is saving lives."
"6432","just me who is thankful that I live in Britain as there isn't as many shootings ??"
"6433","The teacher is really Lucky that she did not die in the columbine tradegy"
"6434","When u live in London and u don't get these"
"6435","We had a drill, my freind cringed the shit out of him. the ""shooter"" well he was fake. he accidentally shot my teacher"
"6436","Screaming"
"6437","I had a lockdown at my school and we where with the the French teacher and she didn't have a key for the room and the principal opened the door and everyone was dreaming"
"6438","My highschool had an active shooter drill. The swat team came and a fake bomb even went off. The seniors had fake injuries and the juniors were supposed to be actors. The thing is, they made it so planned it was really stupid"
"6439","The difference between America and Canada. American lock down drills have a guy pretend to shoot you going into classes with 8 year olds in them. Canada we just hide in a corner of the room, someone pulls the handle to make sure it's locked, and they move on."
"6440","My class has a big closet, so if this was to happen I would climb on the drawer, then on the closet, and to the ceiling I go."
"6441","The fighting back thing would work if they were like older than 11"
"6442","If nobody is in the corridors, the doors are all locked and blinds down it's pretty obvious we're inside the classes. The issue is that every man and his dog know how these procedures work, meaning that anyone can exploit them."
"6443","teaching teachers self defence lmao"
"6444","teacher:ok if he enters I'm going to grab his arm and you guys need to shoot him with tennis ball cannon *man enters* teacher: everyone fire!!!! *students start firing tennis balls
* man with gun: aghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!"
"6445","Doing drills all the time makes it seem fake

Edit It would help though excuse my old comments

Edit: Excuse my really really old comments :/ doing drills all the time might make it were the kids don’t take It seriously"
"6446","the other day we actually had a guy outside of our school with a shot gun with him and he was high asf so we were on lockdown for who knows long. we had like 5 cop cars in the end"
"6447","I once had a real shooter drill and i was trying to protect my crush and the shooter knocked me out"
"6448","Ohhhhhhhh noooooo poor little kids fuck the school for trying to save them"
"6449","My class practiced a lockdown once. Except she doesn't pull down the shades(because it will be obvious that people are in the class) and we all hide before the bookshelf so when the shooter looks in(the door is locked) he won't see anyone so he just leaves us alone."
"6450","Yo my school needs to start to do this"
"6451","My class had a drill today and I was surprised my class was quiet they tell us to cover the doors turn off the lights and sit in between the doors"
"6452","greatdude25 That's very mean To say that to someone,  they can take that deep and commit suicide and if I did it would be all your fault just saying think before you write."
"6453","Shyana Hemingway pussy"
"6454","Shyana Hemingway Don't bother, mate. He's just being a bitch. Anyway, I honestly feel like you could sue the school for scaring the animal Jesus out of you. I mean, fake dead people and the gunshots could definitely trigger something, maybe like an asthma attack. Christ, dude."
"6455","+Magical Cat Hey you know someone who has issues with there body and with there life and who has depression that really hurts. I'm going to remember that."
"6456","Shyana Hemingway sensitive gay faggot pussy"

"6464","JR Niemczyk Outrun my gun."
"6465","I am now YANDERE....."
"6466","Sure youre not still in 2nd grade?"
"6467","I MEAN SHOOTER NOT TEACHER DONT STAB YOUR TEACHER"
"6468","Potato we used to cover the doors with tables and chairs and hide"
"6469","Potato exactly, we need to be hiding in closets and actually locking the doors lol, i have polished concrete tables and my teacher boi says he would tip them like a blast sheild if there was a shooting"
"6470","Foxythepiratefox lmao"
"6471","This is the fucking problem. We are accepting school shootings as completely normal and natural as if it's just a part of fucking life. No, American government, the problem is our fucking gun laws and the easy access to guns. We need to make it harder to access guns - you have the right to them, but there are regulations. Just like you have the right to the freedom of speech, but there are regulations for safety - no shouting 'fire' in a public place without a fire.

Stop preparing us for school shootings, and start defending us from them."
"6472","I want my teacher beat up the shooter and my classmates too yaaaa we win!!! and kick his balls"
"6473","In my middle school a few years ago a kid came into the gym, because it was cold outside so we were in the gym and he came in, he reached into his backpack and brought out a shotgun and shot two kids and injured a teacher, but a teacher talked him into putting the gun down and I was there for it all so yeah, its pretty damb scary
By the way it was in new mexico"
"6474","And there's shit heads laughing."
"6475","Once I have a chance to leave I will"
"6476","Z"
"6477","If that happened my teacher would shout ""OVER HERE"" and run to the other side of my THE room and we practise to run and sneak behind things without being heard and fight"
"6478","My school doesn't, and never had a drill"
"6479","When I was in kindy we did a practice drill and he had to put down the blinds turn off the lights and hind under our desk and SOMEONE WAS LAUGHING And I was like WHY THE HELL U LAUGHING ITA NOT FUNNY and she's got,in trouble"
"6480","The schools need to stop teaching kids how to be quiet and hide, there's roughly more than 1000 kids in an average middle and high school and in the situation there is most likely 2 gunman or one. 1000 to 2 people. Kick their ass. Even if it means you might get shot or injured. Do what you have to do to save your life!! Stop hiding start fighting."
"6481","My school is so dumb all they do is lock the doors and put the blinds down and turn off they lights and shove us in the corner, like that oh yeah a school shooter will just be like, damn its locked and lights turned off better walk down the halls where 12 more classrooms have the same thing.. maybe they arent here.. BETTER SHOOT IT UP NEXT THURSDAY"
"6482","That school shooting training attack thing wouldn't be that easy.. as soon as you grab the guy in real life he would be punching the shit out of you"
"6483","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun"
"6484","i feel so sorry for people that have to go to school in The USA"
"6485","this is not helping no one but those lazy as school who are afraid to address there bullying problems
these drills are to calm the frightened parents and to calm those parents who's been on there asses about there children being bullied this is'nt going to change shit but to help the bullied kids where in the classroom to aim there guns"
"6486","Props to the teacher."
"6487","The problem with these fucking ""drills"" isn't the fact that it's realistic, it's the fact that they haven't taught kids how to defend themselves, but instead, they've taught them how to sit and do nothing."
"6488","The hole world has gone mad now they have shooting drills. For get this crap I am going to home school my son so I don't have to worry this is bull crap."
"6489","Now im glad that i bring my phone to school"
"6490","BRUH. my school just locks the doors and shuts the lights off. telling us to get in a corner lmao. but my science teacher makes us stand by the doors so attack"
"6491","I always think about piling a shit ton of desks behind the door."
"6492","Perks of living in Britain"
"6493","Just duck and lay down instead off getting out off the window we lay down and duck."
"6494","jesus, ive never been in a school lockdown before"
"6495","Unreal... lockdown drills. We never have those, earthquake and fire yes. Our schools are open for any passerby to enter, thank goodness it is safe here."
"6496","In The U.K. We don't get many of these cos guns are banned so the most we do is a fire alarm drill😂😂"
"6497","Just don't go to school. Easy solution 😂"
"6498","Teacher: ""Students let's sit in a dark corner with the lights off"" 

Me: ""Nawwwwww I'm jumping out the window and leaving this place"" 

Teacher: ""You will get shot!""

Me: ""BOI we're sitting in a corner with the lights off""

Teacher: ""Good point"" 


By the way my door is right next to a gate that's unlocked during school hours."
"6499","I would cry if I ever had a lockdown this intense. The day after Sandy Hook three people were in the woods behind my school with guns and I live in CT so the swat team came, I was so scared for me and my sisters."
"6500","There was a murderer running to my school and I was in a lock down for 3 hours"
"6501","this happen to me like 3 days ago and it is so scary"
"6502","I wish our lock down drills was that lit lol"
"6503","why did they have to mention the meme shootings (Columbine and Sandy Hook)"
"6504","One time last year I was in 6th grade and when we were outside before school started we had a lockdown and there was a man with a gun on campus. So we all his in the classrooms and my teacher let us play on the computers and we were on lockdown for 3 hours"
"6505","😬🔫😌"
"6506","When I was in sixth grade me and a bunch of other kids were in the gym and they said we had to reseal each other it was me and my best friend who is a boy were left and they said that we had to help the teacher if the teacher was not enough."
"6507","we have these metal poles in my bio class and my teacher tells everyone to grab one and he waits by the door wielding one of them himself"
"6508","when I was in first grade we had a lock down and we have color green and red cards of our room number green means everyone's ok but red means someone is missing like in the bathroom and we stayed there for over 20 minutes and a police man was trying so hard to open the door but couldn't and I was so scared and many people cried from this but what am angry about is my parents knew this was going to happen at my school at 11"
"6509","Thats why i love living in canada."
"6510","God forbid our school ever has a school shooting, I hope it's during 2nd period when I have choir... the amount of shit in the room we can use to seriously injure the gunner (literally throw all the brass instruments at them XD) + the fact that there's an emergency exit that leads right to the parking lot, ugh I just hope I'm lucky if that ever happens lol"
"6511","Last year, there WAS an actual shooter at my school. I accidentally threw a pair of scissors at a teacher thinking it was a shooter LOL"
"6512","he has a AUTO pistol"
"6513","that happend to me too"
"6514","I think I'm the only one but the lady who husband almost got a ticket sounds like nattalia from wwe"
"6515","Once people put Ketchup on to resemble blood and they had to look like they were in pain"
"6516","what if it was a skilled military gunman. remember the dallas shooting with a ex military veteran. yea, lets see how that works. when i clear and search rooms, i dont point arm all the way in classroom like that guy did, i check my sides.. just saying"
"6517","What if there was a real one and the students think its fake so they mess around like for real..."
"6518","they should do that at my school"
"6519","I hate when they don't announce its a real drill and the you find out a crazy fuck with a shotgun was roaming the school."
"6520","Hey what's better news man for them to give up and die or for them to fight for their lives and maybe survive."
"6521","but I thought schools were gun free zones...aren't they safe at school?"
"6522","Our school only makes a code red announcement, we lock the doors turn the lights off, and don't open the door for anyone. Like the worst that happens is they knock on the door and we aren't supposed to answer??? This drill is so extra??? Wtf."
"6523","If there's ever a mass shooting at my school I kinda hope that I'm either in my chemistry or culinary class because I'll have chemicals and knifes."
"6524","i am a kid watching this and if it was a real shooter i would be scared i probaly throw the heaviest thing i can find and that might be my binder and throw it at a person with a gun.  But i am agreeing on this drill and the teachers being taught how to fight an active shooter.  Even if afficiouls say not to be a hero i think more people will live if a student even is the hero teachers would probally be more the hero but i agree with this.  At my school we do drills and the first one i had of this my social studys teacher was like right by the door.  I asked him why he was doing this and he said ""if there was a real code red drill i would sit here with a heavy book or even a chair and if a shooter comes in he would try to hurt the shooter.""  So even if teachers arnt trained they are still ready to be a hero even if told not to in that the conclussion would be even if one person or kid is a hero less people would die or be insured"
"6525","yo I am still crying about sandy hook my god perect them"
"6526","Yeah, thats a good way to get someone killed"
"6527","I feel like posting this on the web will make shooters know what we would do"
"6528","My class was screaming and we were 5 minutes late for the drill and my english teacher pulled down the blinds and was scared and only two student and me got a table and pushed it on the door and my english teacher got mad and told us leave it and then are head teacher opened are door and we all screamed"
"6529","They could have locked and baracaded the doors that would delay the shooter and give more time for the police to get there"
"6530","This is why teachers and school staff should have backround checks and be trained and beable to be armed in schools"
"6531","Fascists at work!"
"6532","i would never hide in a class, wtf. When he comes in u fucked."
"6533","6:20 lets be honest. He wasn't fighting back. He could of punched her and knock d her out XD. Teachers need tasers or something"
"6534","The best defense in a school shooting would be for each classroom to have a solid metal door with a deadbolt and metal shutter. Then, when the shooter comes, that door is closed and the kids use an emergency exit out a window or something. This would essentially trap the shooter in the school and let all the kids out to immediate safety. Better yet, there could be a deadbolt on both sides, so the shooter always has a barrier no matter the direction he comes from."
"6535","that's an awesome dad 130 MPH"
"6536","lmaooo, anybody notice the kid at 0:51"
"6537","I wish we had one of these at our school because my school is soo loud during these drills, and doesn't take them seriously at all. I just want to be safe man"
"6538","It's not alwase a gun my school got attacked buy a guy with a axe"
"6539","Level three lock down is where the kids in the classroom get away from windows and doors and into a corner, or sometimes under tables. Level two lock down is where no one can exit the classroom but work can be continued quietly. This is what goes for in my district, I'm not sure about the others."
"6540","My school is shit!!!!!!! Shityyyyy schoolll"
"6541","Ok if you are going to have one of these pleas let the people know it's jut a drill ."
"6542","you should train the kids in ninja-ism... not sit them in a dark corner..."
"6543","Guys my friends died at columbine it's not funny!!!




They knew a lot about guns..."
"6544","My school only does fire, earthquake, and lockdown drills, but I guess lockdown drills can be counted as school shooting drills."
"6545","At my school we don't have someone with a fake gun we just have tho police come and unlock all the door of the classrooms. Also when I was in 3 grade my teacher kept a baseball bat in cSe it was a real lock down"
"6546","I had a lockdown at school today"
"6547","What bout Sandy Hook?



Nvm I don't wanna talk about it, it's too sad"
"6548","how bout you get armed guards and give teachers an option to carry firearms at schools instead of this idiotic play dead and huddle into a corner useless bullshit."
"6549","tbh these lockdowns are crap if he or her comes in the room everyone is dead, they need to teach students how too jump out to window or something."
"6550","we've never had drills like this at our school. we just have one campus cop and if we were ever to get shot up in our school, he'd probably be one of the first ones shot"
"6551","No one gonna mention the fact that it's become so common in America to have shootings that its come to this, practising in case another crazy guy tries to shoot up a school. Talk about the second amendment all you like but you can't deny that no other 1st world country has this problem."
"6552","Why do they sit them in a corner? They're just gonna open the door and kill you like wtf"
"6553","It's unfortunate that this is becoming the norm."
"6554","My school scarcely does these types of drills."
"6555","We played rock, paper, scissors when there is a lockdown.
*SHRUG*"
"6556","In a drill at mine I disarmed the ""shooter"" and knocked him out accidentally.. I was 16 at the time and I had to go to the principal halfway through when people were still doing the drill... It was so awkward"
"6557","I can't even fucking believe that there is a need to practice for a school shooting??? Like how messed up is that??"
"6558","The kids in my school yr7s are like 4 foot tall 😂"
"6559","I would pick up something and start stabbing the person or knock them out."
"6560","We have been having drills since before I could remember, and people just talk and giggle during them. You would think that during a real lockdown students wouldn't talk and giggle but that isn't the case. There was a shooter and we weren't told why we were under a lockdown so nobody actually cared. Guns need to be taken away for gun violence to stop. Lockdown drills need to change and be taken more seriously for student safety."
"6561","I dont know about lockdowns until now. Why not flip over tables for cover or barricading doors? I'm just wondering. Curiousity"
"6562","in one ACTUAL lock down, these 2 girls started to fist fight over a place to SIT. so me and another studnet got up and shut the up by giving them a slap across the side of the head.  we didn't hit them hard but it was enough to make em stop. they both sat down staring at us so we said our sorrys. and it all happened in under a minute."
"6563","lmao my fuckin class is so loud, we'd be dead in three seconds ~ there was this one guy that screamed, ""Fuck yourself, you pussy!"".. The class burst out laughing and we all had detention"
"6564","I'm. It even kidding at 4:40 that girl with the grey hoodie was my pe teacher want proof ask me I have my year book"
"6565","One day America will join the rest of the world in the 21st century, but until then they can enjoy burying their kids after mass school shootings!! MORE GUNS FOR KIDS! Learn to shoot before you can walk!! KILL KILL KILL!!!!!!"
"6566","I feel that the training when the teachers are fighting back is super super helpful if a shooter comes hiding in the corner is going to do nothing but help the shooter but if you fight back then he won't be able to kill as many as they do"
"6567","My class or Savavge bitchs but that guy come through our class fuck they well shit there pants hahahah"
"6568","I rather Figth than sit there and watching everone die"
"6569","My last name is Tate"
"6570","Cause when I'm in a building where people are getting shot, I want to hide in a dark corner out in the open"
"6571","ANY KIND OF DRILL"
"6572","peter Katz it's a song"
"6573","Orsss wtf dude that's cruel..."
"6574","Orsss we have drills all the time and we do not know when they are coming one day 4 police men arrived and started shooting. p.s we are in 4rth grade so we had to hide underneath the teachers desk and the other kids had to get there desk form them together and hide behind them"
"6575","Orsss all the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run, better run, faster than my bullet"
"6576","Jaden s Same,my science teacher has a golf club and he can just smack the shooter"
"6577","to*"
"6578","+NotInfractioN Actually we did. Nobody was hurt, it was just some psycho in our school's parking lot with a gun LOL"
"6579","I highly doubt you had a real lockdown."
"6580","paul bonethruster Oooooh, I get it, nice job, troll'ed me hard"
"6581","Removing kebab since the beggining of time ya think!?"
"6582","Really hope you're being sarcastic there pal."
"6583","Removing kebab since the beggining of time but it's gun free! you can't have a gun there....the entire town of Chicago is gun free and it's working great there!"
"6584","Because of course the shooter respects the fucking law: ""gun free zone? Lemme just throw my weapons aside and kill with my fists"""
"6585","Timblegoorn Problem with this is where are the kids gonna go after they run out of the class, cops are slow as hell. And if there is two then you'll have one banging at the doors and the other waiting to pick off any that hop through the windows"
"6586","Take away guns? Are you fucking dumb? Taking them away would HELP the fucking shooter, as there millions of ilegal weapons running around the country, plus, ""taking away weapons"" would screw up hunting, which would cause overpopulation and starvation of animals."
"6587","21 century? Fuck no, the century of god knows how many genders mentally disabled feminists create? The century of blaming the white male for everything while black people destroy/kill themselves?



Meh, would rather stay on the ""last century"""
"6588","Im a high school student this is the only way to drill into our heads how real this is. Nobody takes it seriously if it is not like this"
"6589","I'd take a book and hit the guy in the head while the teacher tries to put him down"
"6590","That would scare the shit out of me"
"6591","at my old school we'd turn off the lights ,lock the doors, huddle behind the desk but before that we all had a role assigned to better protect ourselves. for example out of 30 kids 5 would shut the windows and curtains, 7 would grab the action of desks and chairs closest to the door and stack them up against the door in a way so that if a gunman tries to open it they would fall on top of him, 1 would take role and ensure everyone was okay and getting into their positions as some people would have major anxiety in these situations and the rest of us would grab texts books and stuff them under our jackets and shirts as they are super think and can protect you a little bit more. Each one of our classrooms had walks talkies so that the teachers near us could communicate and we took many precautionary measures to make sure everyone was and safe, quiet, and calm as could be and it worked relatively well when people took it seriously as they should."
"6592","Ooooooh BOIIIIIIIIIIII"
"6593","This happened when I was in 1st grade it took 2 hours to get them away"
"6594","my friend gos to that school and me and all of my other friends go to the school right beside it"
"6595","Even though the teachers did their drills, what if a shooter was brock lesner?!"
"6596","Erm should I be kinda worried we don't have drills only fire drills 😬😬😬😬"
"6597","At my old job as a high school security officer I was part of the creative process in determining the best options for reducing the potential for casualties by as much as possible. All I can say is, when you're trying to figure out how to do that, it's the ONLY thing that matters. It doesn't matter how. The things shown in this video are some of the plans we implemented because they drastically reduce the possibility of people being killed. It's not about saving as many lives as possible, it's about reducing as many deaths as possible."
"6598","Yea great idea ALL hide In a corner.....




So when this shooter does come in he can get them all easily af and if he shoots in that area he's not going to miss NICE 1 TEACHERS"
"6599","Once in primary school (About 4th grade) a shooter came into are school, and went to my classroom door first and stood at are door for 10 minutes knocking, and screaming at us to open the door, and right before he fled, he somehow managed to break the window in the door, and unlocked the door and my teacher knocked him out with a baseball bat. And if you were wondering why the police weren't there yet, it's because my school was way far away, like on the out skirts of town, and the police didn't get here till like 20 minutes after my teacher knocked him out"
"6600","why do they hide in one place? all the students are trapped in a corner and they can all easily gt shot. spreading around the room can limit the deaths or injuries."
"6601","What a fucking backward country, 160 active shootings since colombine?! Americas stupidity is shocking"
"6602","What about Special-Ed schools? Would the students react differently or what. Because if they have severe conditions or there disabled.......... ;-;"
"6603","We never had these kinds of drills at our school. We only talked about them...What WE were supposed to do was lock the doors, turn off the lights, jump one by one out the window, then run to the church. The teachers said we could take any route that we felt was best. Be it through the forest or on the road. I would probably take the forest because what person would go through the WIDE OPEN ROAD that could possibly have cars driving through! If there is an active shooter then your best bet would to go to the forest were nobody could see you and if they did then they would have a hard time shooting you. I still feel that its a better idea than crouching behind a desk with the lights off and hope the teachers know how to kick some ass... But thats just me..."

"6619","i actually dont see a problem with this either. i mean im not gonna lie, it is a little traumatic and scary esp if it was with my kids. but i know me as a child, i would get over it..maybe some stuff arent necessary but for the most part even having an actor come in the room just pretending to shoot as long as he doesnt say anything might show them why this is serious. 

a lot of schools have doors that lock as well when closed to protect students from school shootings so for those who feel like they are just sitting ducks, the shooter has to be able to get into the classroom as well. i would think that most shooters would prefer to go after easier targets than to try to force open a classroom and shoot people. climbing out the window may seem like an easy escape but you have no idea how many shooters there are, who they are and where they are. they can easily shoot you while trying to escape, they will have the advantage because they will most likely see you before u see them, at least in a classroom you lessen the odds of running into them"

It's important to know what you can do to prevent be killed in an event like this. If I were in this, I would be scared shitless, but at least I'd be prepared for a real event if it ever happens (and I pray to the gods that it never does). As scary as this is, it's reality. People do this. It's time to actually be prepared instead of just sitting waiting to be killed."

Throw stuff, my teacher has pepper stray, some kids will be breaking out the window, and my teacher is gonna run over to the guy with some baseball bat that she keeps in a cabinet.*

The parking lot had strange people wandering around holding their weapons incorrectly so they had no experience with the weapon in their hands.  There was no sense of urgency in the videos taken outside the school.  The school was in horrible condition with mold and water damage in the classrooms.  There were no seats or desks for the students to study at and there were no books in the library.  
Next comes the state's bizarre action of making a special law suppressing all evidence in the case.
Next comes the Democrats trying to use SH to pass laws giving the gov't the right to decide what constitutes the press, trying to pass laws making it illegal to say SH was a hoax.

Yes I know about the Bill of Rights, I know about Madison, I know about the Louisiana land purchase, I know that he went against having a national bank his entire political career and suddenly changed his mind once he realised the nation needed a real Armed Forces. As for the ""Bill of Rights, it is not the most important document to Americans, and if you think that's what upholds American values then you have a very dim view of the fire at the centre of the hearts  of REAL American patriots, not pretenders like you..I am British, we wrote the Magna Carta (Your country didn't even exist) we wrote the petition of right, we wrote the Habeus Corpus, over a 100 years before James Madison was even born, the Bill of Rights is just a copy and paste document from European folk long before your time, the fact you glorify a document just shows how far the average American has strayed from understanding what being an American is about, it's not about glorifying an amendable document you plant pot. Values are not born on a piece of paper, it's why the UK has an uncodified constitution despite how old as a nation we are, we don't need to be reminded of what our rights are, we are born with them, they are not given to us by a piece of paper written 100's of years ago, as much as you don't need the 10 commandments from the Bible to know what right and wrong is, or do you?. Grow the fuck up, I am a classical liberal, as were ALL of your founding fathers!! The fact you have used the word ""liberal"" as a derogatory term, while at the same time glorifying a document wrote by classical liberals! The irony and ignorance you are displaying is frighteningly funny, you need to get to grips with what ""liberal"" actually means, before you think it's some kind of political insult. Honey, I have met other Brits, French, and German people who are more American than you ever will be. Consider this to be an ass whooping, take it on the chin, learn from it, and move on. For the sake of the American you might have to fight shoulder to shoulder with in WW3, the good old fashioned American term, ""get your head out of your ass"" would apply to you."

I helped design the radio bearer system inter-connecting 52 FOB's in Afghan for the USA called Kestrel, I even won a ministerial award for it in the UK, and helped saved lives being taken from the IED threat, both British and American.

Your first response, straight away, before you have ANY information on my political stance, says ""liberal"". You don't even know the definition of the word liberal do you? How is it, that you think that is some kind of derogatory term? You have no clue or empathy on how these terms differ when speaking internationally do you?

Liberalism has lowered itself to the lowest forms of humanity because they are not getting their way and have no valid arguments, but I digress, and I i cut some slack due to the nature of this event.

I heard about some of the conspiracies and as a former member of the military and purveyor of propaganda, both sides, I decided to research this on my own, open minded and start by watching the reports with no assumptions going in, and first report I came to was this CNN Gem, breaking news.  Amy, Please enlighten this poor vile delusional nut job who is a member of the masses, the following:

First thing I noticed, why at 0745 (on the CNN clock) they are reporting an active shooter situation, which in hind site is over by now, very calmly I might add, then, (LIVE CNN FEED REMEMBER), they proceed to show the updates on the website happening at 0745 PDT about kindergarten being closed and no mid-day bus run?  The shooting took approx. 5 minutes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting)  starting at 0935 - 0940 EDT.  Who updated the webpage of the school during a lock down and an active shooter situation taking all day long before it was cleared and investigated?  This is just my first pass, I have not even read the conspiracies or anything, but CNN either is incompetent, well this is a given, or something is amiss.

Also, I have watched the live video feeds from every news station I could find and it strikes me odd in comparison, I keep seeing the same videos on every station, even in other countries?  Same officers, Same kids, only about 12, and I don't mean same from different angle, I mean SAME VIDEO.  In every other active shooter scenario I have seen, and a couple, I have seen live, as I am in the military, (5 police officers were senselessly gunned down in Baton Rouge recently), WHY are the police cars not running their light bars on their cars?  There are no Ambulances, I saw two I think maybe three, a couple blocks down.  There is no emergency helicopter and generally no sense of urgency?  People lumbering around on cell phones, doing circles, not really doing anything, when they do not know if there is another shooter? or did they know there was not???

Amy, go watch the columbine video.  Those people are HAULING ASS to get out of there, cops are everywhere in ordered fashion ordering people to put their hands on their heads, guns at the ready, the shots of the FBI, I see, they are not even properly carrying their weapons in a safe fashion around a school?  One gentlemen does not even have basic range safety and is caring two weapons, one pointed toward the sides?? Not up or down, but into where the crowds would be?  Is he a trained police officers or someone they put in a uniform?

Where are the claimed 500+ kids being evacuated? Again, see columbine, how, no buses remember, and I do not see any buses on site??  The roads are blocked by random cars, not emergency vehicles and they are not that many of those with no lights on.  I see not one single body on a gurney?  You would think they had the decency to bring the bodies out and not let them sit where they died all day??? They cancelled the bus run?? The rally point was down the road over a mile at the fire station, nobody is moving with a sense of urgency and the medical setup, not ONE SINGLE BODY IS PUT THERE, not one Iota of blood is shown.  

I have seen war hastily put up medical tents and active shooter sites, there is blood everywhere!!!  It gets on everything, but this site is pristine, like it was just put up and it has been there all day long the more videos you watch.  Again, I will keep an open mind, but where is all the money going for these families?  They are still getting donations from people like you?  They have no funeral cost any more, no loss of income?  Why 5 years later are they raking in Millions of dollars for this?  To fund the Anti-gun lobby?  Shouldn't someone investigate the money? Did it fund the Clinton Global Initiative? ""Never let a good crisis go to waste"" - Hillary Clinton

Just some thoughts......I have some more videos to watch.

O.k.  Time YouTube 28:25 they just reported a news affiliate SAW a couple kids with facial wounds and one with a hand wound?  No video?  These are journalist? They have an ASS-LOAD of reporters on the ground, everybody and their mother has a video phone, yet, we cannot get a clear shot of someone with blood on them????  They keep showing a picture of a map split screen with a picture of a parking lot with a Jeep, but I do not think it is the school?  I am not sure whee that jeep is and they are not explaining.  WAIT 40 min. in and on scene, at least I think, I see yellow tape and a bored guy with an FBI wind breaker?  How did the Feds get there so fast?  Where are the Newton and CT police??

Now, gunman dead, 2 handguns recovered, wait, from Wikipedia, it said  he killed them with an AR-15???  How did the Police report 2 handguns mistakenly for one very noticeable AR?? O.k.  I am intrigued, still open minded it is early, but where do I go from here.  Any suggestions???  Thanks, SSG Austin"

It's a lovely place in many ways but if you cant see a problem with the fact that you can just go into a store and buy a gun at any time then there is something wrong with you. However. People will kill if thats what they want but perhaps making it a little more difficult to get guns it could have been avoided. And also stop bullying."

Those two bastards of those who fired on unarmed and pissing and afraid at the arrival of the police and shoots himself in the mouth. Nichrome not feel sorry for them, I'd be twice pissed their parents and their graves. They are worse than those jocks who they ""offend"". To shoot at unarmed stealth a lot of brains and courage do not. They are worse than those inflated students who scoffed at them."

"7067","what about in Petal,Mississippi"
"7068","15 deaths?, I thought there was only 13 deaths at columbine"
"7069","Holy shit, way to go Watchmojo.  I mean, it would be one thing to discuss these shootings in a meaningful way or report them, but literally ranking them, and then placing the numbers of deaths and injuries like cute little scorecards and determining which one is the worst.  For fucks sake Im almost surprised that you didn't put in a ""honorable mention"" near the end or add some shit cheesy joke like ""someone break out the hydrogen peroxide because there was a LOT of blood to scrub off that day"".

I guess they are not quite shitty enough to joke about mass murder, but just shitty enough to rank mass murder in a top ten list with fun graphics and upbeat narration.  This isn't even a joke.  With a straight face, they went off and ranked literal murder.  

And everyone is just fine with it because these massacres have become nothing but a statistic in shitty youtube content to shove in your faces while you click on a more interesting video.

Just look at the likes, too.  15k people didn't think that this was a shitty thing to do."

"7346","Watchmojo- Ya know who cares that most our content is rediculous comedy lets make a video based on mass shootings where we are as impersonal as possible to guilt views and shares out of viewers at the expense of those affected by these tragedies. If we play sad music than no one will notice how much money we made. Thanks Ank I just had to post this on the video."

"7394","Honesty you must be retarded if you actually think real shooting is even remotley close to video games. And saying that video games cause kids to do this. Why did they use bombs? Bombs are efficient. Not Fun. They did it just to get the job of killing done. Saying that video games cause violence is also saying that people shoot up schools for the fun of it. Thats not true"

"7406","the Waco Texas incident would be on my list"
"7407","this shits sad that people take their anger out on innocent people FUCKING BABIES are being killed"
"7408","I'd say the same exact thing Marilyn Manson said. At the time of Columbine, in my opinion, anything psychiatric related pretty much sucked. Brooks Brown even stated that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's parents could've searched through their kids' bedrooms, and had their parents done that, maybe Columbine wouldn'tve happened."
"7409","9 days later..."
"7410","4:50 No, you dumb bitch, it was so American citizens could defend themselves against the British. Now that the British army is a joke, the second amendment is redundant."

"7421","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run better run faster than their guns"
"7422","most of these killers are white"
"7423","Maybe I'm biased bc l live in Blacksburg, VA and was on campus during the killing spree.. I just dont understand how 32 deaths could be ranked second to the 15 of Columbine.  All life is precious and it isn't right to put a  value on human life but literally twice the amount of innocents were killed at VT than columbine i can't comprehend how it was the number one worst massacre?"
"7424","okay we all know COLUMBINE would be here"
"7425","What the heck what about the shooting in sandy hook elementary where LITTLE CHILDREN lost their lives at an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL shooting!!!!"
"7426","All the other kids with the white caps on, better run,better run,outrun my gun!"

"7430","jesus christ, alot on this list are near me
i live in a city nearby killeen, although i used to live there, my mother used to be in the army and she often was at Fort Hood

"7434","*Intro starts* ""what's a shooter, without his gun? Hi this is watchmojo and today we're lookin at the top ten most successful shootings in the u.s"
"7435","They blamed him for the shooting? Da fu why?"
"7436","play this at my funeral: all the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run outrun my gun"
"7437","pumped up kicks"
"7438","list should be updated with 2016 orlando massacre"
"7439","Well this is fucking tasteful: making money off capitalising mass shootings."
"7440","just so many people are sick. its sad how they can kill so many people/children."
"7441","I feel sad now"
"7442","Orlando Florida would have been on this list"

"7452","Statistically Virginia tech was greater than Columbine... GTFO dick rider."
"7453","I do mass shootings in GTA V so I don't ever do it in real life"
"7454","The Columbine School massacre wasn't caused by video games, bullying, or goth culture. If you read the journals of the shooters, especially Eric Harris, you would see how evil they were. Harris would talk about brutally killing people and raping women passingly, not even in a fit of rage, just as a normal idea. His psychotic evil is comparable to that of Ted Bundy. It was sadism, not all this other trivial bullshit, that caused the massacre."
"7455","where is the sandy hook shooting kappa"
"7456","I'm kind of sad Omaha didn't get on this list... and he was only 22..."
"7457","wow, if this had been uploaded just over a week later..."
"7458","this is why I dropped out of college and became a cashier at McDonald's"
"7459","Cool!"
"7460","Columbine will ALWAYS be the most iconic of ALL rampage killings. Yeah, there have been worse but Eric & Dylan were the OG school shooters and basically paved the way for future killers. They even predicted they would have copycats and followers in the tapes they recorded. But I don't think any of them compare. 20 years later and Columbine is a household name."
"7461","If only these people could've been stopped this list is very sad"
"7462","wait..  WHAT?!!?!?.. columbine massacre is so famous"
"7463","The thumpnail is the best school shooter meme picture ever existed"
"7464","pumped up kicks better run better run faster then my soles"
"7465","You forgot the Von Maur shooting in Omaha, 9 people were killed."
"7466","It's pretty screwed up how people can do this to others"
"7467","well i assume that watchmojo was ummmm 9 days off"
"7468","I love how virginia tech was gun free but that didnt stop tha guy from bringing a gun"

Lyrics
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid
Yeah found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden oh in a box of fun things, I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet"

"7676","If you are for gun control, then you are not against guns, because the guns will be needed to disarm people. So it’s not that you are anti-gun. You’ll need the police’s guns to take away other people’s guns. So you’re very pro-gun; you just believe that only the Government (which is, of course, so reliable, honest, moral and virtuous…) should be allowed to have guns. There is no such thing as gun control. There is only centralizing gun ownership in the hands of a small political elite and their minions.

"7764","Guys, the reason Columbine is #1 is because it was the first major school shooting in US history and other shootings have been inspired by it, like the Virginia Tech shooter said Eric and Dylan were his heroes. Also, gun culture changed rapidly, more people were starting to call for gun control and speaking out against the NRA. It increased security in schools, bands like Rammstein and Marilyn Manson got blamed for it when they had nothing to do with it. Again, this list isn't how many died, it's how legendary and infamous it was. When people think of school shootings, Columbine is probably the first to come to mind"

We have the most guns and yet mass shootings continue. But yet these folks say ""guns don't kill people....people kill people"" Well go off and fight in a war and see how far you get without a gun. I can say with 100% certainty no gun nut American will ever do it. 

As for our right to bear arms, let me know when I can own my own nuclear weapons. All these gun nuts would go crazy if we were all able to actually bear any arms. But yet they think their guns are going to protect them from the government if it ever came down to that. One missile fired from miles away and the only good a gun would do is for that person to shoot himself before the missile hit."

The majority of people in prison are actually the white supremacists, whereas in America they seem to be everywhere. What do you mean we won't be a free country in ten years? We won't be a free country in two years thanks to the 60+ year old nationalist cunts who fucked us over, and the biased voting system. You say you could overthrow the government if they go rogue, so why is Trump not dead yet? What do you mean take back England's government? It's been fucked from the beginning, so have most governments (including America's). The only problem is in America they don't realise it. Trump is racist. Attempting to block certain countries from entering your country based on the population's general ethnicity is obviously racist. Trump is racist towards Mexicans. Generalising them as rapists is also obviously racist. And finally, we won't be under Islamic rule in 20 years because virtually the entire country seems to be blaming the Muslims right now for all the terrorism. When I made this comment the country hadn't quite been ruined yet. Luckily, I have a Finnish passport so I can go there if everything goes to shit, and at least I can accept it whereas Americans don't seem to be able to. Indeed I am trying to be politically correct, but then again, so are you."
"7900","Sal Ami lmao. How is the mass rape in England? How is it that you can't be non Muslim in prison or you will be killed? How does it feel that you won't even be a free country in ten years. The whole point of the second amendment is so that if our government ever goes rouge we can overthrow them. You really think you could take back England's goverment with sticks? Trump isn't a racist. He doesn't think all muslims are terroists. That's a lazy and stupid point to make. Do you know how many Muslim majority countries there are? He temporarily banned 7 terror prone. Didn't ban Dubai where they don't blow themselves up as often. Islam needs a reformation. Christian s and Jews did it now you don't see mass crime In the name of those religions. He put up the ban until they can create a proper vetting process. Yet you still think that's wrong right? When isis said they will get in any refuge program. And do you think trump is racist to black people or Mexicans? Trump has done nothing but help black people in the United States. Everyone protesting about an open border. Do you want America to be like Mexico? No they would rather protest our country then fix their corrupt one. And atleast Mexican immigrants can adapt somewhat to our society. Your country is literally falling apart and will be under Islamic rule in 20 years yet your to busy trying to be politically correct."

"7914","This is a common mistake of causal relationships in multi variable situations. If we are to take the history of all of these nations and assume that the only real difference here is the availability of firearms, that is radically missing the boat in terms of cause and effect.  Over simplification of problems as complex as this are not effective, it just turns it into a screaming fight."
