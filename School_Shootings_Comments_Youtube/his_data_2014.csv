"1","I love that! Watch till the end its really funny. I wish my school had drills like that"
"2","arm the teachers"
"3","this is so sad and horryfying :( I'm glad my country has strict gun laws"
"4","This is retarded to teach them kids to just stay put and your a okay. Well like columbine the shooters had pipe bombs and the people that died were the ones that didn't get the fuck out"
"5","I see why they are questioning if a teacher could actually take down a shooter.  Some probably couldn't.  But life isn't perfect and easy to deal, especially in a shooting.  I think the trainer was fairly clear they only advocated trying to take down a shooter if : a) the shooter is reloading, and b) all other options were exhausted.  No, it might not work, but I think it's better to have some knowledge of how to attack a shooter than not, if a teacher and their class were cornered in a classroom, sure to die otherwise. "
"6","Well clearly the shooters gonna look under the desk and shoot thats what exactly Eric and Dylan did with shotguns just imagine that "
"7","The lord is the only who can protect the kids not the police half the departments in the US don't even no how to respond to a active shooter.."
"8","This is what happened at sandy hook "
"9","yo fucken florida man "
"10","we have drill similar soon as we go in lockdown we rush to barricade doors we put everything possible up by the door to barricade it then we find the closest object to us then if an intruder we use what we have grabbed against them on top of the barricaded doors"
"11","I think kids should be taught the eastern european or gulag way to deal with the shooter- everybody rushes onto him and together beats the shit out"
"12"," 
""In England, we don't have high school massacres. Because we have strict gun laws...""

Because the fucking culture is different. The worst part England could never compare to just an average bad area in the US. First off even before England put into place strict gun laws the weapons on the streets illegally in the US was higher then the guns in the UK period.  I fucking hate this arguement by the British. Our culture and the people in our countries are so different its not even comparable. Yes there are tough places that I wouldn't just walk freely and not worried at all in the UK but you ever been so some of our Cities like Detroit, Chicago, Inglewood, Oakland etc.

While NYC is the one city that has created a lot of strict gun laws and ""some"" violence has gone down. Did you know even then Thousand carry weapons on them Illegally because its still a Dangerous city to be in if you work or get caught up in the wrong parts. BTW the UK especially England yes your right you dont have school shooting and I applaud you on that but facts show ever since you put that gun ban into place your crime statistics have gone up. Sure not many Gun related issues but overall it has gone up."
"13","Yeah we had a drill and we were in the computer lab all huddled up in the corner of the room and my friend got the best spot under the desk and i was like trying to scoot under the desk and I heard banging and I was scared for my fucking life"
"14","Silly people"
"15","1:52-1:58 is me middle school in methuen MA timony grammar school"
"16","We have these on our school. 
But their Called school lock down
Its when a predictor enters the school and we hide in classrooms in a corner u noticed by the door or windows."
"17","Just like fire drills active shooter drills should be random and unplanned. The more realistic the drills are the better prepared people will be for the real thing."
"18","This is a liberial program at it best.  idiots."
"19","Why don't we give teachers guns. "
"20","This used to be a semester routine where I went to high school"
"21","It's kind of sad  that we have to have school shooting drills honestly "
"22","My school is full of idiots a group of kids thought it was funny to snap and dance in a drill and it takes my school about 8 mins to get hidden so basicly if i am in a real 1 im gonna hide in the closet"
"23","lol white people"
"24","In this video: teachers, drill sergeants, parents and kids trying to impress others and each other. 'I'm on tv!'"
"25","Shooting drills, high fences and secured classrooms, detection systems, armed teachers and security guards. americans :/ At my school it was all about paying attention in class, study, learn and having fun."
"26","Screw that I bring my knife and stab him or just run out"
"27","There could be more guys in that room how would they be able to take all of them down"
"28","I cried when the teacher started to talk about the thought of anyone hurting the kids."
"29","Why don't they install metal doors in each class room so the intruder can't get into the classrooms "
"30","Looking at those kids, it actually brings tears to my eyes that they actually have to go through this or worry about it. Any kids for that matter. To think our generations didn't really have to think about such things. Can't imagine."
"31","Staying in a group is so fucking stupid the shooter just needs a rifle with auto and bam some bullets go threw the kids."
"32","If a shooter came to my school I don't think any art majors would die because we have so many ways to get out with out being spoted."
"33","Wtf is this this is stupid and wierd"
"34","If these school drills can make a difference, and only saves one life, then it's worth it."
"35","Why are they laughing this is serious! Once your put in a situation like that depending on how you tend to react to certain situations you will choose to flee or fight or they will be too scared to even do anything. I don't know maybe they should actually try improving school security for once. Then all this wouldn't be necessary "
"36","Yeah.. Now since the powers that be can't hide the fact that most of these school 'shootings' were actually staged drills. They are now making these drills appear as normal everyday occurences. So if they get caught staging a shooting, they can just say ""Oh it was just a drill"". How convenient."
"37","My school did this when I was in the 8th grade. They literally didn't tell us or the teachers. They tried to send an email that it wasn't real but most of the teachers didn't read it so it was complete craziness."
"38","Poor Americans.... "
"39","All I know is if there's a school shooter on campus I'm not going to hide in a corner waiting to get shot. Walk into my classroom your getting a chair to the face and much more. All this don't be a hero stuff, it's called saving your life. I'm not going out without a fight."
"40","Stupid idea can't reamber what year this happend but there was a school shooter and a student went to his car grabbed his gun and shot down the school shooter now that could have happened to any cop"
"41","This is exactly what Sandy Hook was! A fucking drill that they passed off as a real event! Unfortunately,  now that the lead investigator mysteriously died, we may never get the real truth. The American people need to stand up against this bullshit that is designed to take your rights away! But they won't!  They're too busy caring about Kim Kardashians fat, slutty ass and Justin Biebers relationship status, to even give a shit about what is really going on! U won't get it, until its too late."
"42","I cried watching the teacher fight the shooter while he resisted. So empowering. "
"43","For me, I thought about scho shootings all the time when I was in high school (class of 09) I would look around my classrooms/cafeteria/library and think about ways to escape if someone came I to my school with a weapon. It's horrible that students have to think like this, but it has become nessecary! "
"44","School is supposed to be one of the safest...what happened!  When I was in HS, my buddies and I were concerned about how to approach a female and passing Algebra II-Trig.  This never crossed our minds let alone training for school shooting.  The world has gone and going more insane. "
"45","We all saw the fake drill at Newtown.  These kids should be scared Obama will actually need to produce some bodies in the next hoax.   "
"46","Plus they could easily get through windows. It would be a surprise too. Wouldn't be a drill until 30 kids and a teacher was dead."
"47","Are schools like from the outside. Someone on the inside. Has to open the door. Or the shooter would need a key. These school lockdowns though do not make me feel safe. Duck and cover? Protect your head. Yea a hand in front of my head won't help. Schools need better security "
"48","My school has the worst drills ever, considering that they call themselves the best school in the state, or nation. During a lockdown, they literally just shut of the lights since the doors are locked already. And they carry on class."
"49","How could you stay living in a country where school shootings are the norm?"
"50","OOOORRRRR.... You could just ban guns?! "
"51","I aint black and I wasnt racist in anyway and your state its god damn crazy"
"52","You fucking my state? Racist black."
"53","Chill..."
"54","+Brandon ellis true there is an always going to be some kid tryna get the gun."
"55","There is something called being insane. Some teachers are insane."
"56","+Jenna Blue  And people can't figure out for the life of them WHY parents who can homeschool choose to. 9/11 was scary enough for us at home, I was always glad I was NOT there the next summer when my neighbor pulled the fire alarm and watched all the kids panic because they thought they were under a terrorist attack, and he laughed his ass off that they were all crying and thought they were going to be killed, and then the possibility in more recent years than that that some kid or some adult is gonna come in and shoot everybody because he's a worthless pansy. Kids do NOT need to grow up in that environment."
"57","lel"
"58","+Morris Falker  Thank God for homeschooling, it's the ONLY place common sense thrives in children's education anymore."
"59","+ronan sweeney  Parents are already paying out of pockets for school supplies, books, any sports uniforms/equipment, PLUS they pay hundred of dollars a year for the privilege of just having their kids signed up FOR sports. Somehow I don't think their priorities are in order."
"60","+TheBookWorm1718​ im sure they could do something in which the parents would found towards, parents will be more than happy to insure there child's safty "
"61","+ronan sweeney  Where're they gonna get the money for that? They already subject us to 10,000 bake sales and car washes just so the cheerleaders and football players can get new uniforms all the while they can't even bother making sure each kid has their own set of textbooks, there's no budget in saving lives."
"62","+Vance Stone I doubt that they will successfully tackle the shooter and if they do well they need to face some objects like chairs table other stuff too."
"63","Yup like sitting ducks they want em .."
"64","+darian fernandez "
"65","Well in Canada we dont have this and I hope we never do"
"66","This is about safety you idiot"
"67","Racist."
"68","True"
"69","How do you NOT pay attention to school announcements? I have no sympathy for these dumb parents whose kids have cognitive and attention deficit problems. I really hope the school punishes these dumb kids for not paying attention and for causing all this unnecessary trouble."
"70","This is good. I agree with this. "
"71","How about stronger doors with better locks! This is now more money for these contractors! Doors that can not be kicked in or opened without great difficulty wood do more to save lives than training people to throw themselves at a person hone mad!"
"72","Prepping the kids for martial law smh"
"73","Probably the same as if it was real because they pass drills off as real"
"74","It's america! Of course you need gun drills!  "
"75","Its so sad that American schools actually need school shooting drills...."
"76","just locking the door and hideing behind the deck thats it thats not safe at all if someone is insane inough to do a shooting at a school dont you think its too easy for him/her to find the kids if there not in reces there in class and then there stuck in a room who can be easly be broke down if the door was suported by the decks than good "
"77","I am so glad because of my Jewish privilege. It's hard to beat. My children go to a private institution unlike JEWitt academy. The chosen ones are not subjected to such violent scenes because it is harmful to their spirit."
"78","+BlueFlame Saiyan because the board of education said so."
"79","so why are they preparing you like that when in real life you are going to do something different"
"80","Thats what I told some of my teacher but they said if it was real we would just go a different way."
"81","+koliop941 anti semite. you are being reported to the ADL. you will be sentenced to 1000 years dungeon for you intolerance."
"82","Piss off. Take your religion back to your synagogue. Don't shove it down other peoples throats. This is the internet where people come to laugh, not worry about religion being forced upon them."
"83","+Aylin Kuru  lol I know it could just be a troll but i head nothing to do so i just want it to see if i can troll a troll .It's ok my English is way worst and it my first  language. XD"
"84","+bryan740710 Sorry for my english btw, I'm from Germany soo.. xc"
"85","American ads seem alot blunder and more ""desperate"" (so to speak)than British ads!! How it seems any way..."
"86","Kenny Grimes I just hope u never have children and if u have heaven help them having a piece of shit like u as a father"
"87","Cannot believe the irony (if that's the right word) of dark knight rises ad on this video...still sandy hook was only weeks after aurora.....where are all these psycho nutjobs coming from????"
"88","anyone who thinks this is a hoax is a blithering idiot!!!!!!"
"89","Fuck this broken healthcare system"
"90","people calling conspiracy theories, I hope you get to tell these parents that their children dying was fake. I'd love to see the beatdown that happens after."
"91","Sandy hook equals HOAX HOAX HOAX. Since I said it 3 times it must be true"
"92","Do you idiot promoters even realize that 3 of these 8 year old  ""actors"" when asked on national TV if they HEARD gunshots ( Dr OZ show)  from a high powered rifle ( people on shooting ranges used EAR PROTECTION since the noise is so loud ),  

the girl said she heard police walking on the school roof and NEVER mentions gunshots! "
"93","Wow, I must really be a glutton for punishment. "
"94","What is your proof that this is a hoax?  Show me actual proof, not your conjecture bullshit.  Show me bank statements, phone records, tax records, birth certificates, ""actors"" appearing elsewhere, show me something that isn't your bullshit conjecture ""proof"""
"95","https://m.facebook.com/HoaxAtSandyHook?refsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&_rdr

Join people"
"96","Please compare the news coverage of this shooting and more recent shootings (I.E. the Marysville, WA shooting that happened today RIP).  You will notice that the response to this shooting was relaxed and not urgent at all.  Bodies werent being rushed to the hospital, trauma helicopters werent called.  Only a handful of students are shown being evacuated from the school.  All of these things are polar opposites in more recent, more real feeling shootings. "
"97","2 handguns, specifically a Glock and a Sig Sauer, recovered. No mention of the AR-15 that was ""used"" for the shooting. Interesting to say the least."
"98","at 1:09:36 the time is 11:43 AM ET (bottom, right, CNN logo). Alexis says she heard police on the roof, but the first real evidence of police on the roof is recorded by CSP dashcam 837 pt 2 (on scene and recording 9:53) at... amazingly... 11:43. Are you sure about that Alexis??"
"99","The parents didn't suffer, they have made thousands, upon thousands of dollars by pretending their child died. That's why there hasn't been any lawsuits to date.

I've put the 3 police dash camera's side by side and went through the police reports, and found there was no mass evacuation of the 575 students. No EMT's or rescue workers, just a couple of police officers walking around. When CNN says @ 14:00 that nobody's being evacuated, that's contradicting the official report.

Stop being ignorant and face the truth. Read the report. Look at the pictures and videos. Make a choice based on the information, not what you're being told."
"100","What an ignorant cop at 17:00.After 14 years he still calls the Columbine shooters as the trench coat mafia. Such ignorance such dumbness."
"101","SANDY HOAX"
"102","quick question, if sandy hook happened on 12/14/12 then why on the FBI website was the incident report released on 12/13/12 and why does Adam's ( the shooter ) death cert say he died on 12/13/12?? It doesn't make any since!!!"
"103","They were just babies."
"104","Not a single mention of this since then, what a shame"
"105","Dear God, CNN takes a lot of commercial breaks."
"106","The people who say these shootings are hoaxes make me so angry . A shooting happened at my Highschool a few months ago, and people said that was a hoax . My friend died . They aren't hoaxes . They are very real. "
"107","Awful."
"108","I work for schools with kids around that age, I almost had to leave after hearing the death toll of children, I could hardly bare looking at them knowing what happened just a few states away."
"109","would it possible to re-upload this video without the commercial breaks ?   "
"110","Breaks my heart the kids who lost their lives didn't get to spend the holidays with their loved ones. "
"111","CNN interviewing the kids. WTF! "
"112","NEWTON ? Dumbass try NEWTOWN  NOT NEW TON GOOD LORD"
"113","CNN lies. I have found them lying about reports."
"114","bedengen o noa lik let a9729183"
"115","That was a very horrific day for Newtown, especially the fact that the school had K-4th graders."
"116","lol he got a pretty high kill score. Too bad he didn't make it higher. He should have taken out another room before blowing his brains out."
"117","This is why law abiding citizens should be able to own firearms. If our Gov't takes our firearms only the bad guys will have guns. We cannot defend our children with bb guns. Use you heads people."
"118","These parents? Please. 
EVERY LAST ONE OF THESE LYING TREASONOUS FUCKERS SHOULD BE LYNCHED!
Peaceful enough for you?"
"119","From 1:12:34-1:12:54, Alexis Wasik looks very confused at all of the fakeness as I can not blame her."
"120","Does anyone question who actually OWNS the mainstream media? Whoever believes the mainstream media prior to say, 2005, and continues believing it even to this day especially needs to wake the hell up by now. If you don't know what I'm talking about, your computer is right in front of your face."
"121","Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips."
"122","Just watched ABC's live coverage on this event... Very Disgusting!!!  Can't believe this!!!"
"123","Forgive me, I'm in England. Why so many breaks?"
"124","The anchor should have cut off his guest, given the nature of this story, as in ""Sorry, but we have to cut you off now; we have a report that there's been a shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut...""."
"125","Thank you very much for sharing these breaking news videos.  If you have any more available, I love to see them - especially any more Boston Marathon bombing videos from the manhunt.  Thanks again!"
"126","the only facts here was Sandyhook is in CT."
"127","Has the security footage been released yet?  I don't watch tv 'news' but thought looking at the coverage would bring insight.  Boy was I wrong.  I made it through an hour of this video.  Where are the paramedics rushing into the school after the shooter died?  Where is the footage of ambulances speeding to the nearest hospital?  They claimed the school was on lockdown for over an hour, yet the first live footage was absent of paramedics.  Showing the school security cam footage would clear up a lot.  "
"128","it must be hard to stop all the hoax children from seeing the msm"
"129","+grungedog3 umm someone is ignorant."
"130","Why does Alexis' dad have his hand around her throat? Has he been arrested for child abuse yet?"
"131","Hoax"
"132","+Awakened89 Your point is mute as your are assuming things that need took place. Focus on the lack of first responders. Notice the entire road in front of the school is blocked with cars. Would NEVER happen in a real emergency. "
"133","time zones in the usa range to 3 hours ahead or behind dumbass!"
"134","Maybe because  time zones are just a simple mistake you dumbasses"
"135","Cause this so called 'shooting' was supposed to take place on 12/13 and someone didn't get the memo... "
"136","They try and get information during the breaks."
"137","+Liv Basile
Is that what Jesus would say? You goyim are all the same."
"138","Dont you ever joke about something like that you are a sick sick person and needs to go die "
"139","Who said the Gov't was going to take firearms from people in the first place?! Please inquiring minds would like to know because otherwise, you are spewing shit to cause unnecessary chaos.
Just to save your time but most especially mine skip citing any bullshit from FOX bka FIXed news."
"140","+ausador just a fucking stupid asshole, huh??? How much do you guys get paid???"
"141","Just the hate."
"142","The mainstream media has deteriorated since the fairness doctrine was struck down.  Now it's all politically motivated commentary with very brief moments of semi-truths all presented in a way to make profit.  There was a time when networks expected the news to lose money, but it was considered very important so it was kept.  There are still independent journalists with their feet on the ground getting the story as it really is.  The real journalists have 2 enemies, the MSM who refuse to present their stories in a non-sensational manner, and on the other you have conspiracy theorists who believe they have the answers for everything making bizarre connections they present as ""truth"".  The actual truth lies somewhere in the middle.  Finding real news is hard and takes time.  You have to filter between corporate noise and insane people.  But buried deep amongst the information rubble, it's there.  Not as rosy and CNN presents it, and not as bizarre as Alex Jones presents it."
"143","the government does. in the NDAA bill it says that propaganda is legal. that means the government can say WHAT EVER they want to and get away with it."
"144","they just tell you what report. government is the biggest cooperation there is. warmongering, drug running, human trafficking, mind control, propaganda. oh, and the 'new' NDAA says that propaganda is legal.
 "
"145","Because we aren't socialists, government doesn't fund broadcasting."
"146","Money money money. That's why one reason I love football (soccer) one commercial break in 90 minutes."
"147","+TimStarz04 go away"
"148","How do you know Sandy Hook is in Connecticut? What if the entire state of Connecticut is just a hologram Obama is using to make us conform to his health care laws?"
"149","+signalfire6 unless you're decapitated you assume people are alive and try everything to save them. Someone declared all 26 dead at the same time, only a doctor can declare someone dead in Connecticut. No emts where allowed to enter,no life support helicopters, a crazed kid with asbergers somehow got a 99% kill ratio....people forget about Natalie Hammonds fake ass. 99% of this country is stupid as fuck and I can't wait to see what comes next. You're all pieces of shit that deserve all of this"
"150","+signalfire6 that's not true"
"151","No security footage and the dead kids were all full of three to eleven holes apiece, in first graders. It was inferred that many or all had head wounds.   No need to bring the paramedics in to see that; a few cops declared them all obviously dead; a few that were still breathing or looked saveable were evacuated before the cameras arrived. "
"152","from what i have read and watched there was no security footage., then new cameras were installed. when asked who instated the new cameras, the newtown police department, or some one in charge of the PR said that releasing such information would be a risk for the children. KateSlate11 and TeamWakeEmUP have some very good videos on this subject. also check out Sofia Smallstorm Unraveling Sandy Hook. that is a very good video."
"153","Apparently not since that sang at the superbowl"
"154","+Carter Wale lmao....really?? You're the fucking pathetic moron that believes this shit. Why are you even here commenting???"
"155","You are living one sad worthless life puppetstr1ngs ."
"156","+Carter Wale You have family that lives close.....congratulations that means absolutely nothing. The only reason I got involved into this shit was to prove the ""conspiracy theorists"" wrong, it didn't take to long to figure out this was fake. Stop being a ignorant fuck and go look yourself buy you won't because you're nothing but a troll who doesn't even know what ignorance means, so just go back to being stupid as fuck"
"157","What like you? I have family that lives about a half hour away . It's no hoax . You're just a close minded dip shit."
"158","Watch the other videos of that family. I feel really bad for that girl......I know its one big fucking hoax but the thing that drives me crazy is the ""dead kids"" siblings. How do you keep them quiet for ever?? Someone real needs to talk to those kids."
"159","+suzier55 me too because you don't know what ignorant means. Go buy a dictionary you fucking moron."
"160","+puppetstr1ngs I love being proved right! "
"161","Did Huckabee just state that god is an asshole?"
"162","Maybe we should argue that these kinds of things have increased ever since the 1950s when they added god to our currency.  "
"163","+Sandra Crockett Thanks, Sandra, these people are trying to inflict a vile and hateful deity onto us by government force.  They are delusional and it was their ""gott""  in the ""gott mit uns"" that nazis emblazoned onto parts of their uniforms.  "

"165","Hey, no Christmas trees behind the firehouse in this video"
"166","First time in two years of video watching where the porta potties were where they are in this vido,nthey were they put there they were over by the check in sign"
"167","What time was this video taken? Behind the reporter there are porta-potties in front of the fire station that don't show up in any other photos or videos of that day???"
"168","Fake event!"
"169","6:30   :)"
"170","Personally, I do think they should make certain assault rifles illegal, however only the really good ones, such as the AR-15. I don't really care about the AK-47, as long as maybe if it's the civilian issued type, however the reason I have no interests in making the AK-47 illegal, is because AKs are inaccurate, while may be able to fire with mud in them, however parts in these things usually break, and thus with the AR-15 there are so many different useful accessories that go to this gun that it's not even funny. These guns can withstand more than the AK-47. Also because AKs can't shoot as far, because let's say a sniper has their gun pointed at you and you're being raided for firearms possession and the kidnapping of the mayor, you wouldn't be able to hit that sniper (well at least as not as well as you would with an AR), and contrary to what Joe Biden says, AR-15s are not hard to aim and hard to use, AK-47s might be though, depending on what you've got. 

AR-15s are more effective cop killing weapons than AK-47s. I know one story of a man who got out of his car during a traffic stop with an AK and fired 37 rounds at a police car with (I think) 2 officers inside, and the damn thing was so inaccurate that not a single bullet touched any of the officers. The gunman was shot dead by police. This was all caught on video. "
"171","San Antonio Texas! Mayan palace shooting. A female off duty cop prevented a shooting massacre with 4 bullets. And the perp survived to stand trial. look it up. "
"172","Looking for any doctors, authors, or researchers who know about mental illness for my podcast and can discuss mass shootings. Please contact me. "

"180","WOW. I've watched a few dozen of WatchMojo's top 10 lists, and for the most part I enjoy watching them. But the fact that they'd even make this one is fucking *appalling*. I know they say ""our hearts go out to the victims"", etc etc. But seriously, the very act of ranking tragedies like these is abhorrently wrong.

The only saving grace that could come from this video being made is if they donated every dollar they make from it to any mental health charities or charities that benefit the victims of massacres like these."
"181","number 2 should have been number 1"
"182","thank god that bombing failed to bad for all the lifes lost at that high school."
"183","The Columbine shooting really bothered me the most because I was in high school at the time when it happened, and I was one of those outcasts that got picked on too much and so many people thought I was capable of committing the same crime."

"189","Wow at the angry idiots saying take guns away. Lets just hope that the day never comes when you are hoping that someone with a gun(officer) makes it to your house before the criminal who doesn't care about gun laws find you... Like seriously, what will you do? Say ""guns are illegal"" and hope he/she understand their wrong ways, leaves and turns in their guns? Good luck."
"190","With the increased amount of bombers out like there (like: McVeigh, Una, Boston bombers, and Columbine killers) I don't think banning guns would help fully in prevention, granted the gun violence will lower mostly.  Is it amusing that most don't seem to care about the killer's mental state or attitude enough to say anything."

"200","What all you morons realize is that it's not the guns that kill people, it's the people with guns that kill people.  Making guns illegal or harder to get just turns into more people wanting to get said guns, just like drugs.  Gun control is not the issue here people, get that through your thick minded skull."

After about 9 months of research I believe that laws don't stop shootings nor do back round checks. A kid in Washington state recently went into his high school and shot i believe 5 people, one fatality but the gun was not his fathers, the gun he used was illegally purchased on the street. "

Rewind a little bit, to 1:40 ""52% say Obama would better handle taxes""... hmmm. I dunno bout that. I do know that my paycheck got much smaller due to Obama care that I've not used once.

This shit is tragic and the victim’s families and friends will never be the same as they are trying and find closure. Although with all the millions of responsible gun owners out their, these are still isolated incidents. While this will never add true closure to the family and friends of victims, the average gun owner/enthusiast is not a “soon to be mass shooter”. Shit hole countries (like Mexico, no offense) that have strike gun control laws, and continue to see mass carnage on a severe level. Same in Central America, and on and on. The media just magnifies every incident of mass shooting that occurs, while war torn inner cities see murder rates that well surpass these mass shootings over time. Don’t blame the gun; blame the few crazies, poverty, gang activity, drug trade, power struggles, etc.People have been killing each other since the beginning of time and will continue to, regardless of the gun or not."

No. Criminals will still be able to get the guns through illegal means anyways. If more people had legally obtained firearms and used them in self defense then less of this type of thing would happen, the gunmen would have been shot by someone already. Done deal. All that your ideas will do is make it harder for people to defend themselves against the people using illegal means to obtain firearms. "
"324","I have to ask this, but is all these deaths worth it? in the US you have your rights to carry arms, but is it really worth it in the grand scheme of things? How many lives have actually been saved because of your 2nd amendment right in reality? I live in the uk, and we have never had our kids murdered at the hands of kids getting hold of guns. Isn't it about time the laws are changed?

Let me ask this one question before everyone jumps on me. Do you really need the gun for protection or do you purchase/have a gun because it's your constitutional right to do so? Can honestly answer that your lives are in danger now and that's why you carry a weapon? Or is it simply because you can?"

Any gun that is black, look military and with a magazine that has 11+ rounds are call Assault Rifle. Any simple rifle with a scope attach is call a Sniper Rifle. Any long gun with a drum magazine is call a Machine Gun. Any simple handgun with a magazine 11+ round is call a SubMachine Gun."

"335","This just goes to show how nobody is safe from school shootings..........unless you live outside the USA then you're pretty much safe"
"336","No matter how many mass shootings there are in the United States, America will never get rid of guns, because any US President who signs the bill to illegalize guns will instantly get voted out of the white house in the next election, no president wants to risk that, American people wants guns because of MONEY !!! Gun sales generate billions of dollars of economic activity, for both gun manufacturers, and gun stores. Without the firearm industry, thousands of gun company/gunstore employees will loose their jobs, and a further BILLIONS of dollars lost to the already recession struck economy. Plus, nobody gives a shit about other people, strangers that you don't know and has never met, to get shot and killed, people who support guns only realize they're wrong when their own family or friend is shot and killed by the very guns they love and support for. Lack of gun control is the very top problem plaguing the United States by its Constitution, which was written 200+ years ago where society was like the wild wild west, no law enforcement, therefore, everyone needs a gun to protect themselves, but that obsolete 200 year old law simply doesn't apply or fit in modern society, but no president dares to change that law in fear of getting voted out of the white house and further ruining the economy, someone or something must stop this deadly loop of mass shootings being caused and protected by the US Constitution !!!"

"340","Ur not making sense for example right now u have a gun What r u gona do with it? Dont tell me to protect urself coz i  never heard some1 actually did protect himself with the gun plus if u realise in the states coz (guns are legal) makes the police there 24 hours feeling threatened wich is actually bad always the police shoot civilians even if they werent armed u know more than me that police murdered innocent ppl more than the actual murderers why? B coz all civilians are armed the police wont take any chances thats so stupid man in some countries police dont even have guns with them at all coz no civilians owns any, i live in dubai and am 25 years old i never ever heard of any shooting crime here at all 0 percent coz we dont sell guns to civilians"
"341","So make guns illegal and then no one will have them right?  Just like making drugs illegal stopped people from finding drugs.  And making alcohol illegal stopped people from drinking alcohol.  The second amendment was designed to allow the citizens to defend their other rights.  Giving someone the right to free speech does them no good if they use that right and are killed for it.  They need to have a way to defend their rights otherwise they are just words on a paper.  Lawful citizens aren't the people committing these crimes and it honestly makes me sick when they see all the hatred following them.  We don't blame every Muslim for 9/11, we don't blame every man for rape, so why are we putting blame on the millions of gun owners that haven't even gotten a speeding ticket for the actions of evil criminals?"
"342","Sandy Hook never happened. It was a hoax"
"343","This was uploaded like 10 days before that happened."
"344","Obvious troll is obvious"
"345","+AngelicLuff Lets replace guns with something else protected by the constitution in that sentence.  ""calm down no one is saying to take away your precious freedom of speech away.""  Just because you don't agree with it doesn't make it any less important to protect.  Just because I have never used my constitutional protection for a speedy trail by my peers doesn't mean that it can be mocked.  It is important to protect should I need it or if another citizen needs it.  The same goes for guns, it is protected should the need arise that one would need the right to bear arms.  

If you have any idea how to make sure that crazy or drunk people won't do anything to hurt other people please share the country and the world could really use it.  Crazy and drunk people are going to do awful things.  They have since the beginning of time, the only thing that you can do is make sure that you aren't going to be their victim. "
"346","calm down no one is saying to take away your previous guns away.We clearly need more of them if any random crazy/drunk can get access to them. You are right in the 2nd part though."
"347","This proves nothing of the sort.  That would be like saying that a list of the most drunk and disorderly people proves that we need another prohibition.  If you try and control people you are only going to affect those that are good people and are not going to abuse their freedoms anyway.  If there is an insane unstable child that is bent on killing people, if guns are harder to achieve do you really think that they are going to just forget it, grow up and become a functioning member of society? Of course not.  They could do any number of things to get the guns illegally or worse, manufacture some homemade bomb as has been proven in recent tragedies to be plausible.  

Attacking the people that are not to blame for these shootings is not the way to accomplish anything.  The first step should be to secure the schools and make sure that children are in a protected area for their education rather than a building with a sign out front.  Even if you make all guns illegal there are still millions out there and the technology to make them isn't going away.  If someone gets ahold of one and the schools remain unprotected than you are going to end up with the same result.  "
"348","Mass shootings are a fraction of the murder rate.  The bulk of murders in the US take place in cities with populations over 200,000 people by recidivistic criminals that are not going to listen to any legislation that is passed.  The fact of the matter is that no where in history has legislating against guns had any effect on the death rate in a country.  The UK has a low murder rate but they have had an even lower murder rate for decades even before any legislation was passed on firearms.  In short, the legislation had no effect on the number of people killed in the UK per 100,000.  Its a cultural issue.  When the object is targeted you are left with a very lucrative business for that object and criminals that are better funded and better armed than the people that they persecute. "

We do it out of jealousy, rage, self-defense, greed, and revenge ---- In today's society when people are already at the end of their wits, loneliness, apathy towards others is on the rise, making it easier for people to get guns will only do more harm than good."

I think that they should be taught more in dept for the more you know thebetter off you are and to be drinking, drugging, and fucking your sorrow away isn't the true reason. I personally think the American Diet is the way many eat and that mnentally affects us a lot for i ate that way and then went on a diet and I now RARELY have anxiety, a diet can affect you mentally as well as physically. I think that people are assholes and think people that are all mental in some way or another are the bad ones that commit crime and that should be stopped for normal people do to, so stop the steryotyping and shut your f***ing trap, I used to be mental and did I do something bad? NO so I think all of us should try to understand eachother a little better and this problem won't be solved but it just may become less of an issue!"

What's even worse is the response from rabid republican lawmakers, the LOOSENING of gun laws, no requirement for background checks, poor mental health services, and the increase in gun hunger in this country.

"449","+kyle sharpe what are you kidding me? Name me one other mass shooting that's worse than 20 kids and 6 adults killed? "
"450","yes they where and sandy was not that deadly compared to these ones :/"
"451","+Brad F Where is your proof? You cite one simplistic example and make broad sweeping conclusions without taking a minute to substantiate your claim.   Yes the US has the highest gun ownership per capita, however there are several nations that provide counter arguments.  Switzerland has a very high gun ownership and has a much lower murder rate than many countries in europe.  Russia has a ban on all guns and has one of the highest murder and suicide rates in all the world. 

If you were to take a look at the numbers instead of having YOUR head in the sand you would realize there is much more to the issue than a piece of plastic and metal forcing people to go insane.  For instance we can look at where most murders are committed with guns.  This happens vastly in cities with a population of over 200,000 and an average income of less than 28,889$ per household.  In the US there are over almost 20 cities that meet this criteria and in the UK there are 3.  The UK's murder rate is 2.1 per 100,000 people and in the US in areas that are NOT the cities that were mentioned before it is 1.7.  So, here we have areas of poor, heavily populated areas being responsible for the vast majority of murders in the US even though there are just as many if not MORE guns in the rural areas surrounding them and yet the murder rates in those rural areas dwarf those of the impoverished inner cities.  So the problem isn't the guns, its the people using the guns and the culture of the area that promotes killing to get what you want. 

Now one of the countries that has been talked about as having a great success with gun control is always Great Britain.  They as stated before have a murder rate of 2.1 as of 2010 compared to the higher US stat of 4.5.  Yet before their mass gun control measures were put into place you can see that Great Britain had a murder rate of 1.9..... So essentially the gun control measures did nothing to the murder rate in the country, Britain has never had an issue with high murder rate.  Making a law and saying it was the law that accomplished this is just a way for politicians to gain credit and thus reelection. 

If attacking the ""thing"" worked than there would be vast success with the current war on drugs yet you would be hard pressed to find a college campus without marijuana.  The prohibition would have been a raving success, yet we found that it only increased crime and victimized those that were using it responsibly while not having any effect on the addicts and criminals that didn't care about the law.  If you are going to make vast claims regarding a subject that you know little about you had better have more backing than having a correlation and immediately applying a causation.  That is ignoring all the bigger issues that lie under the surface of this topic and rendering human decision to inanimate objects and their imaginary will."
"452","+Colin Pitts
Unlike you I don't have my head in the sand. The US has the highest amount of guns per capita, almost double than any other country so it would appear that they are handing them out like lollies. You can spin it any way you like. You can continue to blame culture or mental illness or the person who wasn't given enough hugs as a child but the fact remains that more guns in society equals more gun deaths."
"453","Handing them out like lolls? Spoken like someone who hasn't ever been around firearms or firearms owners.  An FFL is required to be filled out with every firearms purchase as well as a background check.  Guns aren't the problem for the high murder rate, its the culture of america.  Otherwise everyone that had a gun would commit murder or a crime that is the definition of causality.  If guns are to blame for murder and crime then wherever guns are present you would expect to see crime and murder and that is not the case.  Use is only dictated by the user and the ones that use an object for good should never be to blame for those that don't."

Every single one had warning signs and in some cases the parents knew 100% the kid was mentally ill but couldn't do anything about it . "
"464","Way to be edgy, asshole."
"465","That's a loaded question. The right to bear arms has nothing to dowith public safety. So the answer to your question is ""infinite"".
Besides, these massacres (while tragic) only account for anout a thousandth of a percent of homicides in the USA, so focusing on laws that curb this one statistically negligable crime is extremely inefficient and illogical.

I read a fantastic ebook called ""Fraud in Mental Health"" by the Therapist that explains this all very well. The beginning of the book is about how tax money is wasted on the immoral with no results in change. But most of it is about what laypeople need to know that the mental health industry is not educating us about. Really great book in itself, but helped me to protect my children."
"520","The reason I believe school shootings happen is not the bullying, gun control, their past or anything like that. The main 2 factors in mass-murders are suicidal thoughts and being famous/god. They want to commit suicide but that would make them even  more of a failure if they just kill themselves. If they acted god and take peoples lives that would make everyone hate them, not to be disappointed at."

"523","Really tragic. As a European it strikes me as unnecessary to allow such weapons to the citizen. Of course army should have but not citizens, there is no war. In Ireland, possessing a gun illegally means an auto sentence of five years in jail. As a result even housebreakers don't have guns, only drug gangs, all in all the murder rate in Europe is a tenth of that in the US, Wishing ye well.  by the way its often argued that guns don't kill its people... yes it is but easy gun availability make it easier for angry people to kill, and guess what, they do... wish ye well! John  Lennon .. Imagine !"

even if the government banned guns only 15 mabey 20% of people would turn them in and then what do they do then, they no there are a hell of alot more out there so they start doing home searches and eventually leading up to a second American civil war and then most likely a good majority of the military will side with the people and the power in place would be taken down within mabey a month or two. and the people in power like being in power so dont expect a gun ban of any kind by the federal government any time soon"
"527","im not sure but i believe iv herd somewhere that in japan owning a fire arm is illegal and that japan has one of the lowest murder rates out of any country. Again, not sure."
"528","The irony of this all is that when their is a mass shooting anywhere, the government blames the gun. The gun didn't kill all those people the person did.
Secondly, honestly, the land of the free has too much freedom. I mean a man killed innocent people and got a life sentence for Christ sake! That should say something! America, congress, American people, everyone needs to get their heads out of their asses because it's not a hat.

"549","FOR ALL THE GUN NUTS HERE: A few questions

1.Do you ACTUALLY think gun controllers are trying to take all your guns, even though gun controllers have always said you should be allowed to own some guns like handguns rifles shotguns?

2. Are you actually that paranoid that you think the only intentions gun controllers have is to impose a tyranny and not in an attempt to save lives? Th.Whether you agree with if gun control saves lives or not how can you not see how some people would think gun control saves lives? Alot of arguments I hear is ""well obviously they are trying to impose a tyranny because how could anyone see at all how gun control could save lives""

3. Even if Obama did try gun confiscation how do you think it would be even practical? There are 300 million guns. It would be practically impossible.

4. Even if Obama did try to repress the population, do you actually think the forces would turn on you in an instant? Its hypocritical how many gun nuts on the right dont even trust their own forces to not repress and kill them at will yet they look up to and trust the same forces to invade and try to sort out other countries. The same guys on the right also advocate increased military spending, something which would not help the citizens of america at all if they ever did try and impose a tyranny.

5. And my main question, do you actually think the only thing preventing a tyranny is an armed population? Sure hitler mao and stalin did it to impose tyrannical measures but back then they didnt have anywhere near the military resources the american forces have today. America has piles of nuclear weapons, fighter jets and drones. They have a military which is costlier than the next 15 expensive militaries combined. The government could take out the vast amounts of the american population if not all of it with a few pushes of some buttons and some launch codes. If Obama wanted to impose a tyranny he would have done it by now already, and successfully 

My point is not only is it impractical to try and gun confiscate, gun confiscation wouldnt have to be done to repress the whole nation whatsoever. When gun bans were done and lead to massacres the army wouldnt have been able to repress without gun confiscating, something the US army could do with the vast amount of equipment they have. Even in the more recent times with for example the australia and british and irish gun bans when the population had been effectively disarmed no attempt to impose a tyranny was made, also like to point out these countries even rank higher in the world freedom index, despite a disarmed population. "

"569","What people like Suzanna Hupp, Wayne LaPierre of the NRA, and these other gun ""lobbyists"" always fail to realise is that the solution to gun violence is NOT more guns. if it was then America should be the safest place in the world with over a 1/4 billion guns floating around. Maybe if it wasn't easier to get a gun in the US that it is to get the common cold, maybe these then crazy people wouldn't be able to grab a gun and start shooting people. James E. Holmes ordered 3,000 rounds of handgun ammunition, 3,000 rounds for an assault rifle and 350 shells for a 12-gauge shotgun online as well as large capacity magazines and  bulletproof vests and other tactical gear without any questions raised and, according to the NY Times, it was as easy as ordering a book from Amazon. Last month, in a Texas Univerity, there was a guy whom went on a stabbing spree, he only killed 5 people and injuried 14, fact is that it's harder to kill in mass with a knife then with a gun, for one you actually need to catch someone to stab them, no long range kill shots. Also, with Columbine, everyone was quick to jump up and down pointing the finger of blame at violence in music, movies, video games and entertainment TV like South Park, alienated youth, goth music and fashions, & Marylin Mason but nobody pointed that finger a violence in news media, Big Pharma, the NRA, or President Bill Clinton. April 20th was one of the largest one day bombings in Kosovo, News media leading with stories of murder and disasters [ ~1.5x as many people are actually killed in car crashs and almost 3x as many from Alcohol then from Firearms, and over half of gun deaths are suicides], Eric Harris was on anti-depressants, and, while Mason cancelled the remained of his North American tour out of respect for the victims, the NRA meanwhile had a massive pro gun rally a few weeks after the shooting."

I don't understand people like that, we have the right to keep ourselves safe. I wish someone would have a gun when crap went down, again ... I just don't get it.

Secondly, a nuke is purely meant for destruction to everything and cannot be aimed, meaning that you would destroy yourself in the process of killing your attacker.  It has only one purpose  and function where guns have multiple.

"628","+TheSelfishAltruist You're missing a crucial fact on your gun homicide numbers. Almost 90% of them are illegally obtained firearms. Most of those gun murders are by criminals who use illegally obtained firearms that are either stolen or smuggled over the Mexican boarder. Full automatic AK-47's are illegal in California and yet gangbangers run around slaying innocent people, each other and police officers with them. You are missing another crucial fact in your comparisons with these EU countries. They have significantly better education systems and healthcare. Firearms bans are flawed policies that make people less safe and give criminals the upper hand. Your emotional response to firearms leads you to ignore facts and to provide a band aid fix to a cancerous tumor. If you want to discuss dropping crime and murder all across the board you need to talk about policies that improve education and our countries general health. Not to make law abiding citizens unsafe because they can no longer defend themselves from criminals, psychos and an oppressive government."
"629","+TheSelfishAltruist Yes you are replying on 2 different threads.  On the other thread i have already mentioned that britian does have gangs and drugs but at the same time due to proximity to the drugs and the availability/ size of the market that those issues are far less and as a result the crime involving the two are far less.  That is where your difference in death statistics is coming from.  Remember, its not the law abiding gun owner that is contributing to that 67%, largely it is coming from these gang and drug violence issues that are more present in the US opposed to the UK. "
"630","+TheSelfishAltruist Britain does not have near the same inner city drug and violence problem the US has.  The comparison of the two is once again completely and utterly flawed.  The violence is due largely in fact to gang violence which is still intentional homicide.  Freedom is defined as having sovereignty to make decisions for yourself.  Slavery can be safe.  Just because you are safe doesn't mean you are free.  You are safe in a cage waiting for execution but you are not safe wandering around outside where a whole host of things may happen to you but you are a lot happier with the latter.  Again, you talk as if taking away guns from the law abiding people is a sure fire way to reduce crime when no numbers support this claim.  

Im not making any claim that there isn't a violence issue in the United States, but it surely isn't due to legal possession of firearms or there would have been a dramatic drop in violence during the assault weapons ban and there wasn't.  There would have been a lot less crime when firearm ownership was lower in the beginning of the 20th century and there was more crime.  

Firearm ownership in and of itself is an expression of freedom.  You have the FREEDOM to posses a tool to defend your own life and not rely on another to do if for you.  Freedom is not relying on someone for your every need like protection, healthcare, money, infrastructure and a whole host of other things.  That is dependance and is the exact opposite of freedom.  You may believe you are SAFE but don't confuse that with freedom.  If you are happy being dependent on others there are plenty of places to go in the world with that mentality but not the US.

We may be a young nation but in our short time we have leapt ahead of our european counter parts and lead the world. We have done this by paving our own way not conforming to conventional thought and treating it like the gospel.  There is no correlation to any of the evidence that you have presented and until there is such scientific correlation, we have to make policy predicated upon what the people of the US feel is best for their liberty."
"631","+TheSelfishAltruist You say that getting rid of gun ownership would be more freedom.  In what world is having someone tell you what to do freedom?  Any of those countries you mentioned have markedly less freedom than the US because they allow their government to run peoples lives.  There is a fine line between running someones life and making them more safe.  I surely don't advocate handing weapons out on the street and there are measures in place ALREADY to help stop people with a criminal history from buying guns legally.  Like i have said many times, it is not the legal purchase that we have to fear but rather the illegal purchase or the illegal trafficking of guns.  That cannot be stopped by legislation and it is the primary way that people with a criminal history obtain guns or other tools for their trade if you will.  

Again you bring up the 12,000 number and completely neglect to realize that 40% of that number is suicides which could happen just as easily without a gun and another mass percentage which is not specified for this year yet, is criminal on criminal violence.  The left over amount is so small that it could be accomplished with any means not just firearms.  Getting rid of guns might simply result in the increase in stabbings or the increase in using pills to accomplish suicidal thoughts.  

We have a high homicide rate due to the prevailing gang violence problem and the market for illegal drugs bringing more lawless activity to our shores.  This has nothing to do with the lawful ownership of firearms and will not be diminished in the least if you tell lawful citizens that they cannot own them. 

To say we have 3 9/11s a year is flawed and offensive to the people that were involved with the tragedy.  Thousands of innocent people lost their lives where in the US it is suicide and drug shootings that make up the majority of gun deaths.  

The point of the matter is, liberty is the right to choose.  It IS an argument about civil rights, we have a right to own firearms which is spelled out in the document that was written by our founders for the people.  This right cannot be taken away without the consent of the people and the US there is no consent.  We want to be able to own what we want and defend ourselves with what we want.  Despite all the problems we have, we can recognize that 12,000 deaths is a smaller number than over 1 million violent actions prevented in 2010 by lawful firearm ownership.  "
"632","+TheSelfishAltruist Ok... So essentially your logic is that because .1% of people do lawless things with their rights we should get rid of them?  Under that logic what rights would we have left? Some people are going to abuse their first amendment rights to free speech and religious practices, some people are going to abuse their right to council in the court of law.  My question is why is it ONLY this way with guns.  Im sure you would never advocate for the banning of automobiles but a MUCH higher percentage of people abuse their ownership of them and far more people die as a result.  Far more people are going to abuse over the counter drugs and die from them. This is somehow the only issue that 0.1% justifies an all out ban and rights restrictions for everyone.  It makes no sense.  If what you assert is true, then you have such a small minuscule chance of running into a firearms owner that would actually shoot you (0.1% as you mention) that you would essentially have a higher chance of getting killed by lighting on your walk over to meet your gun owning friend.  Yet you want to legislate predicated upon this number?"

Why have a gun? and yeah, people say it's because they have to protect themselves .. but wake up, it's like almost only America who have so many school and gun shootings .. You hear about a new shooting like all the time in America .. And here in europe it's like: Ohh .. another shooting in America, that's not news... 
So if guns were illegal like in almost the rest of the world, then all these shootings would increase .. Because now if people are like mad or not normal then they just find a gun and go nuts with it, because it's so easy to find in America... it's possible to be safe without weapons.. 
And I really hope for America that Obama can help with it, because I think it's sad that so many people dies from these actions...

"862","Eric Harris was a psychopath but he was once a normal kid. It takes a lot of pain and torture to turn someone into a monster. Bullying is very serious and they are just one example of what it can do. 

One of Harris' last journal entries read: ""I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don't … say, 'Well that's your fault,' because it isn't, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. No no no don't let the weird-looking Eric KID come along.""
Dylan Klebold said on the Basement Tapes, ""You've been giving us shit for years. You're fucking gonna pay for all the shit! We don't give a shit. Because we're gonna die doing it.""

Accounts from various parents and school staffers describe the bullying that has been described as ""rampant"" at the school. Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, Harris's eighth-grade science partner, reported that Harris and Klebold were constantly picked on. Vanderau noted that a ""cup of fecal matter"" was thrown at them.""People surrounded them in the commons and squirted ketchup packets all over them, laughing at them, calling them faggots,"" Brooks Brown says. ""That happened while teachers watched. They couldn't fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it."""

"873","Well because its full auto. now if it was semi, then you could get it around $600."
"874","+Marcos Mendez how does a mac-10 or similar cost that much in a country where guns are very popular, even here in the UK where guns are hard to get hold of you can get a smg for 10% of the price you said? "
"875","If they do its not a legal modification. A full auto mac-10 can cost between $7,000 - $13,000 If bought legally. That cost to much for your average gangster."
"876","+Sahir Hossain I dont deny your point.  In fact i completely agree and there are several murders each year with tools other than guns.  People with intent to kill will find a way no matter what is at their disposal.  Just because it can be used as a weapon however doesnt invalidate the assertions for people to own firearms because they bought a bulk package of cereal at the market. "
"877","+Colin Pitts I see your point now. Guns are most effective. Okay, i see now. It's hard to endure purely made cone shaped peices of metal going through your shoulder. But MY point is, anything can become a weapon."
"878","+Sahir Hossain The point isn't that nothing else can be used as a weapon, its that a firearm is the MOST effective weapon.  Yes a 110 pound woman can grab a stick to defend herself agains 3 rapists who outweigh her by 100 plus pounds.  But does anyone honestly think that will be effective?  The firearm is the great equalizer.  It doesnt matter if you are weaker, if you are in a wheelchair, if you are outnumbered, a firearm evens the odds and is the BEST deterrent for criminals.  NO one wants to get shot so a woman with a Glock 26 is a whole lot harder to over power than one with a stick.  An airsoft gun?  This is spoken like someone who has never been in a fight and refuses to realize the reality of the situation.  If airsoft was an effective criminal stopper why aren't police officers issued them?  Its because they shoot plastic balls that don't even break the skin.  That is going to be a deterrent to a rapist? A home invader? A mugger?  If you want to deter criminals, murderers and offenders on all kinds of drugs with a plastic ball be my guest but don't tell others who live in reality to do the same.  This is the 21st century.  We can't all walk around with a middle age shield slung over our back and we surely can't be irrational enough to tell an 80 year old woman in a wheelchair to use a box of ring pops to stop home invaders."
"879","Isn't there any other logical defense other than guns? In fact, there are. One solution, evacuating as quick as possible, another is to use anything around you in battle or defense. You can make almost anything a weapon, or sheild. You might even be able to defend yourself with a kitchen knife, or slingshot, or even tons of boxes of ring pops. But you come here and say, GUNS ARE OUR ONLY DEFENSE MECHANAISM, WE NED DEM. No, you don't. You can actually even use a real SHEILD to defend. Or an airsoft gun. Americans rely on guns too much, for both defense and attack, but mostly attack."
"880","+kevin hazrati Just because they don't follow it doesnt mean it should be scrapped along with everything else that we hold dear.  Instead of throwing our hands up, it would be more effective to fight in the courts and bring justice along with holding government responsible for their actions.  Letting them write a new constitution to fit their needs would be the opposite of preserving citizens rights.  "

"886","banning of arms only disarms the innocent.
Those willing to inflict harm will always find a way"
"887","+Spartan Very true that is another angle to consider when talking about gun control.  We have been going after the OBJECT of crime for years and it always ends the same.  MASSIVE amounts of money, RAMPANT personal invasion, and MINIMAL impact.  The prohibition for example.  The government spent millions which in that time was a lot more cash, to get alcohol off the streets and it only resulted in funding the largest crime syndicate that the world has ever known, The italian mob, by making sure they  had a product that no one could obtain anywhere else with ease.  It created a whole new class of criminal and raising the prison population ten fold all for what?  Some sense of moral justice that we are stopping people from abusing alcohol? No.  The laws passed for the purpose of alcohol abuse prevention were the only thing that CAUSED people to abuse alcohol.  The only people that would risk getting alcohol were addicts and criminals that could care less if the law found them out.

 Then we tried the same thing with the ban on marijuana.  Now you would be hard pressed to be at a college campus in the US where it takes you over 10 minutes to find someone who can provide some form of the drug.  Banning things don't work, it only makes the people with that product more powerful because now they control the entire market and can regulate flow into the market controlling demand.  You want to make the cartels even more powerful? Then go ahead and ban guns because there are three things that they have a lot of, MONEY, DRUGS, and GUNS.  And if you make their guns a lucrative product for the criminals and citizenry here in the US their influence will only grow. "
"888","+Ruby Jones If we had gun control then only criminals will have guns and us law abiding won't be able to defend our selves. We banned weed yet I can still get it pretty easily."
"889","+Ruby Jones Yes no one here is trying to argue that it is just as effective to use a knife to kill people as it is a gun, the argument is if legislation will actually make any difference from the wrong people obtaining guns or doing evil things period.  The fact is that there is no guarantee that there will be any reduction in murder if legislation is passed to control or ban guns because the people that use them for wrong are already circumventing the established laws to commit the crimes.  Essentially, it would be equivalent to passing laws restricting the sale of alcohol to a certain distance away from roads to prevent drunk driving.  This would just inconvenience everyone and the people that are alcoholics or poor decision makers would still be driving drunk and you would just hurt the law abiding population.  

To look at the actual statistics of the matter, one begins to notice a very odd paradigm in the ""effectiveness"" of governments with gun control.  Take this example:  A new weight loss pill is created and it is reported that an actor with a great body used that pill.  One the surface everyone would say "" wow this pill really must work look at his/her body""  When in reality, the pill would only be a success if it was proven that there was a significant change after the pill was administered AND if it was the only variable that was changed in the persons behavior.  In the case of gun control, you find that nearly ALL major industrialized countries that are set up as examples of gun control success fall into this false sense of success.  The UK for example NEVER had the murder rate that the US has currently and actually prior to mass gun control legislation had a lower murder rate per 100,000 than they boast now post gun ban. 

The end result is that gun control would be a major expenditure financially.  A huge venture in invasive government action into the citizenries lives.  And a violation of freedom all for no guarantee of any change what so ever."

"900","+Owem Gee Thing is, if guns weren't necessary to protect ourselves, than it still wouldn't be a problem to own them because no one would be attacking each other.  I would support gun ownership no matter if the criminal was armed or not.  The citizen deserves to be better armed than his or her attacker no matter what the criminal has at their disposal.  "

"903","Implying taking away guns will stop criminals from illegally obtaining guns to commit crimes. I could literally make 3 phone calls and have an illegal gun in my possession within a few hours.
In Switzerland, the vast majority of men between the ages of 20 and 30 are conscripted into the militia and undergo military training, including weapons training. The personal weapons of the militia are kept at home as part of the military obligations; Switzerland thus has one of the highest militia gun ownership rates in the world. Switzerland also has the lowest crime rates than any other country in the world.

Think of it like this. If a criminal knows that most people around his neighborhood carry some sort of firearm, the chances of him/her deciding to commit a crime would be less. This knowledge would instill fear into criminals.
Guns are for the people man. You really think the police and military should be the only ones to carry guns? Talk about police state."

"924","+Colin Pitts a different culture indeed, I must say! I'd go with the UK culture..."
"925","+Javontae Eaddy Its a different culture in the UK and cannot be compared to the US so lets rule that out.  Secondly we have to look at how small a percentage of deaths mass shootings actually account for because legislating on such a small and sporadic incident would be like banning islam because of one extremist or banning alcohol because of a couple of drunk driving incidents."

"936","+Alexander George Is that the same UK that lets Muslim extremists walk all over it?

Of course it is.

Of course it is... "
"937","+Colin Pitts well ""banning"" would be a solution...but these gun slinging murikkkan idiots won't have any of that..."
"938","+ellisg95 Well if you are not coming after the guns you want them to be legal then we are right back to where the US is now.  People buy guns because they want them and they are all legal now and following background checks.  If people will find a way around security what makes you think that these same people won't find a way around any new gun legislation?

Now i know you didn't implicitly say that you were hoping for an all out ban on guns but you did mention that the US should adopt laws like the UK which in all intents and purposes makes owning a firearm as a private citizen nearly impossible.  

The measures that i was referring to would be have the schools have some form of armed security.  It could be as little as two or three police officers.  They already have this implemented in many areas around the US and it has been rather effective in the areas that it has been used.  They are personable and its not invasive to the children just another adult around that is looking out for their safety. 

Lastly, if you don't propose the ban of guns, or the increase of security, then we are left with a worst case scenario where you discourage the ownership of firearms but who is going to listen to the discouragement? the sociopath? the gang member? these are the people that aren't going to pay attention to society telling them not to get a gun and these are the same people that currently don't follow the law no matter what it is."
"939","+Colin Pitts First of all, when did I say you needed to get rid of all 350 million of your firearms? You keep saying that I want all of these guns gone but I don't, I never said I did, I never said I wanted them outlawed completely. If someone wants to own a gun I believe that the person should have the right to buy one, providing it's all legal.

What I'm saying is people should be deterred from buying guns in the first place. Or maybe not deterred but certainly not encouraged that guns are necessary to help protect you. I look at guns in a similar way to smoking, if you want to smoke that's fine, it's your own, personal choice, just don't force me to breathe it in with you.

Every single country has it's share of rapists, murderers, psychopaths, etc, the list of scum goes on. However in the US there is a higher number of gun crimes than nearly everywhere else, why? It's because people in the US like their guns, now I know if people are murdered it doesn't matter whether they were shot or stabbed, the end is result is that they're dead. However if someone uses a gun they could potentially kill a far greater number in a shorter space of time than the other psycho wielding a knife. 

Also I don't think you should blame the institutions because they don't have the measures against people with guns. At the end of the day, it's a school, as you said earlier; gun crimes are rare, how likely is it that someone is going to walk into a school and try to kill people? Also what measures are we taking? Are the pupils and teachers being searched and going through detectors, or do you simply need authority to enter the gates into grounds of the school? If you can put an ID badge onto a little sensor that could work because it stops people without one getting in the grounds and it also  wouldn't give off the impression that you're at risk of being attacked all the time.

I agree that the mad men pulling the trigger are to blame. However, there is trouble with using more security and that is that it's not preventing the cause of the of the problem, which is too many dangerous people with guns, it's just treating the symptoms, which is the dangerous men using the guns. As I said earlier; you can't have security on every street, you also can't arm people because gun crime would go up, the examples I used earlier were exaggerations but someone was stabbed for a copy of GTA 5 for crying out loud, you can't honestly believe that if everyone is armed with guns that crime levels will stay the same or that there won't be an increase in shootings?  Also people will find ways around security or just will go in places with less security. 

I'm just saying that if people aren't encouraged to love guns the level of mass shootings decreases, yes there is nothing to stop that psychopath killing people but if they haven't got a love for guns or a big plan to kill as many people as possible in a short amount of time, there may be a lot less casualties if someone just decides to randomly start killing people one day.

According to whom? From what source did you acquire that information?"
"1052","+Jjb Johnson  You would be if you support legislation that would restrict the availability of firearms in a manner that would in effect, tell people how to go about their lives.  The columbine shooting was an atrocity that should be blamed on none other than those that commit the crime.  For whatever reason, people are obsessed with trying to find causality in a situation and can't seem to divorce themselves from emotion when deciding policy.  The horrible truth is that when someone does something like this, there is nothing to blame but the people themselves.  We don't blame the DMV or car manufacturers when there is a huge accident that claims lives, we don't blame pool builders with the drowning of hundreds every year and we don't blame the loss of life to suicide on the specific objects that were used.  Yet with shootings, it is the one single crime where common sense goes out the window and everyone wants to blame the tool not the person.  People do things that we cannot possibly understand as sane individuals it is our job to live and let live but at the same time make sure our priorities are straight.  We have armed guards in every jewelry store, bank, and major fortune 500 company.  Why is it that the most precious thing of all, our children, are not afforded the same protection as our money and valuables?"

"1056","+Colin Pitts The same as im allowed to say what i think about guns being available to pretty much anyone"
"1057","+snois2
I didn't say that, I said considering it's all one country which unless they're on parole can pass through at will (although considering we're talking about psychopaths, I doubt they care about breaking parole), they can get guns whether or not guns are banned in their area."
"1058","How about your gov't tries to solve the complex issues of gun violence (actually should say violent crimes in general) instead of simply trying to take away the tool.

Violent crime such as the ones shown in the video above are generally caused by one or more of these factors:

-poverty of an area (the higher the poverty, the more likely someone is to use crime to supplement their wealth, be it with a gun or not)

-how well that country treats the mentally ill (many of the shooters in the video are known to have suffered mental illnesses, and those illnesses likely were a significant factor of their crimes)

- how well a government targets *illegal gun* purchases (stats show that most crimes committed are not done by people who legally purchased their firearms, but purchased them from gangs and off the street so they are harder to trace. This is not saying that some crimes aren't committed with legally acquired guns, but the vast majority are not. It would be asinine to ban fire arms from law abiding citizens as a result of a few out lying cases)."

With your logic, even saying the name of a killer, let's use Hitler, for example, is glamorizing him. "

"1066","Not guns, the madmen who get their hands on these guns. I'm not the biggest gun advocate but I stand by the constitution.

"1075","Sorry to hear that Travis.  But isn't it amazing how you can watch something and relate to it and think ""ahhh, so there are others out there with the same exact view on things that I have.""   Can't imagine what that must have been like for you with being forced out and home schooled just because someone ""said"" blah blah and poof there you are.  Since Columbine  In general as I'm sure you've always known, people believe that media = truth.  People cannot distinguish truth from what news media does to get ratings.  Columbine was a horrible thing.  But because of people's dumbfoundedness, at least here in America it has caused students to get suspended for the stupidest things, for example, nose rings, challenging someone to a fight, talking back to a teacher (which I witnessed a thousand times as a kid...way before 9/11, Columbine etc.)  I got bullied and the crap kicked out of me several times...but nobody did anything about it and I never pulled a Columbine on anyone...I took it and went off to college and overcame it.  It seems that people have lost their balls today. "
"1076","Exactly. I actually got suspended for half a year and forced into a home schooling system because some little tit from one of my classes said I had a hit list and was going to kill a bunch of people with ""a big ass truck."" Of course this was right after the Columbine BS, so they jumped right on the opportunity to get rid of me. Shortly after that, I heard about Bowling for Columbine and watched it at the first opportunity I got. I was greatly impressed."
"1077","You should see Bowling for Columbine.  It puts the entire US system of fear and how Americans react to media and how we're supposed to be as a society on trial.  There's a part where Mike Moore and a friend take a friendly walk thorugh Compton, CA right through the heart of what we all think is the danger zone.  It's quite eye opening having never been to places...you don't know shit about what happens there...the news is your only source and even they don't know what happens. The news that is.  And don't even get me started on the gun stuff.  Give it a watch...it's got the MIke Mooreisms in it but there are some glaring facts and Marilyn Manson happens to be a smart guy even without this film."

"1087","+dan grout Sorry but these conversations really make Brits look dumb, because they have no idea what they're talking about. If America had no guns, thousands more would harmed than saved. Think about it, if someone uses a gun to prevent a home invasion, the gun saves them it doesn't hurt them. But if they don't have that gun in their home, the invader wont hesitate to steal from that home. Look at Washington DC for Christ's sake! That place banned guns, look what they have going' for 'em. I doubt you'd even bother to look at the statistics, but guess what, every city in the US that ranks most in murders by gun imposes gun control. Conclusion: criminals don't give a damn about gun control, they'll still find a way to get a gun or something else to their advantage. A kid in Pennsylvania just stabbed 20 people in his high school with a knife. Several are dead or in fatal condition. If the same happened with a gun, idiots like you would be screaming ""gun control"", well what about knife control?"
"1088","+Angelina Hernandez so going on a murderous rampage is not as bad if you have been bullied? Is that what your saying, please correct me if I'm wrong. But if America had no guns non of those people would have been killed, bullying or not. So instead of just remembering the fallen don't insult them as well by not changing the laws that killed then. "
"1089","+sean paul America may have it's problems but so does every other country. Also America isn't a terrorist, people are and it so happens that the whole world is full of people. People decide whether to be good or bad (unless they have mental issues). Like it is said, all monsters are human.
Also I think the people on here are hypocrites. Some of those shooting were because of bashing and bullying. So how about we all become mature here and stop calling each other idiotic and terrorist and just remember those who have fallen."
"1090","+Emile Heskey Oh what happened baby?? R u that dumb not to see that the only fucking idiot here is you?? You fucking close minded fuck. Geez! Now I know why everybody makes fun of americans and their fucking ignorance."
"1091","ya but u dont see people killing random people or school shootings. IN mexico bad people only kill people that are in that business( which if they want to kill each other is fine by me) and there only bad people have guns. Im not saying that crime would magically dissapear but im saying that it would help. And did you know that 90% of all the guns in mexico and latin american come from the US now thats a fun fact."
"1092","those articles are written by gun fanatics who want to protect guns. Lets look at data written by a neutral side and it tells that less guns=less crime, is a fact. If people want to hunt then they can borrow a gun from a  customer center or something like that. How is it that there are more shootings in chicago than in Irak well more guns!"
"1093","+Cheese Luver I dont see it as mentally scaring kids but as a message saying ""This is what happens if you do shit like that"" The 2nd amendment needs to be banned there is seriously no point in having a gun, we are not in the old west anymore. There will always be more crime if guns are legal is a fact you cannot change that. And if gun-owners get angry well fuck them! the government works for the best of the country not for the people having guns. "

"1108","+George Prowse You are the close minded fool you ignorant buffoon. The constitution allows freedom of speech, the right to privacy upon many others. If you don't understand it, don't generalize it just because you are afraid of guns. There's a reason why we left Britain. "
"1109","+AlexS71192 The Constitution is a load of crap. Get over it. Why do you treat it like it's so special? If you care more about guns than the safety of future generations then you are a closed-minded fool."
"1110","+spitxfire99 Deadly serious. Stick a hundred thousand more police on the street and get the guns out of the system. As I said before it'll take a decade but it will be worth it. Your kids will thank you for it."
"1111","+George Prowse Really? Is this some sort of sick twisted satire, or are you serious? If you are serious, I just... I can't do this anymore."
"1112","I don't think it would. It would just take swift and albeit, severe action to implement it in the best way possible"
"1113","I said it would be difficult, and it would be expensive. But it could be done, and the country would be better off for it. Gun crime is pretty damn high in America, and the amount of lives lost because of it seems unfair"
"1114","Do you understand how many people die because of guns. And it's not like me stating ban all the knives to stop knife attacks. Guns are different. They can cause a hell of a lot more damage, and without them, none of incidents that are in the video would have occurred. And the 'good' of them with people wanting to shoot idk, tin cans off a roof, doesn't really weigh up to the bad side in which people die. Getting rid of guns would be hard, and I understand that. But it could work  "
"1115","+Emile Heskey I really can't tell if you're trolling or just being an idiot. And, mental illness affects so many people (more people have it then don't have it at some point in their life), so that kind of just kills your point. And I'm not saying how this should be done, I'm not your fucking president, I'm just saying what should be done. I'd much rather have someone come at me with a knife than a gun, but I can tell that you're one of these 'gun loving' types and are probably too hyped up to see how dumb your ideology is. Maybe you should see what it's like to get shot and then come back with a comment that possibly has some rationality to it"
"1116","the reason why Britain doesn't have these problems is because Britain DOESN'T LET YOU CASUALLY OWN A GUN! 
Is it really that hard?
**Really?**
And, in % terms, it still doesn't have these problems. So, maybe you should be gettin rid of those guns. 
And, btw the way, this 'shitty' country is where most American's originated from . . . so . . . you know . . . a bit awkward . . . "

"1119","+Tommy gun Its great that you don't believe in the banning of all guns and recognize that they can be used for good.  No one here is advocating the misuse of these guns as you have mentioned.  Certainly those instances should be avoided the real question is how to do so and thats where the firearms owning community and yourself fall on different ground.  Provisions are being proposed that would do nothing to curb the misuse of firearms and only affect those that already use them responsibly.  Its like making it more difficult for good people to drive their cars because a minority drive them drunk.  You would be going after the wrong people and people would still drive drunk no matter what tests you put in place before owning a car, no matter what psych evaluations you mandate, people are going to make poor decisions.  Its our job to minimize these instances by educating the youth about drinking and firearms so that they aren't the ones that make these decisions but mandating some overarching provision is just going to make things far more expensive and personally invasive for those that follow the law.  When a viable solution becomes available then a conversation can be had but until that point, we need to secure schools and make sure that people are able to defend themselves adequately. "

I don't condone what the shooters did their , But I COMPLETLY understand what they went through while living their in that type of community, and going to these types of schools. 

It probably started since Jr. High for them as it did me, and I wouldn't be surprised if they went to KEN CARL Jr. high either.

You're correct....too many mentally-fucked kids in your problematic nation who're on medication.

You shd be familiar with this formula."
"1144","Most of these shooters are insane and could have gotten help. They deserve to rot in hell I agree with that. But maybe we should try and help these people to prevent this. Also giving military weapons to civilians doesn't help. We don't need AR-15's with 100 round magazines those weapons aren't made for hunting they are made to kill as many people as possible. We should ban assault weapons and limit magazine capacity to 10 rounds per magazine. That isn't breaching the second amendment it is saving lives."

As far as 'wondering why the world hates the US so much', I could give a shit. Do you care if the US hates you? I didn't think so, so can the narcissistic assumption that we in the US give a rats ass about your opinion. I'll pose a question to you in response: Why do you think your governments work so hard to keep all the firepower in the hands of those in power? Are you really that naive to think that's it in your 'best interest' to be legally forced to give up your arms? If your govt was there to serve you why would they need to disarm you?  Good luck answering that one all you loyal ""SUBJECTS"". A herd of cattle puts up more fight than that."

Its violent entertainment. REAL murder and killing is sad and shows how pathetic a person is. Mental illness or not. America should have the death penalty for murderers.

If you think such is the case and are grateful for it know that the walls of such a prison do not fully contain the suffering incurred by its denizens (like someone leaving prison in worse shape than they entered intent on wreaking retribution upon the free world...). If you counter with, ""more life sentences""...project that proposition 50 years down the line and write me how their sorrow and anger (in all forms toward all things) could possibly be separated from our joy and excitement. 4: I fully agree that if the death penalty is to be taken seriously than we ought to dispense with half-measures and just get right down to business...the gun is in the mail k?...but seriously that's the beginning and end of the problem...let one who is without sin cast the blah blah blah...I suppose logically the victims' families should have first dibs.... My point (I put this at the end because I would have lost anyone had it been the first thing to read) is that the vile, disgusting, bile-spewing, soulless (whatever that means) sack of sentient meat (yes, I saw the season finale of True detective...) that committed those murders connected (in the absolute BROADEST sense of the word) with those children and their families in an appalling and horrific (though not the worst if you think about it, then keep thinking till you agree...) way. The ONLY F*&^KING WAY to have any hope of making it off this earth (screw climate change, I'm looking at the sun and time is running out...or building up if you like Saturn...) is dealing with everything that happened in the murderers life up until he committed to shooting up a school full of 7-8 year olds...whew...done...any thoughts or should I just go fuck myself?     "
"1251","I don't believe on the death penalty, simply because its the easy way out.  They should be forced to mandatory labor, just like everyone in prison.  Also, instead of killing them, I'm sure we could use human test subject for certain experiments, you don't think?  We can't bring back the lives that they took, but maybe we can use the killer's own lives to save millions in the future-- AIDS research, cancer, etc.  Call it morally inhumane, but once you take an innocent human life you loose part of your own humanity.  It is also morally inhumane that the taxes of the same families that lost a close one are paying for the offenders room and food at the federal prisons, It is just a thought."

No, someone who shoots up a school full of 7 and 8 year olds deserves to be shot in the back of the head in front of their family.

"1278","I wouldn't say ""popular"" is the right word, but the reason it is so infamous is because around 3,000 people died, national security was increased substantially, and it incited a 10 year war. Slavery and hunger have been and will almost certainly continue to be major issues, but they aren't specific events and they are often too far away physically for it to always be at the front of people's mind, but that doesn't mean no one is doing anything about it. The purpose of this comment was to inform, not to attack, by the way, but be forewarned that the nature of your comment (spelling, grammar, apparent message, etc.) will likely cause others to attack it (and to be honest that would not be completely unwarranted)."

That kid was also mentally I'll and on anti-depressant drugs and those two things don't mix, anti-depressant drugs have side-effects such as thoughts of suicide and homicidal tendencies and mix that with someone that is mentally ill, improperly secured firearm and that is a mass shooting waiting to happen. FYI the gun wasn't even an assault rifle and the semi-automatic rifle was found in the trunk of his car and only handguns were used but how he carried so many bullets and magazines is a mystery and something isn't right since the school was demolished and all evidence of the shooting was destroyed"

"1284","+JK Low You don't see the inherent problem with what you suppose?  You would need a mass list or gun registry to make sure that you knew which individuals owned guns before enacting all the things that you propose which the US doesn't have.  Before you simply say, "" Just institute a full registry"" let me explain the difficulties.  You would need the consent of 170 million gun owners which in the US won't give you that consent.  Giving the government information on who ownes guns is one step removed from losing privileges to those guns.  You would also need to violate the fourth amendment to unreasonable searches and seizures to check EVERY SINGLE HOUSE in the US for guns.  That number is staggering, you would have no idea where to start so you would simply have to trample over everyones rights.  And after all this oppression and privacy being ruined, the criminals that use guns in crime are still going to have them and the poor deranged man is still going to do horrendous things.  You cannot legislate against humanity, insanity, or motivation.  Those who would do evil will still do evil and those who are good will still be good regardless of your increased background checks.  All that it would accomplish is the destruction of two constitutional amendments, the loss of billions to fund ridiculous house searches, and no change in violence and most likely an increase in violence to force searches on those that would not consent to them."

Your ""background checks"" are only valid at a SINGLE point of time. 
Today, I might pass the bg check and buy myself loads of assault style weapons, ammo and even body armour.  
6months later, I lose my job, owes the bank loads of money, declared bankrupt, my family crumbles and my wife runs away with a rich Nigger. 
THAT'S THE TIME when a responsible, friendly, non-criminal American start going berserk and start grabbing his guns. Look at the historical case where such a useless numbnut grabbed his gun, barged into a beauty salon and shot his wife, proprietor and customers. 

To be effective, each legal gunowner musty be evaluated every 6mths on his occupatonal status and type, financial stability/situation and mental health.
If he/she fails it, all the guns should be temporarily confiscated until he/she can pass the evaluation in the future. 

Poverty + Financial Insecurity + Misery + GUNS = Classic American Chaos."
"1286","+Colin Pitts
thank you for your reply :) and I am assuming you mean 98% that are not 'justified' by the police :) as 1/3 of all murders in the US are committed by our very own pope and only about 1/2 are actually justifiable...
And I dont seem to see anyone crying for bans on pressure cookers... or black powder... etc etc.... hahah :)"
"1287","+Mike B First off they do go through background checks.  The fact that you don't know that shows your prowess on the subject at hand and invalidates any of your statements.  These are relatively isolated incidents the same as extremist religious terrorists taking lives yet we don't call for the abolishment of certain religions or the right to religious freedom in the first amendment.  If you were to take a little time and research were the most murders happen and under what pretenses you would come across the unequivocal reality that 98% of murders are in the streets by criminals with illegal weapons.  These incidents get sensationalized by media because it helps push an agenda and calls people to arms easier then using gang violence in inner cities. "
"1288","+anjhindul   i'd like to see any of these ccw dorks in a situation where someone in a dark room is unloading hundreds of rounds onto people.  they'd shit their pants and freeze up.  owning a gun is nothing but a dick measuring contest for the dickless anymore.  if we didn't have shops selling armored vests, tactical vests, 100rd drums, bushmasters, and gasmasks and actually go thru background checks, these problems would be cut in half"

Do you really believe that if a good person had a gun in those situations they would be more likely to kill civilians, if they attempt to take out the threat? I cannot fathom that people would rather be completely defenseless and run/hide rather than take the chance of shooting back. These things will always happen, they happen even in countries that prohibit gun ownership. We all need to realize that there are bad people and we need to take the necessary steps to protect ourselves when we find ourselves in these situations. The only people that support gun control are tyrants and the ignorant. And it is ok if you fall under the latter, just please research and educate yourself outside of MSNBC, or any mainstream media for that matter."

Do you deny the fact that if a LAW ABIDING citizen with a gun was in any of these places at the time of the shooting could have stopped these psycho's? Just because there are crimes committed does not mean you should take it out on law abiding citizens. Someone drinks and drives and kills multiple people, how come we don't ban alcohol? If someone stabs someone, how come we don't ban knives? I'll tell you why. Because the government is not trying to push GUN control on us, they're trying to have PEOPLE control. Because they KNOW, if citizens have guns, they can't do anything against us. But if they take our guns, we are defenseless and they have free reign over the country. Hitler? Stalin? They took guns and they slaughtered people. And when they killed people, it was incomparable to these ""mass shootings"". Not a single one of these instances in the videos was ANYWHERE near as terrible as what they did. And let me tell you something, HISTORY DOES REPEAT ITSELF. If we let the government take our guns, there will be unimaginable loss of life in our country. And if they do try to take our guns, people WILL revolt against, and there will again, be unimaginable amounts of deaths. We the people, the TRUE patriots, understand our GOD GIVEN RIGHTS, and we will not let the government decide what we can and cant own. We will not let them decide what we can and can't do, or what we can and can't eat. WAKE UP. A revolution is coming, and I promise you it will be uglier than the one in 1765. Just because the Bill of Rights was written over 200 years ago, it STILL applies today whether you believe it or not. That goes for the second amendment also. The second amendment was not written for hunting, or sports. And it was not about muskets. It was written to keep the U.S. government from becoming and TYRANNICAL government. If you support ban's of any types of weapons or bans of any weapons features, you are supporting the downfall of America. Doesn't ""shall not be infringed"" mean anything to any of you? If you support this BULLSHIT government we have, I will happily help you pack your bags and help you find a nice home in a country where you have no freedoms. If that's what you want, of course. Because no guns means no freedoms. There's no two ways around it. Period.  "
"1337","This video should be based on death counts but instead the content creator puts a strange value on certain people's lives. For instance #10 has 11 deaths  while #9 has 6 deaths but because some of the victims were political players they are deemed as somehow more valuable than others.

It is complete bullshit. Noone or at least very little people wanna outlaw guns. They are advocates of gun CONTROL, not gun BANNING"
"1359","Let's get one thing clear right now about these mass shootings: THERE IS NO CONSISTENT PATTERN OF WHY THEY OCCUR! The only similarty they share is that they're all committed by males. That's it.

Too often, we want to portray every single shooter as some messed up, bullied, sociopathic loner, and we want to believe this so much that we convince ourselves to do so. But it doesn't take much to realize that's not the case with many of these shooters. Case and point:

- The Columbine shooters weren't bullied. In fact, one of them bragged about bullying others himself. They weren't targeting anyone specific; their plans showed that they were after the whole school.
- The University of Texas shooter wasn't a sociopath who was ""pushed too far."" After he was shot, doctors discovered a coin-sized tumor in his brain growing on the portion that regulated his emotions (as the video mentioned).
- They're not all out for attention! The Virginia Tech shooter certainly was, but the Newtown shooter tried to cover every track (even deleting his entire hard drive).

So the next time a mass shooting occurs (and we know one will occur, because if there is no consistent pattern, there's absolutely no way we can prevent it), don't buy into any crap spewed about how whoever's guilty is/are just like the others before him."

+keveydaking All I'm saying is that if there were no guns at the white house, the president would have been shot dead a long time ago from a guy who bought his gun online (you can still do that regardless of the law) because of the lack of protection that the president would have.

You can preach your damn second amendment at me all you want but that doesn't change the fact that those laws were made hundreds of years ago in a world with a different culture and different technologies.

If people were not allowed to own a firearm in their home, then chances are they will not be able to defend that house against an armed burglar. If a criminal plans on robbing a bank, or a store with a gun, they'll probably get away until police arrive (Which isn't guaranteed that the police will be able to stop them). Reason for that is because people are not permitted to concealing a firearm in their business. It doesn't have to be real bullets, hell, shotguns can fire non-lethal beanbag rounds.Arming the businesses will slow down crime. Think about it. If a guy is pointing a gun at you and you're defenseless, you'll be sworn to do what he want's. But if you were to pull a bigger gun on him, there's a better chance that he will back off. Those new laws where maximum mag size is 10 isn't gonna slow them down. Especially if they have enough experience with firearms to reloading within seconds.

No they weren't, his real motive was the oldest one in the book: jealousy.

The only ""evidence"" proving that assertion comes from third hand accounts (a friend of a friend of a friend) which would be considered hearsay in court and the petulant whining of a spoiled psychopathic brat whose word shouldn't be taken seriously.

Psychopathy is not something that is created it is a personality trait that is present from birth and Eric Harris had all the classic symptoms of being a psychopath complete with an inability to care for others a narcissistic belief in his own ""brilliant intellect"" (his journals prove that he was actually rather room temperature IQ wise).

The ""victim"" fallacy is something that apologists like you created to justify the last act of a violently psychopathic mind that was incapable of feeling human emotion or dealing with rejection and demanded to be ""respected"" despite not deserving it.

In other words: If Eric Harris was mistreated in any way he entirely deserved it and most likely brought it on himself."

criminals are not stupid they do not want to bloody their hands (literately and figuratively) if they do not have to murder is still a big charge and they do not want to risk it in case they get caught those guns are really ment to scare you and/or control you (unless he is some of sort of psycho who broke in for the soul purpose to torture and kill you in which case you're really unlucky) in most cases they will only use the gun if you give them a reason to the last thing you want to do is appear as a threat and having a gun tends to be very threatening so you could let the gun man get his way and you will most likely come out of that with at least your life or you try your luck with challenging the gun man in an all or nothing scenario where you can either stop him or he could kill you so when you have a gun you actually increase the chance of someone getting killed (be it you or the perp) dramatically and all those statistics of people successfully fighting off a burglar using a gun doesn't erase all the statistics of people using house hold guns to commit mass murder now i have 1 more question for you is the tiny advantage you get by owning a gun against a criminal that may never strike (there are many gun owners who never get the chance to use there guns for what they claim they're for protection) really worth all the life loss they cause? "

Secondly, two of the three weapons you stated are illegal to even look at in the US, let alone allow a CHILD to take posession. And to top it all off, anything classified as a lethal weapon shouldn't be on ANY child on school property. While you're at it, you could say, ""Steven found out that Sam has a rocket launcher, so he gets a NUKE, and launches it 50 miles away from the city, JUST TO BE SAFE!"" Having a standard firearm in your house doesn't make you stupid, but the way you handle it is what would make you stupid. Ask anybody who owns guns, or knows someone who owns guns. 70% of them will probably say, ""Banning firearms is a dumb idea."" "
"1591","Example: A world were any weapons can be bought in society. Kid one brings a small handgun. The other kid scared say's mom, my friend Jimmy has a handgun can I have a machine gun..sure Michael. Then Adam who is scared say's to his mom, Jimmy has a handgun & Michael has a machine gun, can I have 3 machine guns..sure Michael. Another kid (Samuel) from another school is threatened by all the other kids weapon's..I know I will get a rocket launcher. Samuel has a bad day in school and blames it on Jimmy,Adam & Michael and any other kids around them. So lets use this rocket launcher kabooommmmm!!!!
Following week damn Samuel had a rocket launcher, I want a 10 handguns,10 machine guns, a few grenades..no one is going to mess with me."

 whilst that is a very valid point we are not talking about mexico here. In america they do not have a high rate of kidnap for cash. people do not need personal protection and in fact if they are allowed to carry in public the likelihood is the time they would need it most is when they have a gun pointed at them which is a bad time to try to pull your own weapon. in the uk we can own shotguns for hunting. if someone breaks in a shotgun is going to be either a good deterrent or a good tool for creating a new opening in someone. what a shotgun is not good for is massacres as its poor at distance has two shots and cant be reloaded quickly. anyone not feeling safe because they only have a shotgun has alot of issues. just ban everything but shotguns and incidents will fall through the floor and home owners will still be protected"
"1594","+needsmetal
I fully agree with that and believe if they didnt get fame there would not be so many however history is history and media is media thats not going to change. criminals are not usually the ones doing school shootings if guns were banned regular kids would not have access to them. it would take time but it is in fact the only solution unless you can think of another?"

Freedom, in the wrong hands, will breed LAZINESS, COMPLACENCY and arrogance.

A word of advice...FREEDOM is only for the highly-educated, already successful Americans who're 100% sane, 100% socially conscious, with zero criminal record, highly intellectual individuals who can behave themselves, who're already leading a great life. That jobless Nigger causing trouble on the streets shouldn't be given ""freedom"".

If guns wont be banned then have better backround checks, mental illness checks for EVERYONE who buys a gun and have to own a trigger lock and know how to use it. also if you have a family member or friend who lives with you and they have a any criminal record or a history of mental illness you should not be able to own a gun. also most guns that are used by mexican drug cartels come from the us. "

"1742","Then WHY do Americans need to own MORE than 1 firearm???....and WHY do they need to buy anything more than a handgun?????.....and WHY can they buy lots of mililary stuff via Internet and mail order???

In such a fucked-up, illogical society with nonsensical laws, the cops NEED very heavy firepower to deal with you gunloving motherfuckers."
"1743","+Mrbloodydischarge what do you suppose will happen during food shortages or say the electrical grid goes down for prolonged periods of time as in months or years?. Solar flare regularity measured by ice core samples indicate that every 75-100 years we get hit by one of these grid killing solar storms..were in the closing years of that events window 95-100 year span now. The last two were recorded in the 1850s and 1930s but had limited impact as our society wasn't dependent upon technology to survive. Millions could starve, die of disease, die from cold or heat or from lack of readily available prescription medication..what would you do to feed your self or your family?? The grid could be completely safeguarded and made immune to this potential for a mere 2 billion..However the energy companies decided that it was too costly and have left the grid open to disaster. Theres at least one reason why the police will have reason to..well you know."
"1744","+JK Low None of that is technically possible on a coup. Mini guns require a large vehicle to support its setup and its deployment and would only have two uses, escort of VIP or assault. Any squad automatic weapon can be mounted on trucks,jeeps and specially modified SUVs.."

Throughout history that has been shown.  Unfortunately it's something you have to deal with no matter what. "

"1755","+Meatieso García Srry I had no idea that time diminishes reason. Do you know how many people have died because of their governments in the last century alone? Approx. 270 million people. America is not like the french, I know little about French culture but here our government is heading the wrong way. Look into studies performed by Harvard, CDC, and Rudolph Joseph Rummel (a political scientist.)"
"1756","+mcsc177 Are you actually justifying the possesion of guns now with the reasons used three centuries ago? Really? ""Because we need guns in order to be citizens, no subjects of the Queen of England""? I remember that episode of The Simpsons, when Homer says this to Lisa. I thought that was a joke, and nobody really believes it. Australia, Canada... all those countries are sovereign by themselves, it is just reminiscence from the colonial past, like your rights of owning guns. I agree with you in the statment ""more poverty = more crime"", but it makes me think in U.S. healthcare and other topics, but this is not the place, we are talking about guns.

So, in you twisted mind, why do you think about French, for example? They are no subjects, they have no kings, they are citizens and they do not have guns. And it is a safe country too. Finally, I don't think that you, americans, are protected against goverment with your guns. I think you are tyrannized as well as the rest of the Western hemisphere is. No more, no less, we are citizens in both sides of the Atlantic.

Or why not start with your home? Maybe you should post a sign in front of your house that says ""Gun free home."" that will certainly inspire people you empty skull. "
"1759","+mcsc177 It is funny how everything you just mentioned is exactly the way the entire world thinks about Americans. Ruled by media and the government. What is funny is how you stated the media is influencing me and other persons? America is a country ruled  and completely and utterly controlled by media (eg the African killer bees, what a joke) the rest of the world knows this yet you are oblivious or ignorant to wish to see this. Guns are dangerous and should not be allowed to be held by the general public. More guns=less crime? Please what was this study based on? Absolute nonsense you think that just because Harvard does a study it is completely true? This is just another form of media controlling you and your ignorant thoughts. Gun control works the world over yet America still believes it is safest for everyone to carry guns."

"1762","+mcsc177 There is not ting unsual about black market. 
It exists in every nation. 
Example: 
In Thailand, there's also a black market for guns and ammo. 
You don't see Thai civilians rushing out to buy guns, shooting at beer cans with their own guns for fun, and you most certainly don't see Thais wearing body armor, military clothes and shooting their assault rifles inside a movie theater, university campuses and schools. 

Your Govt has ALLOWED the black market to flourish. 
The Govt has to keep the ""enthusiasm"" in firearms burning to fuel the demand for more new firearms. Just look at your gun mags...America has the highest number of gun mags on any shelf. The gun mags also help to drive the firearms market just like how car mags and forums drive the automobile market. 

In short, your US Govt is beyond corrupted, and doesn't give a damn about the middle class hardworking Americans. "

"1764","Using Goth culture and Manson as scapegoats for real problems seems to have become a tried and true method for not accepting responsibility.

It's so stupid."
"1765","Exactly as soon as we figure out the real reason as to why these kids did this then most of the people who said it was the Matrix, DOOM, Marlyn Manson, and Goths and shut up and blame what really caused it."
"1766","I do agree, I know a lot of Goths (some being my best friends) and they don't want to shoot up a place (unless it's paint ball or Airsoft) People need to CHECK they facts BEFORE making a statement or comment to help make reason of crime."

"1768","+Dragonlacross10 An actual fantastic response, appreciated. "
"1769","I agree that those who have mental problems SHOULD NOT have a weapon of any sort. Most of these shootings in schools is the result of mental problems. There some Americans (I will be included in about a month) who have taken courses to be responsible gun carrying citizens. If these mentally handicap people knew that the areas were not gun free zones it would decrease the amount of shooting dramatically. How often do you hear about somebody going into a gun shop to rob it? All these shootings happen in gun free zones. Gangbangers and Latino's go after each other's gangs, they do sometimes go on shooting rampages. But i do agree with you on the Mentally handicap people are not monitored enough, they should not have any type of access to weapons, but nowhere in the world will you find everybody completely responsible of their belongings, you will always have at least a small handfull."
"1770","+Squash Balls That's the problem. 
You don't know who actually has a gun, and WHAT that person is. 
I have never seen a financially-secure and highly successful banker or other millionaires go on a shooting spree wearing body armor, military webbing and toting lots of pistols and rifles. 

If you noticed, your psycho shooters are almost always NON-CRIMINALS...the typical Mr Joe living next door. That's the craxzy thing about the US. 

I have never heard of Nigger gangbangers and Latino gangsters rushing into a school compound wearing body armor and simply spraying 7.62s everywhere, specifically targetting kids.

Let's ban those too, huh? Lmao. Also, you can't prove easy gun availability is the core problem that sparks off ""all"" other subsequent problems. What are ""all other problems?"" And finally, who says we're ""renowned"" for these shootings. That's an assumption, not a fact.

Just because you cut off gun availability does not mean problems go away. Do you remember Prohibition? People believed taking away alcohol would solve problems, but in fact, it helped the Mafia become what it is today. In other words, if people want guns, they'll get them.

And studies have shown that crime has gone DOWN when more guns are bought for protection. It seems like you're talking out of your ass....or listening to those hypocritical anti-gun folks."
"1855","+Carl Waldron You can talk about the Constitution for the entire day and still, you can't hide the fact that the USA is globally renowned for the most sensational psycho random shootings at the most unexpected place.
And it doesn't just happen once every few years. LOL!. ...

Easy gun availability is the CORE problem that sparks off all other subsequent problems.  
 
Allow general violence to continue to spur the demand for personal protection, and hence, demand for guns. Simple tactic.  "
"1856","+JK Low And plus, the ability to buy guns is dependent on the state. All the Constitution does is protect people's right to have them. Here in Michigan, as long as you aren't a felon, you can buy a long gun off the rack and have as many as you want with as big an ammo capacity as possible. However in states like California, they have a cap on the mag size for ARs, and other long guns, which is 10 rounds. So, it's not the Constitution, it's the States that make the laws. There is a governmental principle that states that whatever isn't mentioned in the Constitution (i.e., Marriage equality) is left up to the states to decide."
"1857","+JK Low One, it's illegal anywhere in the States to take a gun into select places, bar included. As was clarified during Watergate, no one is above the law. However, a lot of cops have their own personal firearms that they use, which solves that problem.  Two, The Constitution sets the precedent of laws that states must follow. It bears many articles and amendments that are needed today, including the Bill of Rights, the right to vote for women, blacks, and 18-year-olds, thus if the Constitution is ""grossly outdated,"" then all those amendments and articles that make America America are not necessary, right? I mean, VCRs are outdated, so they aren't necessary to function in everyday life."
"1858","+Matthew Rodriguez You have a great point. 
Which boils down to the Constitution being grossly outdated, and totally irrelevant for today's modern society where almost anyone can go out to buy guns.  

If the Govt trusts even its own police with guns, why must cops return their guns when they end their daily shift? Why can't they just bring their guns along to the pub and then home? "

"1867","Okay, while the ATF and the Texas Rangers didn't handle this in the most proper of ways, they aren't solely to blame for the deaths. That's like accusing the state of California of killing all 900+ people at Jonestown. It's utterly ridiculous. Two, it's known that two of the three fires started too deep inside the complex for the ATF to get to. In other words, it's more than likely the fire that was started inside would've killed them anyway, even if they hadn't pumped the CS gas into the complex.

This is because most people who commit mass murder are insane and don't have the means to making their own gun. They just buy a gun from a store."
"1876","+Shane McAwesome You realize though that no matter what guns will never disappear. The fact that people can make them in their own homes now. Guns are their for protection of not only for yourself but for others. What if someone in the movie theater had their CCW? How fast it all could have ended.

There are weapons that you can protect yourself with besides guns, like knives, bats, things that can't kill 10 people in 4 seconds."
"1878","It's not the military, it's just some professor saying ""yeah Israel did it, of course they did it"" several times"
"1879","Wikipedia's article on the song doesn't mention the shootings.

"1880","+JakeNukem3D I wasn't that interested enough in your country. All I had to do was see your population to know why your ""gun control"" seemingly works. Here in U.S. it's much harder than that."
"1881","I bet this was the first time you actually saw where Finland is on the map when you opened your wikipedia page :) ."
"1882","+JakeNukem3D Finland. A country with a population of 5.4 million people. Get out of this thread and focus on Finland. Because you can't compare your country to ours. "
"1883","+mcsc177 Finland. And now you're going online looking up shooting incidents that happened in Finland to prove some point :) Trust me, you cant compare firearms violence between US and Finland."
"1884","+JakeNukem3D where do you live? "
"1885","yeah their all crazy im just going to sip tea "
"1886","You should see Somalia."
"1887","Welcome to the jungle."
"1888","
They need to add Sandy Hook to the list."
"1889","Yeah she was fine. Thank God. :)"
"1890","Sorry to hear that. Did she get out of the theatre   OK??"
"1891","you posted this video on my birthday  :("
"1892","Those McDonald Chicken McNuggets are very dangerous. Just look it up. All the fights that have broken out over nothing but some fucking pieces of deep fried  chicken. The McNuggets are a menace to American society and need to be banned ASAP!!!"
"1893","Conservative view: I want my guns for PROTECTION, the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a GOOD guy with a gun, i know MY RIGHTS
Liberal view: We just want less people to die by guns, the mass shootings in America are unacceptable, all we ask for are strict gun regulations like Canada, we just want to help people and keep them safe"
"1894","Yeah definitely. I don't buy the police stats either. "
"1895","+bonnyboy82 there might be more than that, they dont air everything on the news"
"1896","I didn't know it was that bad. My city of 4.5 million people has a homicide every few days and I thought that was bad. "
"1897","+bonnyboy82
The city of Los Angeles alone has around 6 million people,,,and combined with the massive amount of gang activity I wouldn't be surprised if the murder rate there was much higher than that. My daughter has lived in Los Angeles about 5 years so I'm a little bit familiar with the situation and it's not good."
"1898","Marilyn Manson was crucified over the Columbine shooting. The press acted like Manson personally went to those boys  homes and planned it with them."
"1899","+Sean Mounts I said the exact opposite you dumbass."
"1900","+Sean Mounts It's just that I find it ironic when Americans freak out about shootings when they happen everyday in other countries. They shouldn't just worry about shootings when it happen in their own countries, they should care when it happens anywhere, otherwise, it makes them look just ignorant. Besides aren't people supposed care about everyone and not just those who are close to them?"
"1901","Thats how terrorists are created."
"1902","Exactly the usa is great. The people who have never been and talk shit about it are stupid as hell."
"1903","+eric schlegel
It is very true about our shitty government. Just because they are placed in office doesn't mean they look out for our countries best interest. When people vote for politicians,, of course they tell tall tales about all the changes they'll make. If they really told their agenda no one would fucking vote for them.  Even though the U,S, is a violent nation with a very high crime rate,,and we have a shitty government,,and many flaws,,,There's no other place in the world that I would ever want to live than in the U.S.A."
"1904","+Nyne Lee Nah I was wrong...there is no real footage. But the footage from the movie zero day is appalling "
"1905","+collingoat
did you find the real footage"
"1906","+collingoat
Yeah, that's the fake one I was thinking of."
"1907","+mclarenf101 It's fake actually...from the movie Zero Day. My bad."
"1908","+mclarenf101 /watch?v=QIqaOAis7lA

Took me a couple days to decide to even search this up again...it's so fucking disgusting.

This one is not fake at all...comment back after you see this. My heart was pounding watching it."
"1909","They work in England..."
"1910","+JK Low Yeah, school shootings really happen because of lax firearm regulations. What an idiot. They happen because America doesn't have a proper system for dealing with the mentally unstable. Freedom isn't the issue here, it's lack of restrictions. I am a firm believer in personal liberties for everyone, but gun laws do need to be tighter. Those issues aren't even related in the slightest. What country are you from where you hate freedom so much? Freedom is something people intrinsically desire, I don't understand how you could hate something so good so much."
"1911","+T14JM
Are you blind?  Yes...freedom and rights is NOT for everyone. 
If you're a jobless, poorly educated nutbag with a poor future, WHY should you be accorded ""freedom"" and ""rights""???

You were born into a silly culture where these things have been blindly given away to each citizen. BUT...unfortunately, NOT every American is a highly educated, highly qualified intellectual who can behave himself till the day he dies. 

Look at the thousands of YT videos showing silly Americans using their firearms to shoot at beer cans, TV sets, refirgerators, watermelons etc. 
Awww...c'mon....pls don't use ""personal protection"" as an excuse. You guys are certainly gun-crazy fellas.

Look at the Aurora shooting. How on God's green Earth can a CIVILIAN buy body armour, military harness, armour-piercing 7.62 rounds and THOUSANDS of it?????  Since you're a classic stupid American, you'll also agree that a MOMMY who's a teacher also needs to keep a few assault style rifles at home for ""protection"". 

That's WHY your silly psycho shootings can never stop, and other countries are LAUGHING at you crazy numbnuts.

"1912","+ginojap My dear friend...why do you talk about Japan???????
67% of Americans in US don't even have valid passports (Dec 2013)!!!!!!!.....and even if they have, what is the % of Americans who have lived in other higher-quality nations for years?"
"1913","+JK Low Are you a fucking idiot? Freedom isn't for everyone? Are you telling me all humans don't deserve freedom? What an ignorant thing to say. The Prison Industrial Complex has nothing to do with freedom, it's actually the exact opposite. People are imprisoned so the rich can make money of them. Another ignorant statement. And prisoners and wardens become stars? What? No prisoner has become famous for being a prisoner that wasn't already famous. I really have nothing else to say to someone so obviously blinded by anger. You sound like a very angry person and it shows here. You come off as not only ignorant of everything that you spoke of, but an asshole who considers himself an intellectual. An intellectual who doesn't understand the concepts of freedom? Okay."
"1914","+T14JM
As an American born into a culture that loves talking about Freedom, you believe that Freedom is for everyone....and THAT'S where your problems begin. 

Freedom should never be blindly and unconditionally given to everyone. 
That's because no one can ever GUARANTEE the behaviour and conduct of everyone in that nation. 

Look at your silly convicts in your prisons. Due to your silly ""freedom"", your convicts appear to ""enjoy"" life inside the prison with proper food, clothes, can exercise to build their muscles and just treat your prison as another ""hood"" with different gangs existing inside. Example of freedom and rights blindly given to the wrong people. Hell...even your prisoners and wardens and guards can become movie stars on TV.

Hhahahahaa...what a silly nation.

Freedom, in the wrong hands, will breed LAZINESS, COMPLACENCY and arrogance. 

You guys love to fuck up Muslim nations, and due to your ""freedom"", you allow Muslims to roam wild and free within the USA. That's how your nation fucked itself. 

A word of advice...FREEDOM is only for the highly-educated, successful, 100% sane, 100% socially conscious, highly intellectual individuals who can behave themselves, who're already leading a great life in a high-quality nation.

In a nation where its gun-owning citizens upload THOUSANDS of YT videos showing them playing with their guns and shooting at beer cans, watermelons and refrigerators for FUN...OMG...these childish, low quality imbeciles must be very tightly monitored and controlled with minimum freedom.  That's how you got your High Incident Bandits (North Hollywood).....typical Americans with too much freedom, too much time, and able to purchase thousands of 7.62 AP ammo + body armour material without ANYONE ever knowing. 

Low-quality citizens in a low-quality nation drunk on the concept of ""freedom"". 
Hoi!...even your emails are being read by your NSA!!!!!  Hahahahaa....freedom my ass.
