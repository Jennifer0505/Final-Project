"1","You're honestly just as conniving and manipulative with an agenda than Mike himself, Sam."
"2","Let's not forget the cooling off period. Someone can get angry and in the heat of the moment they grab their gun and start shooting. If someone has to go home and make a bomb, chances are at some point they are going to start thinking about the consequences and perhaps not go ahead with it. Not in every case, but removing the immediate access to a weapon that can cause mass death allows for people to cool down and become more rational."
"3","I never understood the argument about needing gun to defend against the government.  Do you realistic believe that mere civilians with guns could really defends themselves from an invasion from the single most powerful army in the world? I have to say that you sir are greatly underesteemating our professional trained men and women thats currently serving in the army. By the way, how do you think our guns would fair against the drones, tanks, missle, and nuclear weapons (and god knows what else)?"
"4","also since you sound like a religious person from your post, I would like to ask you this question: If he was living on this earth today, do you think that Jesus Christ (the guy who preaches to turn the other cheeks and to love your enemy) would be pro gun, pro gun safety, or outright anti gun?"
"5","well guns are not allowed in Britain and their yearly gun-related deaths are only at 35, while in the U.S where owning a gun is allowed the number is in eleven thousands.  As you can see there's a big difference between 35 and 11,000 people dying yearly because of gun violence and as a Jesus Christ follower, I think every christian owes to themselves to fight to reduce gun violence and the uneccesary gun-related deaths that they causes."
"6","stricker GUN laws would make acess to guns harder , and would therefore make gun-related death harder."
"7","Australia banned guns and crime skyrocketed the next year. When you ban something, you simply create a criminal enterprise to supply law-breakers with that which is banned. Prohibition simply created Al Capone and bootleg criminal rackets. It was repealed, and you don't have alcohol kingpins today. Banning something is a proven way to nourish a criminal enterprise supply system."
"8","Did you honestly not know about this? Have you been living under a rock? "
"9","In canada?"
"10","kids were piled up according to one source? WTF? 1 MIN TEN IN...........LOL "
"11","Parents told them, ""If you are good, we'll get ice cream afterwards ... and candy ... and toys ... we'll go to unka Gene's and sit of the floor and pretend we are cub scouts and rehearse a play with Unka Gene"""
"12","He was not supposed to allow himself to be on camera."
"13","LOL, no, I didn't. thanks!
"
"14","6:21 Guy in white comes into the scene ALL SMILES, notices he's on camera and quickly backs out of the picture, followed by kid jumping up and down like crazy in front of the camera...."
"15","at 6:26
watch the people laughing in the background... yeah, I'm sure that a mass murder of children just happened right up the road from them..."
"16","the kid at 6:28 is proof that you just never know how people might react to severe trauma and grief."
"17","At 5:44 can anyone tell what the guy to the left of the guy being interviewed is muttering to himself?  He seems to be saying something about the guy that was ""walked out of the woods""."
"18","3:27 Blue sweater guy covering his mouth as he talks into his phone?"
"19","Somehow I missed this video from the beginning.  There's some different shots here, and I don't think any other station captured the Dad with his little pink-clad shooting witnesses.  "
"20","GAP product placement FAIL."
"21","good eye."
"22","It's a very suspicious ""scene"" in all of this."
"23","And, reportedly, only 1 girl survived from Rousseau's class, and neither of these girls are covered in blood, as THAT child reportedly was.  Aside from Hammond, there was another teacher shot in the ""extremeties"", supposedly a kindergarten teacher.  Reports of her shot while trying to hold the door shut?  Can anyone respond to that. In any case, I guess the alleged shooter did not enter the classroom.  A small town production of ""Annie"" could have produced better ""witnesses"" with more emotion."
"24","You're talking about the Dad and possible ""twins"" (who look a bit ""ethnic""?)?  So,  someone came into their room and shot a teacher.  Okay, first off, schools don't usually keep twins together in the same class.  And I don't recall ""twins"" in either Soto's or Rousseau's class.  According to the Newtown school district website, the elementary schools don't offer breakfast. Otherwise, I'd think that they had drugged the little suckers.  Speaking of dumbing down.  "
"25","10:45  short sleeved shirt in December?  I mean, seriously!  I speak for my parents and all CT taxpayers when I say that we don't want to pay for that friggin' blanket or whatever the EMS worker is putting around the tiny tot.  "
"26","I think it is entirely possible that a camera was setup, streaming live from that location, and the reporter and the father and daughters were in front of a green screen, it is technically possible and does not stretch the technical limits of modern, computer assisted green screen to any degree."
"27","We cannot tell where those tree shadows are coming from, if they are on an incline, or in a depression, etc ... I'm considering them, but we don't know the source and condition of those objects. What we do see without a doubt is the shadows in the middle of the road, these are clear and well defined and seem to be of substantial merit compared to other objects casting shadows which cannot be identified."
"28","Importantly, neither of these two young girls appear to be in either of the groups of children photographed by the Newtown Bee reporter in the Parking Lot of the Elementary School evacuating at 9:45am EST and 9:56am EST respectively."
"29","Yeah, this is nuts. Could be a total smoking gun, thanks for reviewing this."
"30","@05:14 Longitude =  41°25'24.66"" N Latitude =  73°16'36.89"" W : The house behind the ""father and daughters"", white picket fence, bush in the yard adjacent to the driveway, ""firehouse scene"" in the background down the road. We are east by northeast of the firehouse along Riverside Road. We see the adjacent driveways of the houses behind them, the mailbox, the dividing hedge. The shadows are nearly perfectly perpendicular to the ""Center Line"", slightly leaning east. 9:35am EST =/- 15 minutes."
"31","@04:01 we see THREE aerial vehicles in the sky, what appears to be TWO helicopters, and a much smaller vehicle, perhaps a drone."
"32","This clip begins, at 00:02, quite late in the day, shadows are very long and point strongly towards the northeast. The sun is bright and hot on the left, or southwest part of his head and face. It's near 2:30pm EST as the clip begins. And he says they have been there since 10:00am EST, and then corrects to 10:30am EST, both are crucial times here images and footage seem to be very, very rare."
"33","This was made a few days before the Sandy Hook shooting which would be at #1"
"34","That's funny, almost all of these mass shootings are taken place in a gun free zone! Hmmm....."
"35","only 10 common america , pretty sure your the best at school shootings"
"36","If only someone had a concealed 
"
"37","My sister was at the Dark Knight shooting. O_O"
"38","This was posted just nine days before the Newtown Shooting...."
"39","If this was after Sandy Hook, it probably would have been #1 or #2. For the Sandy Hook victims families, I'm still prayin for ya'll."
"40","""Top 10"" feels like an incredibly unfortunate title. haha"
"41","#5 yeah okay the ducking mcnuggets caused it : be
"
"42","My opinion: IF YOUR GOING TO DO A FUCKING MASSACREE WITH GUNS MAKE SURE YOU DONT SUICIDE AT THE END -_-"
"43","so scarey omg"
"44","just think... what if this video motivated the psychopathic killer of the sandy hook murders  to be at the top of one of these lists..."
"45","Listen people this list is not to being publicity to the shooters or their crimes. It is to remind and provide information to the masses about them. WatchMojo.com is not trying offend the family or the U.S. citizens with the video  "
"46","This is why you don't give people guns"
"47","And yet gun laws in the US are a joke! So sad..."
"48","I had a teacher 2 years back whose daughter was involved in the VA Tech shooting. It's truly a heartbreaking story. My condolences go to all."
"49","9 days later the Newtown Shooting happened which might have been the worst."
"50","marilyn manson , he has a good point"
"51","Come on now how ya'll gone blame chicken mac nuggets"
"52","Wow, this video was uploaded 9 days before Sandy Hook."
"53","OMG...  the fact that this top 10 list exists is tragic in itself.
How many mass shootings has this country had?  There's a top 10 list now?  the fack?"
"54","wait... no sandy hook?"
"55","doesnt really improve law enforcement times because it keeps happening in the US several times"
"56","The Columbine Massacre had me feeling upset because of the news and people blaming the Goth culture, for one thing, the Goth culture has nothing to do with harming anyone or anything because Goths dont associate with death with killing anyone as well, just cause we like scary things doesnt mean we want to go killing someone, we felt sorry over the cause of the massacre and when the discrimination came in, it broke me to see people blaming Goths. Goths have no association over violence, we're peaceful and most Goths care about their family, friends, and loved ones because Goths are still human, even when they have a liking to scary movies, or scary things, they still feel emotions, and still have remorse over the people they care about."
"57","Wounded knee"
"58","Stupid to blame Manson for the colombian shooting."
"59","Mustve been made before the elementary school shooting. THAT should've been number 1"
"60","Oh no poor Americans, one shooting and they all lose their shit but when there are 20 shootings in a day in other countries, they could not give the slightest shit. Pathetic."
"61","Funny thing is, a couple weeks after this video, 26 people were killed in a school shooting."
"62","What puzzles me is that the only shootings that start conspiracy theories are ones that are either the deadliest or the most covered. Guess these people are too stunned to really think rationally so they pretend the shootings never happened."
"63","even killing real people has now become an entertainment, and some fools think it's right to make a top10 out of it, as if it's an achievement.
""serves as a further reminder as to how unpredictable and horrible these tragedies can be.""
Yeah of course, this is sooo obvious...
Nothing but entertainment, if you ask me. You guys are fools, and you're not even aware of it. But eventually you'll realize it one day."
"64","America is the greatest country in the world!  Killing all those people before the cops show, GREATNESS!  Capitalist pigs deserve the psychos their culture encourages. "
"65","dude chill why would you do that"
"66","The Newton shooting where all those kids died u should be added but this clip was made before that."
"67","The U.S gov tried to change the right to hold a gun by providing a compulsory background check of future and current gun holders but nooooo... the american gun federations is too good for such a life saving reform =3= and so the reform was put into the reform graveyard "
"68","aurroa shotting  is a joke. people wants batman to save the world and magic happens a guy breaks in"
"69","god rest there souls who died in the list"
"70","it would be a shame if those Sandy Hook parents had forgotten to save their Christmas receipts."
"71","Gun control at it's finest."
"72","This video should not exist.  It will only tempt psychos to try and get on it instead of just killing themselves and being forgotten."
"73","I like violent video games and I will keep playing them but I really hope I stay in my right mind for as long as I live"
"74","wooow didnt expect that from marilyn mason, thats so true"
"75","American psichopats...I like it american kills americans :) good job"
"76","it's a sad day when you start ranking your shootings in a top 10 list"
"77","Three out the ten shootings took place in Texas.....hmmmmm."
"78","This vid must have been done before the Sandy Hook shooting because that one would probably be #1.  Sad but true."
"79","It's funny because they say that after virginia tech security increased in schools. How so because in my school if you walk into the school between the hours 7am-8:05 am where it is open to students to come in you don't check in at the front desk so anyone could easily get in without any problems"
"80","lol this video shows you something you'd never see today. A shooting VICTIM DEFENDING the 2nd Amendment."
"81","+TheMrSkelington090  you say the more people with guns will lead to less violence because.. for the majority.. these guns were bought illegally. I remember researching these events last year when they occurred and in reality the guns they had in possession were all legal bought guns either owned by their families or by themselves. So where exactly are you getting your information from??  

Look at Japan. Guns are not legal there by citizens and guess what there crime rate is unbelievably low.  Although that is also associated to their beautiful culture of honor and respect. "
"82","wow this was posted just days before the Sandy hook shooting"
"83","how come it's so easy for Americans to get guns?"
"84","WHY THE HECK IS THIS A WATCHMOJO LIST?!?!?!?!?!!"
"85","+Drew Blackburn I never said that taking away guns will solve anything. I said that the media has a huge impact on people. Not just the media but politics as well. The united states has gotten away with all these bombings and shooting on innocent people and it does affect the people back at home. Did you know that tge United states has one of the highest murder rates in the world? Why do u think that is? What we see on t.v. has a huge impact. Not on everyone but it does. & what I meant was that the second ammendment was instituted because of the British invading america my bad smart ass."
"86","In 1990, Julio Gonzalez killed 87 people in New York with a can of gas and a small flame."
"87","Guns were created to defend ourselves from the British that is where the second amendment came from....but years later do we really still have to defend ourselves against the british? That being said I'm not saying we don't have the right to own a gun but look at all the shit u see on tv. This person killed so and so and all you see on tv is violence and the need to have a gun increases. I bet that if the media decreased all of that, homicide rates.will go down. "
"88","That's a crazy country"
"89","Sandy hook.

R.I.P to all who lost their lives that day."
"90","the world is a dangerous place"
"91","God bless every person's family that lost there lives in these events and injured."
"92","I agree with what Marylyn Manson said no one listened to those kids
"
"93","Columbine security tapes are worse than you can imagine...especially the audio of taunting...uh one thing I wish I never watched."
"94","My condolences to the family's that have lost people in these shootings.
 "
"95","I swear, it seems like shootings are just a fad now. People are just sick. I just can't get over how evil and sinister people can be."
"96","this was 9 days before the biggest one..."
"97","I wish there was a device that could teleport police immediately during a crime"
"98","well wat are they going to do"
"99","deng it happend on a military fort wow"
"100","sandy hook hoax"
"101","no St Valentines Day Massacre?"
"102","Alright, to everyone that's raving on about gun control or expansion; ALL OF YOU, shut up and sit down. Arguing isn't going to help anything. The confiscation of public fire-arms isn't going to help, and neither is mass production and distribution. This is a problem whose cause has yet to be determined. Multiple fingers have been pointed at a varying degree of media advents, lifestyles and social pressures, but none of them have provided any truly tenable answers. And guess what? We're going to keep studying what we've got until we do. So, let's keep politics out of this, work on getting the solutions we need, and end the issues before they begin.

But wait, this is Youtube. The fuck's gonna listen to me?"
"103","shooter mostly go for GUN FREE ZONE because they know that no one there have a gun, that why I support CCW on school campus (:"
"104","schools always say safety is the number one on there list. yet anyone could put a loaded gun in there backpack and shoot because they don't even cheak"
"105","Their is one that just happened today. Sad but true"
"106","I think this should be a lesson to everyone we don't give guns to crazy motherfuckers"
"107","now I watch this video any since it on the fifth day of dec of last year(2012).and I got to say you guys need to do A freaking remake,for two reasons.one,is that after more mass shootings then these(like sandy hook or the washington DC shooting). two,is that you guys mess up these storys,well most.like not only marilyn manson or doom cause columbine,but even the freaking matrix and NO I don't care you guys said that  after this short flim was post on here.I don't.HELL,stuff like drugs or their life problems also are leding to the fucking massacre.and seung hui cho killed his ex-girlfriend before his deadly rampage.don't know why they forgot that.and they also forgot that james holmes boobly-trap his colorado home.WHAT THE HELL."
"108","did Marlyn Manson just school that guy?? wow"
"109","It's unfortunate that people can become so crazed and delusional, or just be so terrible and cowardly by nature."
"110","Nine days before Sandy Hook, eh?"
"111","Marlyn Manson is one the smartest people in the world."
"112","I wonder where sandy hook whorls be placed"
"113","Made in the USA"
"114","why is nobody understanding the anarchy and thinks that that is a riot or fights or wars or...?!?!? i mean WHAT THE FUCK people?"
"115","What about the kennedy assassination"
"116","sandy hook"
"117","I ranted on this video after the first time I saw it, and seeing it for the second is worse than seeing it the first time. Because knowing that shootings are probably happing all over the world right now as we speak!!! and yet, President Obama still won't get off his lazy ass, and say ""WE ARE BEING STUPID, AND PATHETIC  FOR NOT BANNING GUNS!!!! WE NEED TO GET OFF OUR LAZY ASSES, AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD PEOPLE, LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST!!! WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND WE ARE GOING TO BAN GUNS!!!!!"" that's what Obama should say. the Americans voted Obama to be president for a reason, then he should do his damn job!!!!! "
"118","Top 10 mass shootings! How do you rank these? Weapons used? Age of victims? Age of shooters? Public setting? You know you're glorifying these crimes right? ""Geez I want to make the news or a top ten! Shooting a lot of people is the easy way to do it!"" When are you making a top ten bombings list? Or a top ten serial killer list?"
"119","6:05 ""I wouldn't say a single word to them I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.""

If more people did that instead of just telling an adult, or the police, or some other authority figure, less school shootings would happen. I'm not saying NO school shootings would happen, but less of them would. When we live in a world where some of the greatest monsters haven't even graduated yet, we need more open ears than ever. More people need to understand that when a kid is in pain-when they're miserable, or angry, or both, they don't need to be talked to and told how to handle it all. They need to be listened to.

I was depressed and fatalistic in high school and though I didn't bring a weapon to school and go on a murder-suicide rampage, there was mindless violence and an instance where police and an ambulance had to come to my school and a student was wheeled out in critical condition. If more people listened to kids instead of talking to them more kids would be able to handle their pain. There would be less school shootings/attacks and there would be more kids going on feeling good about themselves and bettering themselves. They would better themselves because they would have the strength to.

There's a story around the web [http://www.snopes.com/glurge/kyle.asp] and though it may be fictional the possibility it speaks of is very real. Before you think of the outcast getting bullied and harassed and think ""If I befriend him it's social suicide"" remember that leaving him to suffer alone and in silence can mean suicide-or worse, mass murder-suicide, for him. A boy in China was threatening to jump off a pedestrian crossing was stopped by a girl who had never met him, but lied to police saying she was his girlfriend so she could speak to him and give him a kiss, after which he let police lift him back over.

Be the good in this world. Stop a minute and think of others, because a few minutes out of your day could mean the rest of someones life."
"120","What in the hell is wrong with people these days?!"
"121","Go read John Allen Muhammad (Beltway sniper) and its clear he was doing Allah's work. No doubt at all."
"122","Oh boy I wonder how many new and exciting mass shootings we can add to the list in 2014!"
"123","""Nothing like this has happened in Montgomery County""  - no shit i would think Snipers picking off citizens wouldnt be a common thing in Montgomery, TexaS ..."
"124","Kids wouldn't. Do this if there parents. Just listen. To them so. Just listen. Parents."
"125","Most mass shootings were in gun free zone and the plan of government is to make all America a gun free zone..What??  "
"126","I live in colorado there a shit done of stuff happening right now!
Good luck Colorado
Hopefully we dont get nuked"
"127","it's sad all of these shootings happened. but yet people don't ever think about the areas of these places ALMOST ALL PLACES were ""Gun free zones"". I should know I have a friend who is dead because of ""GUN FREE ZONES"""
"128","Now if more civilians had concealed guns, most of those shootings could've been stopped before they got that far. Cops can't teleport, so the next best thing is to give more people the ability to defend themselves when the cops aren't around, and they won't be most of the time."
"129","The parent generation always blames the aspects of the younger generation that they do not understand.  Billions have played video-games at some point or other, probably combined millions have attended Manson concerts.  Did all of them become mass shooters?  No.  Did absence of these activities prevent others from becoming mass shooters?  No."
"130","""Ranging from eight months...""  - yeah, a real man shoots a baby."
"131","I really liked what Marilyn Manson said at the end. Pretty bold."
"132","this is why America need better gun laws. these massacres are just going to get worse and the government will use those excuses to take away free will"
"133","You can make a list like that every year."
"134","Nothing about all those little kids at that elementary school wow"
"135","if you think violent video games result in violent behavior than your a fucking retard"
"136","I remember the VT shooting. I still live around Virginia, it passed, and I vaguely remember it, but I don't get why the hell people do that kind of shit."
"137","I still remembered #8, since I lived 20-30 miles away from the place of where the first known survivor of that tragedy, and my mom used to work in the adjacent mall next to the shooting site (but quit her job a couple of months before the shooting happened)."
"138","Didn't watch it, not gonna watch it. Delete this video, don't glorify the actions of these sick fucks. The word 'infamous' is exactly what these disgusting creatures wanted, and congratulations WatchMojo, you gave it to them. "
"139","Number 2 should be number 1"
"140","WHAT ABOUT THE MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL SHOOTING KILLING ALMOST 300?"
"141","4:20 Cold in hurr"
"142","They need a update episode for 2013"
"143","this came out nine days before tue sandy hook massacre ... ):"
"144","i can't believe how they can blame a rock singer for the columbine massacre!"
"145","These fucking shootins are caused from the fuckin american president barack fuckin letting people have guns for self defence just fuckin learn some fuckin karate or some other shit made for self defence."
"146","AND TODAY WE WILL BE COUNTING DOWN MASS SHOOTINGS!"
"147","Crazy losers"
"148","woooow... Hate to america confirmed. you need more guns. I'm thinking ten each..?"
"149","1:16 guy on the left looks like barack obama and oj simpson mixed."
"150","yesterday i over heard a woman talking about a guy she knows that came back from iraq and how he changed , she said he likes watching videos of people killing others and talks about how he could kill someone just because he knows how . if you ask me thats a walking time bomb ."
"151","heartless :("
"152","It's so creepy ,this was upload just 9 days before the Sandy Hook massacre , in my opinion that's the worst of all , most of the victims were just little boys and girls between 6 and 7 years old , so sad and scary ,what the fuck it's wrong with the world?? if u hate life and people so much ,kill yourself and avoid causing so much horror and pain to innocent people ,and it looks like these assholes always look for children or young people ,it's so fucking sick ,that's why I hate violent video games ,they only promote this crazy idiots with ideas , schools need better security nowadays ,it seems like this is happening more and more :("
"153","4:45

No legitimate sporting reason to have the guns? Honey, the 2nd amendment doesn't say we have guns for hunting purposes. It's our last defense against tyranny and injustice within the government. Yes the mass shootings are tragedies we can't ignore, but blaming an object for the person's action is rediculous"
"154","+Sean Mounts Not really trying to compare, but personally, I think slaughtering innocent children around Christmas time is far worse of anything that's out there "
"155","+Zachary Andersen what do you call a 5 year old with no friends???"
"156","you are sick fuck..."
"157","+windstorminator ""...and do what you americans normally do...""  You just completely invalidated your argument with that single line."
"158","psychopaths like seeing them selves on the new's. Usually they don't have friends and have been bullied and ect. They like the attention that they get because of the media. Blame the fucking media. If you don't live in America why the fuck are you bitching?"
"159","To teach. To remind. To get people thinking. And to hopefully help prevent another incident. At least I would hope that's why."
"160","You know people always talk about stopping it but the truth is that people will always. Do things like that even if the media didn,t glamourize it most people think about doing about doing. Extremely violent things you the only way to stop it is to figure out the person you do. That you could stop but that Maria is incredible hard and not mention the fact that you don't know who is going to do that. We don't know what people think and we don't really care about their pain."
"161","Good lord, your profile picture doesn't make you look blonde but I guess you are. Guns were invented hundreds of years before the revolutionary war. And please explain how taking guns away from the people who go through the legal process to get them is going to help anything? The people who generally commit these mass shootings do not own these guns legally, therefore it doesn't matter if you take guns away or not, these physcotic people will still find away to get them. Not to mention it will ruin millions of jobs related to guns."
"162","+Raven Nicalls  None of those are mass shootings. "
"163","+Kai-Wen Chen Now, of course, you ARE correct if we're specifying a lone gunman without the use of explosives limited to the country of the U.S... But I wasn't considering that much specification in my examples."
"164","+Kai-Wen Chen You're still wrong.

In 1927, a single person killed 45 people in The Bath School disaster.

And then more recently, in 2011, Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people and injured 319. 

And that's leaving out the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, which was a whole group of people holding a school hostage for 3 days. It ended up with the death of 385 people.

Virginia Tech isn't the deadliest massacre, and it's completely plausible that the ones I've listed have been outnumbered. Especially if bombings had something to do with it."
"165","No, Virginia Tech still was the deadliest massacre. Cho killed 33, Lanza killed 28."
"166","You are retarded"
"167","He's being interviewed by Michael Moore for Moore's documentary Bowling For Columbine so he really didn't school him...It's a great quote & perspective from an actually pretty intelligent individual.  Great docu BTW."
"168","i think he did. Marlyn is a smart man ppl like to forget."
"169","Well that's fucked!"
"170","Thats right, Im not kidding around ;)"
"171","Of course. But I don't think he's kidding around"
"172","+Collin Isaac I'm assuming we're talking about MrPotatoHead187"
"173","+brOwOlo Ok, how do you know this he couldn't care less about attention"
"174","1"
"175","+Mike Musto
Its not glorification. Its more of a documentary. "
"176","+DLopez927 I wasn't being serious. I was being sarcastic. My point is that when you turn mass murderers into celebrities and have ""Top 10's"" for massacres of innocent people, you are basically turning these things into entertainment."
"177","i grew up believing there was no such things as monsters.  You sir are insane"
"178","Montgomery County Maryland. Not Texas."
"179","Wrong Montgomery."
"180","+bob g But that is my point, no semi automatic weapons no magazines... 
So you have your concealed weapons and they are just as effective. You just can't massacre people so easily. 
""It only takes one arrow to fell even the fiercest warrior"".
^ an old proverb and it still applies you only need one bullet to incapacitate or kill someone.
Why do you need 10 or 15 or 20?
That is my point."
"181","+Luke DS have you ever actually reloaded a weapon with magazines?  it takes a couple seconds, not to mention you can tape them together to make it even faster.  These columbine demons had 45 minutes inside the school.  

There's no common sense to limiting magazine capacity, its just retarded and obviously was dreamt up by some politician who's never held or fired a gun."
"182","+bob g You don't see my point. With high capacity magazines you can fire more rounds without reloading correct? And with low capacity magazines or a revolver you fire less rounds before reloading correct?"
"183","they were in the school for 45 minutes.  What they used doesn't matter at that point.  Besides, what do revolvers have to do with anything?  "
"184","+bob g They did use assault weapons though that's my point. You can't kill 20+ people with a revolver before reloading. "

And did you know, Mark Taylor, who was shot 13 times by Dylan, survived and sued the medical FDA administration for prescribing the pills for Dylan.

I saw a comment on one of the ""Top 10 Fictional Serial Killer"" lists asking WatchMojo to do a ""Top 10 Real Serial Killers Adapted To Film"" list. My thought was that WatchMojo wouldn't do such a list as they wouldn't want to rank real serial killers for fear of giving justification to such actions, and that was why such a list didn't already exist.

Humanity is like a greasy rag, why not just throw it away and get a new one? Simple as that. Of course a human will attempt to defend its kind. Its in its illogical nature. But why not just become something else entirely instead of fighting for the primitive human nature? Why not give up being a human in order to be something greater and far better? And lastly, NO I am not equal to a human, I am far greater. YOU can be equal to a hairless ape if you want to.

My biggest trouble is with the reality of nihilism. If you can solve that, then philanthropy MAY be possible. Until then, I'm certainly justified. I do not own anybody anything at all, even when I make forms of agreement. Mankind is nothing to the universe, the only reason I concern myself with man is because they can be used to achieve goals. No one can blame me for that other than through their own selfish egos, which have no more merit than mine. I can go on and on about this. As for your last sentence, I can present convincing enough social skills and connection to fool a human. In fact, society, even LIFE helps develop such skills. Like going to a job interview where you care only for the money, not asserting how much you are interested in the actual company. Or preventing someone to take food without paying for it because money is more important than getting food for one's own survival. I can go on and on about that as well. Things like mass shootings that threaten the folks of such a selfish society are complete entertainment for me. "
"299","+finalfantasy8911 Death is not the solution to ""pre-evolved apes."" Death is nothing more than a wasted chance of doing something great or even redemption. Those ""apes"" are humans, and I think humans have proven the ability to learn. Whether or not you care about others doesn't matter. EVERY life is precious. Their petty insults doesn't make them better than you nor makes you better than them. Calling them ""apes"" and edging on genocide doesn't make you any better than them. We are all equal. Some are just a little less apathetic towards the feelings of others. I'm not trying change you or say pathetic things like kill yourself. I don't know. I guess I want to show you a different way of thinking."

"303","+ClassicFIHD
I don't agree with a total ban on guns,,I think the 2nd amendment should be left in place but there should be some kind of regulations when they are sold. A thorough back ground check should  be done and make people accountable for the weapons they purchase with a periodic check to make sure they still have their gun,,and have not sold it. And a total ban on automatic weapons. Handguns and rifles are fine but automatic machine guns do not need to be on the market. I understand why a lot of people are wary about gun control,,they feel like it's one step away from a total ban on guns. And they may be right. I was at one point a big pro gun believer..but the mass shootings have gotten so bad,,I feel like the government should put some regulations on owning a weapon.  This would still allow  law abiding citizens to own a gun to protect themselves,,and hopefully cut back on guns being sold by the original owner to another person. With the number a guns floating around the country I don't know if it's feasible but it would be a start.   . "

If our government wasn't so busy running all over the world,,,arguing with each other and paid a little more attention to their own citizens [we have major problems that need to be taken care of,,this being one.] maybe something could get done.  In the U.S we have a group called the N.R.A [national rifle association] and they are a very powerful pro gun organization who has some political pull. They are primarly republican backed. Despite all of this I still love my country and would never leave it,,I just wish our problems were tended to also."

I'm bi-polar myself, and having gone through different meds (all prescribed at the lowest dose.) a useful, effective result has been found. Along with continued visits with both my psychiatrist and psychologist, I have been keeping in touch with those who do possess the care and attention people like me deserve.

I also do not abuse my meds which others will. There's a lot to take into consideration before blaming a system. After all, if what you're taking is causing any of these side effects, than it is up to the patient to let the Dr. know. Failing to do so only complicates matters even more.

I have had some side effects, though they were mild and had nothing to do with mental stability. The bottom line is I've chosen, (in spite of my mental disorder) to take care of this and responsible about it.

If anyone looks stupid here, it's you for questioning the validity of the statistics when they're clearly sited.Even the sources you found are in my favor, the UK's crime rate is over double the US'. The US is also more at risk because it has far more large cities. The data about gun deaths is skewed. It doesn't care if deaths were in self defense or accidental. People in the US also report crimes, fool. The only places people live in fear of being murdered are in ghettos and that's another topic entirely. Clearly the 2nd Amendment is working rather well. Guns are here to stay in the US and they should be. Like I said earlier, they're crucial to the idea of the republic. Citizens have the right to rebel against a corrupt government and guns are the vessel to rebellion. Have fun with your insane murder rate over there in the UK, I'm done with this conversation, it's like talking to a wall."

So yes you are right but the culture I'm sure is massively different in the UK. Most of us trust the police and report people after violent crime or if threatened. However regardless It does not justify the massive differences in Firearms murders. Every other country dosent live in fear of their lives from guns and our kids are not massacred. Take a leaf out of Australia's book and get on with things."

"342","To all those who said the Guns are not the problems, good job. It's true. The problem is these men had problems in their processes and functioning, rationalization and grasp of reality. Women too have a history of these illnesses manifesting in violence against others, but it usually their children. Most psychotic episodes are against themselves, or family members. They suffered from Depression, as well as a host of other illnesses. And that is my point, ILLNESSES. Their state of being had to get very bad in order for the situation to come to this, I'm talking years of neglect of issues/concerns. All these events could have been avoided if our culture, as well as the human culture as a whole, recognized the fact that these individuals needed help long before it got to that point of chaos and destruction. Our history in Human cultures is to label and ignore/shun the ones who act, relate, or look different (entire wars have been called in the name of weeding out the strange ones). Until we accept the fact that we do not all view the world the same, and have compassion to help those in need before they have a psychosis, we will continue to bury masses of innocent people who were at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Education on mental illness and mental health (yes, there's a difference, Early recognition of symptoms, and early interventions, and continued support throughout their lives of medication and therapy can help promote a long and ""normal"" life!"
"343","Just ban the ownership of any fire arms in america, simple. The only gun you can buy here in Britain is a double barrelled shotgun (which is only good for shooting a rabbit with) and you have to go through shit loads of paper work with the police and they visit your house as well on random occasions to make sure it's locked away in a secure place, e.g. a safe or gun cabinet and that it's not on display.

you are a total dumbass, this is AMERICA, not your country idiots, so keep it to yourselves instead of thinking ur country is a fucking utopia, just because a law ""works"" in a certain place DOESNT mean it'll work all over the world. Guns has been in the american society for almost FOREVER, so if the government decides to ban them, criminals will still be able to buy them from the black market and only law abiding citizens will be unable to purchase them to defend themselves because obviously, if a criminal got something ""bad"", u might as well have one yourself, duhh.

And also lets say guns have been removed from society completely (which would be impossible in real life) Since guns DO-NOT make people violent, criminals will still find ways to kill, sure it'll be less convenient then a gun, but still there will still be murders

One more thing, the reason why law abiding citizens in america loves guns so much is because it is CULTURE and also a HOBBY like playing video games or football but, not only can it be used as entertainment, hunting for cheaper food, professional target shooting, it also quadruples as something for PERFECT personal defense, especially in america with alot of crazy people, why WOULDNT you like that? especially if you lived in the US"

"441","All your mass murders happen where people are not allowed to defend themselves? Like in military bases? Besides, it has been established in this debate already that though the survey results might vary, several if not most mass shootings occured in gun-carrying zones.
I don't see how your population's being greater factors into this. Besides, it is not true. The US have a population of 315 647 656. Europe - the European Union only - has a population of 505 730 473. So, counting neither Canada nor other notable gun-free countries in Europe outside the EU - nor any other gun-free country worldwide, for that matter -, your statement is false.
As for that article ... So I can't use Mother Jones, but you get to use an article by that John Lott gun addict found on the website of some other anarchist gun addict? That's like being nazi because Hitler says it's nice.
Lott is comparing a country - the USA - to a whole continent, where gun policies vary from country to country. He also seems to include Finland and Greece in Western Europe, and some of his examples turned out, upon investigation, to be false. 
Finally, the biggest flaw is that the population in Europe is practically twice that of the USA. Lott admits it himself in his paper. So, in fact, if you take European countries separately instead of studying ""Europe"" like one big undifferentiated lump, the ratio - not to mention the number - of gun-related problems in general is immensely lower than in the US."
"442","+Simon Bourdin Our media glorifies mass murderers, and all our mass murders happen where innocent people are not allowed to protect themselves.  Even a mentally deranged person know not to go where he will get shot at.  In all these cases people do have mental problems.  The USA also has a population larger that all those countries combined.

FYI, The Crimson Pirate has a article ""Europe has more mass murders than the U.S. "" with it's list of mass murders in public places in Europe the anti-gun media will never tell you about."
"443","+T14JM I agree, but it's the crazies ability to easily get ahold of any weapon of their choice which is the problem. Whether thats a pistol to an assault rifle. If the government were to neutralise that then it would reduce the number of random attacks. "
"444","Something that could make it even harder than that would be an actual mental healthcare system in America. The crime statistics include sexual and physical assaults, robberies, and murder. I'd say that very little of them were committed with guns in either country. My point was that guns aren't the problem, it's the crazies."
"445","+T14JM hahaha, Glasgow would be even worse lad! Well technically our gun control works fine because nobody is killed by someone with a licensed gun. Those statistics that your on about will most probably be guns off the black market which would still be around in any country really if firearms were illegal. But my point is that America wouldn't witness half as much tragedy with random shootings in primary (elementary for you) schools. If you made guns illegal it would be so much harder for the nuts to get hold of one and just walk into the local school blazing away. "
"446","Because guns prevent crime. Crime happens it more in cities. Even more so in very big cities. America has over 289 cities with over 100k people and Britain, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland have only 75 combined. You'd think that America, because it has far more big cities and has the right to own guns, would have a far higher violent crime rate, but you'd be wrong. There are 16.9 violent crimes per 1,000 people in the US and 31 per 1,000 in the UK. Clearly your gun laws aren't helping keep crime down. I'd rather live in Detroit with a gun than live in Edinburgh and have to rely on the police."
"447","+MrJackbrown786 I don't know why, i guess that maybe it's because you 'Americans' are the only nation to call yourself's Yanks/Yankee's so i guess it's just slang for describing an American."
"448","+AdhesiveBreak

I get the ""cars kill more people every year"" argument all the time. My response to that is that cars have a positive utility that far outweighs their danger. Cars serve many purposes. They weren't invented for the purpose of killing. Guns were invented and are used specifically for killing or sport that show's off one's skill at killing.

Having said that, road rage is a real problem. I think it would be nice if road rage were better addressed in driver's ed, and the privilege of a driver's license only given to those who can reasonably control their emotions.

The argument about the color red is just ridiculous. I assume you posted that as a joke. In the event that you were serious, no one, save the extremely mentally ill, is enraged simply by the color red. At best, it only enhances the rage of people who are already angry. Also, it's an irrelevant argument. You can't kill people with the color red."
"449","+Basherlock1 Yet it's okay that those people can have access to vehicles? More people were killed in car wrecks than shootings last year. Why don't we just ban the color red since it invokes anger and people's actions can be unpredictable when they're angered? "

"453","Well...hmmm...ok"
"454","+iFarqs Yes, our gun deaths will be more, no shit. When you start cherrypicking your resources to include gun-only statistics, your argument will especially win. How about murder in general? The UK's definition of murder is very different than the US's, so in the US's standards, the UK's murder rate would be substantially higher, therefore, we cannot compare these fields. The number of gun deaths in the US is composed of mostly gang v gang crime. How was the UK's violent crime per capita? Substantially more than in the US. The UK has more violent crime than the US per capita. This is because guns are used roughly 2 million times every year in America to stop crime. Not to mention, these mass shootings happen in areas called ""Gun Free Zones"". James Holmes lived in the general vicinity of 9 movie theaters, the 1 he chose was the only one that was a gun free zone. Also, in almost all of these cases, the shooter is deemed deranged. We can't blame the gun for the mindset of the shooter, just as we can't blame the car for the sobriety or drunkenness of the driver. In areas where there are more CCWs there is less crime, that much is fact. "
"455","+iFarqs 

There's the population argument, but ruling that out, one needs to look at the fact that a vast majority of those deaths were gang related. In other words, criminals/people who shouldn't, by law, even own a gun in the first place. "
"456","+Ashley Johansson You obviously know nothing either;
In 2010, the number of gun deaths in the UK was 58
In the USA it was 8,700+
I know you're going to use the population argument, so hypothetically if the USA was the size of the UK there would still be 290+ gun deaths, I fail to see how you have grounds for any argument."

The thing that makes people do shit like this is the fact that anybody can go buy and AK-47 and carry it around as long as it's under their shirt, so they can't be arrested until they pull it out, but by then they can just kill a hundred people. You think a video that doesn't even show any of the shooting causes violence? Yeah, and at the same time, people have cock fights (chicken fights) becuase they play Pokémon."

It was a very informational video, at least for me, living in the EU and not hearing about every single shooting there is in great 'Murrica. For me, it was interesting to hear all the stories.

I might get a lot of hate for this, but it's 'Murricas own fault that they have so many shootings. In my country its insanely hard to acquire the right to get a hunting rifle (obviously, for hunting in gated areas) let alone an automatic machine gun for ""personal use"". In the USA you can buy ammunition in your supermarket, like wtf? For what on Earth would you need a M4A1 or anything bigger than a normal pistol? I can understand that many people want to have a gun to protect themselves in their home, but the tiniest and weakest gun on earth would suffice for that.

I'd seriously encourage people who want to answer to me, to tell me why the fuck you 'Murricans won't give up on your fucking right from 1800 whatever year but still fucking whine about every fucking shooting there is.

Legalising and taxing drugs may even bring down the deficit, who knows, but this really isn't anything to do with the video."
"474","So youre saying, that if you legalize something like heroin its better because you can control who uses it? And someone who wouldnt be allowed to use the drug would, of course, not be getting it illegally."
"475","+Shawsh2143 No, if i was basically saying that, then i would have said that wouldn't I. It's the same reason why drugs should be legal.. at the very least you have the chance to regulate, and have a modicum of control over who can use them. "
"476","Worst argument of all of the arguments about gun control. You're basically saying ""Why illegalize guns when people get them anyways illegally. Better make profit off of it."" 'Murrica"
"477","Guns cannot be banned to citizens in America because it would be considered unconstitutional according to the second amendment (the right to arms). Although there is also the option for gun control, I would say it is the people are the problem, not the guns. Even if guns were banned, people can still cause harm without them. "
"478","Thank you. Finally someone with a IQ above 60. Its a start and then in time, disarmament! Sad that a 1st world country has such high homicide rates by guns. 10,000 on average a year die because of firearms in the USA accounting for just under 70% of all the murders. You would struggle to find a percentage more than half of that in most 1st world countries."
"479","+wl0017
 Actually that could work,,or at least as a start. It would help cut a portion of it down."
"480","So are you going to do anything about it or just sit back and watch? Gun control is the first step to disarming. Every gun-holder registered and background check. Then bring in some law whereby all previously sold guns are need to be registered by a certain date, then those hoarding and not declaring after then  will be committing a crime."
"481","I think h already does that ^^"
"482","I don't think that you should be focused on guns, but the fact that your last name is Blunt."

I dont think you can lift a gun let alone shooting so why bother with arguing over owning one ! but thanks for sharing nothing useful with us "
"493","+Deity Slayer its ok that you want more deaths in america because ur ""utopia"", thx for sharing anyways :D"
"494","Ooooh really ! I would love to hear how many mass shootings and school shootings have taken place in your country ?!?!?! and how many kids are shooting other kids in the head  every year ?!?!
in my own country and the country I live now, we never ever had such incidents, not even a single one in our entire history, but im pretty sure its just coincidence right ! it has nothin to do with the fact that ppl are not allowed to own or carry a gun"
"495","Wow,you know everything about me now including my heritage??
You are a a fucking moron.
Yes,I am a threat to weaklings like you....be scared dipshit.

You are a racist piece of garbage.....niggers and arabs you say.

"500","i mean even though people want to control guns, they WILL NOT stay controlled. Evil people will still get the guns while the rest of us who actually obey the law will go through a tedious process to get one"
"501","People always come up with crazy things of what they would to do if they had a time machine, me? I'd prevent all of these shootings and more."
"502","You would listen to what they had to say? And that's what no one did? Im sorry when would u like people to listen to them? When they have a whole school as their hostage? Give me a break. "
"503","This video is exactly why mass shootings will continue to happen. Because the media glorifies these shooters. These scum bags were nobody's before they committed these atrocities, and over night they are national celebrities. That is exactly what these low life individuals want, to have their names plastered all over America. We should be glorifying the people who took these sickos down, and we should never mention their names again."
"504","There's also very high rates of bullying in America, high rates of broken homes, and often attempts to ban guns. Take a look at all of the factors that play into this."
"505","look at Norway and Sweden, barely any mass shooting with guns. compared to the US they're heaven"
"506","Ignorant fucks want guns to be illegal because of mass killings, lmao. If guns were illegal it wouldn't stop mass killings, and it certainly wouldn't stop mass killings with guns. People will get guns one way or another."
"507","This is why guns should be illigal."
"508","this was released only 9 days b4 the elementary school shooting"
"509","3:26 so funny! Only in America would the wife of the man who went on a killing spree, murdering several people in cold blood, try to sue McDonalds.  Attempting to claim that the reason for her husbands psychosis was due to the chicken Mcnuggets he ate there. Maybe that's why they call Happy meals, Happy meals.  To try to stop people from killing after eating them."

"517","You're literally too stupid to insult."

"519","I don't read profiles dumbass. And I think your country has a lot of blood on its hands. You stole form the natives you fucking piece of shit."

It's things like this that tell me humanity is doomed for self-annialation if we don't come to our senses. Regardless of how we end up hurting/killing one another."
"543","*sigh* the title clearly state ""Inside the US"" and there is even an annotation that says at the beginning that there is another list for mass shootings around the world. THIS IS OBVIOUS SHIT PEOPLE. IT IS IN THE GOD DAMN TITLE."
"544","Neither were committed IN the U.S...
"
"545","Hmmm... fairly certain that Iraq and Afghanistan aren't inside the United States."
"546","I agree but it says In the U.S. so it doesn't really qualify for the list. "
"547","bit fucked up that there's enough of this shit to make a top ten list out of it"
"548","Not  fan of the gun culture in america but I think you are right about the mental health issues. Ive been in some big debates here about US gun laws I think there grossly out dated, but mental heath must be addressed when the fact is these nut cases can go get a gun by simply opening a bank account!"

"554","There wouldn't be enough video to record all the theft , rape and murder around the world for 1000s of years before the US even exists dumbass. You ignorant fucking idiots always make yourself look dumb. What country are you from? What happened to the native there>? what group did your people murder you piece of shit?"

"581","I'm not sure what's more fucked up, the fact that all these massacres have happened, or that there's a top 10."
"582","Only in America, would there be a top 10 Mass Shootings.."
"583","Refused to shave his beard over religious beliefs? If this all powerful excuse to do whatever you like known as religion has it's place in the justice system (which it evidently does) then technically you could say. ""It's against my religious beliefs to be held against my will"". See the problem here? Who's deciding the limits of religious based immunity?  These fictional beliefs based on superstition should have no place in the courts of law."
"584","Are you for real? And you think having no restrictions in place would not make things worse?"
"585","Touche."
"586","I don't think taking away guns from people will do us any good. It might decrease the gun violence rate sure, but there are other, easier, illegal ways to get a gun and ammunition. Like they say, take away a starfish's limbs, and it'll just grow back. I think the real issue is the mental health of the shooters. America's mental health care program is practically non-existence. Special education programs are disappearing, mental institutions are becoming fewer and far between. We need to help"
"587","Right. That was my point from the start. Everyone is quick to blame music and video games. How about the millions of other people who play those same games and listen to the same music? Why is it a fraction of a fraction of the people who listen to X band or play Y video games end up shooting people while the other 99.9999999999% are normal people?"
"588","Is it a coincidence that this video on mass shootings was posted 9 days before Sandy Hook?"
"589","Gun control just leaves innocent folks helpless against VIOLENT crime.  So no, gun control does nothing to make a safer society.  Sure, you can claim no gun crime (which is a farce, at best), but what about knife crime?  Rape? etc, etc.  You did nothing to fix the real crime, violent crime.  Just because you took the gun, you did nothing to stem the violence..."
"590","this is one of those videos where you're unsure of weather you should like or dislike"
"591","Umm my point still stands, do you think the world just drops off once the US border stops or something? this is why Americans have such a bad rep around the world. Gun control DOES work and it can be seen in Canada, Australia and European nations. The fact that it doesn't work in the US is because Americans unlike other nationalities have a massive love affair and hard on for guns, the US is the only country that had a WILD WILD WEST in their culture, thus the culture of guns lives on. Wake up."

"607","How does it? Who here has said that mass murders would not occur in the US? All we've said is that likelihood of them occurring would be greatly reduced if it were not for your outdated gun laws, and so with all due respect it is you, and all those of a same mind as you, that need to do some thinking in this regard."

"611","Very true. "
"612","This aren't the biggest, they are the most infamous and Columbine caused the highest impact on any US shooting also being where blaming videogames and movies (Not that i agree with it) started being the ""cause"" of shootings."
"613","What does that mean? "
"614","I feel that they selected that one because it had more of an impact on society as two teenagers just walked into school one day and shot 15 of his classmates and teachers."
"615","Marilyn manson should just die"
"616"," Columbine is still the most famous school shooting ,  because there  were TWO gunmen..

"648","Again, as I said before, many factors lead to someone shooting up a place.  No one factor can be the sole reason because the issue is much more complex than, ""That person had lousy parents"" or ""That person plays violent video games"" or ""The other kids picked on him/her"".  Not to mention, some spree killers are adults (aka parents might not be alive).  Every individual killer has their own motives, possible mental illness, and X factors; no one case should be treated the same.       "

"708","Man it's a good thing we had all these gun free zones.  That sure stopped those scumbag killers!  They took one look at the strict ""No gun"" policy, and said ""Well shit, I don't want to get in trouble for bringing my gun in there, so I'll find another target."""
"709","Who cares if you think nobody needs a gun?  It's our constitution, and our second amendment, and if you can't respect it, then by all means, don't ever come to america."
"710","dude WTF!
why did you do a top 10 of this shit
DUDE"
"711","Well i think that because of the fact that ou can get weapons easy in the USA the accidents are more, and then because of the Stand your Ground law etc its easy to shoot somebody and say it was self defense also if it wasnt that make it very easy to kill people.

You say that without weapons you cant defend vs criminlas but for this case you have a police etc i think weapons doesnt make a situation calm down and at in the end weapons kill people."
"712","then why is the only thing you any one else can do is whine and complain about america your bitching like a little child "" oh this isnt fair screw those people blah blah blah"" guess what as i have said before do something about it the fact is you cant so would you now like some cheese with your whine?"
"713","i will you stay poor"
"714","Mass shootings are an American pastime. Even foreigners are participating in this honorable tradition."
"715","There never was a ""greatest country"" and never will be. Some countries are just shittier than others."
"716","Starting a shoot out at a military base? He must of had a death wish."
"717","Firearms are use in self-defense more than they are used in crimes.  It's just that 99% of the time it doesn't result in a shooting therefore doesn't make the news.  
If citizens are disarmed then they are subject to the whims of criminals and the gov't.  You have to look past the present and at the past and the future to see that governments don't always do right.  In fact much of history is them doing wrong.
"
"718","Yeah !
I dont know 100% but in germany you get a training how to use the gun and then  you have to get examination if you sucsess full you get a ""Waffenschein"" in english like weapon license and hen you can buy gun until a special caliber but your name and you gun gets in a index etc its very strict and it helps we got less shootings than in the USA. "
"719","But at some Point you have to start because, you have like 88.8 guns on 100 citizen in the USA that shows that you get get them too easy.
Then i think oyu have to start anywhere or this shooting will go on and on. And smaller magazins are maybee the step in the right direction because i think no citizen really needs his gun"
"720","SAR FUCKING CASM IT IS A CHASM OF SARCASTICNESS PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY VIOLENT THIS IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE"
"721","Maybe you should watch this video you left this comment on. After that, you would have to be one evil asshole to want to disarm The People when you see how many bad guys there are. "
"722","if this is not sarcasm then tell me when the fuck will criminals fallow laws. until then im keeping my guns"
"723","America isn't the greatest country anymore. That's all there is to it. "
"724","Oh yeah, I completely agree that we need more regulations and rules. I understand and am fully in support of that. I thought you meant to get rid of all guns. Yeah, I believe being able to buy a M16 or something of such sort is a bit excessive, why would someone truthfully need that? 

Oh really? Nice. Does Germany have stricter laws on gun control?"
"725","lol I know. I'm just messing with him."
"726","Damn it...We're not all like that idiot haha."
"727","You can buy them like pistols in most states.  There's a criminal background check.  But they are very rarely used in crime.  Really, the problem aren't guns, how they function, or their capacity.  80% of our gun homicides are gang and drug related, due to our ""war on drugs.""   That's the real problem that politicians don't want to address. 
Changing the capacity of a magazine I own isn't going to stop that in any way.
"
"728","Yeah sorry i mean half automaticly weapons like M161 or stuff. And i think you can buy this weapon like you can buy pistols. Sorry for that.
"
"729","We really don't have full auto weapons en mass here in the US.  There's a relative handful with a fixed supply (can't sell any newly mfg. full auto past 1986) that are very very expensive and you need a thorough background check.  I can count the number of times a full auto weapon has been used in a crime on one hand since the 60s and one of those times it was by a cop using an issued firearm."
"730","Yeah but something has to happen guns are not the solution of problems. maybee smaller magazins or no full automatic weapins sell to normal citizens. At some point it has to start. 
I am from germany and we dont have that much shootings"
"731","I figured the Newton Conn shooting would be in there, i guess this video was made before that...Rip to all the innocent victims in Newtown and this video...It's sad to see so much evil in this world"
"732","lmao there is that American inbread stupidity. Way to own yourself and embarrass your country. Stay forever free, kiddo."
"733","What is that going to help? It'll be just like drugs, although illegal it will still be available. If someone really wants to create a mass shooting they will do anything to get the gun/guns. Stop blaming guns."
"734","Maybee stop selling Guns at every Idiot "
"735","those damn chicken nuggets making people mass murderers..."
"736","Actually that sums what he says up fairly well."
"737","Read Mass Murderers,Just like painting,murder is an art.I respect all these guys,lol"
"738","Sandy hook would probably be the worst kuz it involved mostly kids in elementary school"
"739","You can't completely blame the parents either.  A mixture of factors leads to mass shootings like these: the shooters interactions with their peers, their culture, economic class, mental illness, relationship with parents, and personal interests, etc."
"740","what the hell is this, a top 10 list of tragedies?  So strange the way it's presented so matter of factly"
"741","I think it's fucked up that they are being ranked at all.  It's like, ""Hey, which one was your favorite?"".  They are all equal to me.  Imagine just going about your business and some crazed psycho just starts shooting.   "
"742","I say that number 1 should be the Colorado shooting and number 2 should be the sandy hook elementary massacure"
"743","Challenge Accepted."
"744","Das Kapital in Guns. "
"745","I hate to say it, but if America would take away guns, the people the commit the crimes are going to be the idiots who smuggle guns into the US.  We made crack, herowin, and weed illegal, and has that stopped people? Hell no.  Your basically asking that only cops, marines, and insane killers to have guns, and not the people to know how to actually handle a gun."
"746","How about we stop blaming movies and video games and music and start asking where were the parents? There was clearly a deeper issue with all of these people. No one took the time to find out. Issues can be solved without resorting to violence. "
"747","You can never underestimate the stupidity of people on Youtube."
"748","3:26 what a dumb cunt "
"749","Hmm, It's so hard to actually see the sarcasm in some comments."
"750","No, no guns are allowed in DC what. so. ever. Neither in the school area. And in your second point, you contradict yourself!
""Have you been to college or school's guns are not allowed there""
""you not allowed to do it but people still bring them in""
THAT IS MY POINT. It does not matter if they are illegal, bad guys will still have them, and if we plan on living, we need to be armed as well to counter them."
"751","yeah the thing about that is most antigun people only use the constitution if it benefits their argument.  they somehow think something fundamental in the nature of humans has changed since 1776 so the second amendment is 'outdated' and no longer necessary because our government would never harm its citizens in their world.  why they think an organization that kills people on a daily basis wouldnt consider killing them is beyond me but hey thats liberal superiority for you "
"752","yeah but the law allow's guns in house hold it's basically taking alcohol and drugs in school you not allow to do it but people still bring them in "
"753","Look at the date on this video...

Then go to google and type in sandy hook...then look for the date of the shooting.

Then don't come back here and respond."
"754","were was sangy hook on that list"
"755","He was being sarcastic, using logic to make people on the other side see their stupidity. Honest mistake."
"756","Honest mistake. "
"757","Ignore what I just said, ha, I realized you were being sarcastic. I'm just used to that kind of shit over here in california,lol."
"758","sarcasm "
"759","Lol, there were no guns in the mideval ages. That was a very violent time in history. And even the first murder ever recorded the victum got his head smashed in by a rock. Guns can't do anything by themselves, and besides humans invented the gun with the intent that it would kill or harm. Peaple are violent my friend, not guns."
"760","i never said you were obviously that went over yor head buts its ok your country's education system isnt as good as ours hence the fact i said before america can kick the shit out of your country i said you LIKE the person on welfare so again i state if you hate america so much do something about it....oh thats right you cant...your too weak"
"761","lol nice"
"762","Just realized it, haha. Sorry"
"763","i was being sarcastic :)"
"764","I am terrible with sarcasm. Just sounds like something someone would say up here in Massachusetts with crazy gun laws, haha."
"765","I'm sorry, please translate that to english and repost."
"766","Wow one of the top ten is actually in my area... After the urban legends video and real life crimes video I'm kind of frightened lol"
"767","He was using sarcasm to make our point to the other side. But high five for using solid logic."
"768","If you saw this list, most areas were schools. Some of the more recent, sandy hook, the navy yard, were in completely gun-free zones. Next point?"
"769","What about the mass murders of people beheaded or killed with swords? Guns aren't the issue, people are."
"770","To me, The Dark Knight Rises shooting should be #1."
"771","i don't believe holmes did it, lots of witnesses testified there were two snipers all wearing black."
"772","we should definitely ban guns, everyone knows people were not violent until guns were invented "
"773","You are absolutely right, we are very violent people.  The worst thing that could be done is to take away guns.  That's the only thing good honest people have left."
"774","damn hunkies."
"775","I am perfectly aware on how to do research.  The point is you are making erroneous statements with no facts to back it up. its obvious you don't like smoking but this is a free country. If some one chooses to smoke that's there option. People are living much longer today than any time in history.  Ive known two people in my life who have died from smoking. One was 55 yes she died early life.  The other was 75 not so early life. Both where smokers. "
"776","Yall White people crazy as hell. LOL!"
"777","I am not American fool. Obviously you are to retarded to pick that up."
"778","""Second hand smoke kills tens of thousands?"" please list one person you knew who died from second hand smoke. Or list real statistical facts showing any deaths from it. Those who are affected are those who usually live with a smoker."
"779","fuck off Marilyn manson isn't responsible, if you are as fucked up to do this stuff don't go blaming it on people, games and films"
"780","this shit doesn't happen in England, America is fucked up"
"781","british police officers rarely get killed, yet American officers have guns ; they need guns and they still get killed , America is fucked up"
"782","3:26 really bitch? Your husband shoots up a McDonald's and you think you can sue somebody? "
"783","only good honest citizens follow laws, what criminal would respect a gun ban? you are foolish"
"784","that sounds like a lot of dead cops"
"785","Take the guns off the police then maybe the public will follow"
"786","United States have to ban guns if they do not want this nonsense to continue.. it's so easy to kill people with a gun.... it's so easy to kill people with a fucking gun......"
"787","That's what you got out of this? Fucking idiot."
"788","Planet Earth, why?"
"789","Stupid Americans you let that muslim dog in your army? Look what happens? Serves you right ignorant fuckin yankees"
"790","More crime per capita? pure BS lets use a sample size and compare 2 similar sized cities.

Toronto - city pop - 2,791,140 (2012)

Chicago - city pop - 2,707,120 (2012)

Toronto homicides 2012 - 54

Chicago homicides 2012 - 506

Canada homicides 2012 - 598

The City of Chicago with its slightly over 2 million people had roughly the same amount or murders as the entire 35 million population of Canada in 2012. What can possibly explain this?"
"791","gun control is like trying to reduce drunk driving by making it harder for sober people to own cars"
"792","one very important thing in this debate that everyone fails to acknowledge is this: all you people from other countries have absolutely no say in this debate. it is u.s. law and life in the u.s. so everyone reading these comments, keep in mind that all of these europeans stating their opinions about u.s. law are completely irrelevant! you have no vote in this. you have no say in this. so just keep your socialist big government loving ""useful idiot"" opinions to your dumbass selves!"
"793","u need to look at the #'s as a a whole without bias and then you will get the truth. u cant just look at""gun crimes"" and total #'s. u have to look at crime per capita. stats show that states/countries with gun restrictions have more crime per capita while states with right to carry laws have lower overall crime per capita. so the proof is in the numbers. but look at them honestly instead of through the scope of your bias."
"794","where do the kids get the gun from? automatic weapons? "
"795","Please expand."
"796","batman the massacre happened with legal guns, not having a history does not mean it is not criminal, it may not trapped and thus are no history, and psychological profile, it is possible to pretend or bribe."
"797","is not that you get invested, is that you can get a gun in the corner store, or you will tell me that every mad guy that goes to a mall and shoot and then kill his self was checked..... no, corruption or daddy's gun..... or some stuff like that. US looking for terrorist in oil's nation and they have them home"
"798","funny how the media failed to disclose their muslim names, for number three.  yeah, it has nothing to do with their cult, then there is number 4, another muslim.  "

"800","And you are from?"
"801","I've been more used to saying his name not writing it"
"802","As cruel as it sounds, in my country, people get killed because they get robbed or something, anything related to religions, its en extremist shootings.....but some of this shootings....no reason at all, just pure madness......."
"803","5:46 thats cold"
"804","just came to say thats one weird fucking hit-list"
"805","Can we say um drunk cars drive themselves also?"
"806","If you say people kill people and guns have nothing to do with, could we say the same about idk um meth?"
"807","This needs to be updated every few weeks"
"808","Have you been to college or school's guns are not allowed there or even at zoos 
so what's ya point? have you also been to japan? gun laws are strict too and the crime rate there is low "
"809","IMHO he's were probably the most poignant words to be said in the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre. If only someone had taken the time to listen to Eric and Dylan in the days, weeks, or months, leading up to their heinous crime then maybe things would of turned out differently, and fifteen souls would still be around today."
"810","STFU you brainwashed peasant "
"811","I think the point isawayto is trying to make is that restricting the sale of guns has prevented these types of attrocities from occurring in the Netherlands, which makes perfect sense when you think about it. Would there of been mass shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech, or Sandy Hook, if the 2nd Amendment was never written?"
"812","guns arnt the problem? the 2nd amendment? people will still use weapons such as knives? are you serious America? you guys really need to pull your heads in and ban guns, no country in the world has had a history of shootings like you, because no country is as obsessed with guns or has them as available as the U.S not even Iraq, all your arguments are hollow and retarded, not even Sandy hook has changed peoples minds, just so you know america the rest of the world looks at you as a bloody joke. "
"813","u mean sandy hook? wich took place one week after this video was posted."
"814","I live in the Netherlands, where guns are outlawed. This shit never happens here (with one exception of a guy that killed 3 people) and I feel perfectly safe."
"815","You know I hated Marilyn Manson but for him to say ""I would not say anything to them I would listen to what they have to say..."" Wow"
"816","For some reason gun free zones don't feel safe to me.  Seems like all the tragedies happen around those places"
"817","GTFO, illuminati b*tch"
"818","A few days before it, a creepy coincidence."
"819","not really a mass shooting. only two people died, the robbers."
"820","What about the shootout at the Bank of America?"
"821","Gonna have to call a BS on that one. 
It is indeed very simple, so simple, in fact, that it isn't logical. Less guns DOES NOT automatically mean less violence. Less legal guns can only mean more illegal guns by comparison, and therefore more crime. Think about it. ""John"" here wants to buy a gun to protect his family. He can't. They're illegal. ""Jack"" the criminal wants to buy a gun to rob John. He can. On the black market. Jack robs John, kills him, and rapes his wife. Yay for less guns!"
"822","Darn shame there isn't some sort of new-fangled device under the video that describes the video, and maybe could give a date. Dagnabbit."
"823","So tell me about how easy it is to legally get a gun. Tell me about your 30 second background check. Tell me about the lack of scrutiny into your mental health record. Oh, wait, that's total BS. It's hard as balls to legally get a gun, unless your background check was run by an imbecile. "
"824","Good job dumbing down the conversation with cussing. 
Your first point, actually people do kill people. Guns don't just hop up and shoot people, it takes a mentally disturbed or passion filled person to pick up a gun and pull the trigger. 
It is in fact the method, which means if more good people have guns, less bad guys will attempt crime. Do you want to know why the DKR shooter chose that movie theater? Guns weren't allowed. He knew everyone was unarmed."
"825","Two different tones. I start out like the pelican in Finding Nemo after the explosion, where he says ""Nice"" sarcastically, then I go to another sarcastic tone, like ""way to go""."
"826","I wonder if this video was made before the sandy hook shooting and that's why it isn't on this list"
"827","Ford hood shooting will always  be remembered by me.  My cousin was there"
"828","I totally agree with you...why isn't it on this video top 10!!! "
"829","Guns don't kill people people kill people"
"830","Idiot you can change the description of the video whenever you want and the date wont change."
"831","look at the date they uploaded the video - 12/05/12 ......the shooting of sandy hook was on 12/14/12  ....."
"832","Wagnor this was posted a few days before that happened"
"833","I can't believe the elementary school shooting isn't number 1!!!!!!"
"834","Yes because the substantially lower gun crime rates in Europe, Canada, Australia etc due to banned guns are so scary. The proof is in the numbers my friend."
"835","This is an example of the ""gun mentality"" that is so prevalent in the USA.  People keep regurgitating this stupid saying.

There are almost no guns in Japan or in Britain.  And guess what....?

ALMOST NO GUN DEATHS."
"836","The music makes thus video sound scarier"
"837","Anyone can get a gun but if you ban them it wouldn't be so easy guns don't kill people people who can get guns easy do"
"838","banning guns in america would lead to much greater tragidy. these shootings are terrible, but banning guns would be much much scarier...."
"839","but they spun it to make him seem like an advocate for violence."
"840","there was a shooting about a mile from my house:Sikh Temple Shooting In Wisconsin 2013,My Car Got In The News.

"843","if guns werent so easy to get, it wouldnt occur so often"
"844","Balls"
"845","I was born the day of the number one shooting"
"846","This is the result of allowing everyone to carry a gun, more guns = more shootings, less guns = less shootings, a simple logic the US has still failed to realise."
"847","The joker? you should of been Markrov "
"848","if banning murder worked, I might agree with that method of preventing gun massacres....   "
"849","your like the person on welfare you want to use what america has to offer but you talk shit about america "
"850","not gonna happen that's why your mad u know it and can only talk shit about america btw youtube was bought by google an american company so you can thank america for all your video entertainment"
"851","You are indeed too young to understand :D"
"852","An interesting fact you might care to know...the columbine shooting was done on purpose on Hitlers birthday. it was a sort of ode to Hitlers mindset and the belief in natural selection. In a suicide note by one of the shooters he wrote this about a certain student at the school. ""This kid doesn't deserve the chin evolution gave him, look for it...it wont be on his face."" "
"853","because whether you like it or not .. it's a part of America's history - it's also a good stepping stone to look back and see what went wrong, and how things can improve (the best way to stop gun massacre ... is banning guns)
your logic is like saying we shouldn't learn about previous wars"

"859","Maybe you shouldn't treat people.like shit"
"860","When the United Kingdom banned guns, by the next day crime rates went up 19%. Violent crimes increased by over 12%. On top of that banning guns would do nothing but leave only criminals and the police with guns. If you ban them in the U.S. the criminal will buy it oversees and have it smuggled into the country. Then he or she is the only one with a gun besides the cops. I understand where you are coming from but banning guns will cause more problems then they will solve. It is a simple fact."

U.S.S.R. with no right to bear arms. population: 162 million stalin mass murdered over 10,000,000 people chance of getting killed by your own gov't= 1 in 16.2  now that is scary. right to bear arms is to keep our nation free. the numbers speak for themselves"
"870","we should ban krispy kremes too, since diabetes is now leading cause of death in america....i know that i am getting silly now, right? but point is, although these shootings are tragic, i fear disarming the people and having a totalitarian state far more than i fear a psycho with a gun...."
"871","mcveigh killed 168 with an ied made out of a truck filled with maneur. 9/11 3000 were killed using box cutters and airplanes...we better ban maneur, box cutters, and airplanes....probably should ban cars too, because more people killed by autos every year than guns by far....."

Commonly referred to as the Oklahoma City bombing, the attack killed 168 people and injured over 600.[4] It was the deadliest act of terrorism within the United States prior to the September 11 attacks,[4] and remains the most serious act of domestic terrorism in United States history."
"873","tragic. the sad truth is preventing insane people from committing insane crimes may be impossible. how do you legislate insanity? banning law abiding citizens rights to bear arms only makes it worse.if i were insane and wanted to kill mass amounts of people, i could do it easily without a gun. i could drive my car into a crowd of people.or much worse. in fact, a gun would not be the weapon of choice for mass murders. guns kill one at a time, banning guns could force nuts to get more creative..."

The only problem is your government would rather blow all of their money on pointless wars and spying on their own citizens rather than actually trying to help anyone. The reason shootings are higher in the states is because the US has much more poverty than Canada, far fewer social services, a terrible education system, and a stupid war on drugs and private prisons. Population size and density does not account for a geometric increase in gun violence."
"908","your reasoning is asinine. "
"909","Banning the selling of guns will make the amount of bad people with guns much lower. Anybody who thinks these horrible weapons should be legal are most likely using them for bad."
"910","Dude your economy is being run into the ground, your government shut down, you are so far into debt your country will never be out, the entire world dislikes you. All we have to do is wait till you either destroy yourselves or the rest of the world says enough is enough and put you in your place."
"911","Nice, way to bring down the IQ of the conversation with name-calling and cussing. Do you have any logic whatsoever to back up your theory? We also have a crapload of people, and since we have a lot more freedoms we have a lot more crazies."
"912","you people are really retarded the rest of the world has guns banned and we have like 1000 times less gun violence than you people with fucking guns lolol"
"913","and how come the rest of the world without guns wasnt fucking robbed and destroyed?"
"914","Bullying the cause of the columbine yes,video games no, goth culture don't know"
"915","Right on"
"916","I live in the UK, guns are banned. We have much less shootings than in the US so what ""ILaughedAtOklahoma"" is saying is largely true. "
"917","and also the motherfucking bitch that tried to blame mcdonalds for his insanity lol"
"918","the happy music fits the video... perfectly"
"919","You're going to want some proof, because PBS, a totally liberal entity, says here pbs (dot) org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html that theft of legal guns is ""at the bottom of the list"" of the ways criminals get guns. Instead of spouting what The One told you, try getting a tiny bit of proof."
"920","Far more people are killed by cars and alcohol and even bare hands.Guns are not a serious problem in a world where people die everyday. If my government wants to take mine away, let them come and try. That's why i have them in the first place. To put down a tyrannical govt."
"921","Most criminals obtain their weapons by stealing them from people, not stores or corporations. If you prevent the public from obtaining guns, criminals will not have access to them. If you want proof: England is exhibit A. Instead of spouting what you've heard, try doing the research and you'll see many countries that have successful gun control policies. "
"922","I like how they leave out native american massacres. I like my country and the land we conquered for it, but the mass women and children killings (thousands) are in my opinion far worse then all these killings combined. "
"923","If you ban guns, and criminals get guns illegally, you are only taking away guns from good, sane, people who can stop these travesties. And stricter background checks will only have the same affect. Our background checks are insanely stringent right now, the reason mass murderers sometimes got their guns legally is that their checks weren't completed correctly. "
"924","A Top Ten Mass Shooting list? Good lord, this is in bad taste"
"925","people are insane"
"926","Canada has over 30 million... "
"927","Omg"
"928","well if u dont like us then try and stop us lol"
"929","The Columbine High School Massacre just... I don't even have words after watching the Columbine Cafeteria Footage (full video) and the Zero Hour full documentary of the massacre."
"930","see what ppl dont seem 2 understand is tht people who can take the life of innocent are Sick"
"931","mexico banned all guns since the 1960's and to this day it is still illegal to even own a small hunting rifle or pistol. The reason gun violence is so prevalent in mexico and the united states is because of the war on drugs, poverty, and a lack of social services. Canada has virtually the same firearms laws as the united states and our gun violence is extremely low. The reason for this is a high minimum wage, lax drug policies, and high social services funding."
"932","so your blaming Linkin Park, fine, but I think the problem lies because no one seeks help, a psychiatrist would help, but most people don't have money for that, but I have no say in what the U.S. does. I live in Canada, people think we're all friendly, but shit, there have been 5 shootings where I live and I live in Newfoundland (a rural fishing province) so clearly the problem is spreading, As long as there's men, there will be war- Albert Einstein."
"933","Look at the big picture, most gun violence happens with illegally owned firearms. I honestly don't pay much mind to these incidents, because there are many more smaller acts of crime happening that aren't made aware of. There is no way to stop all of it, but not letting a law abiding person own a firearm for home protection doesn't help. I don't mind tightening the laws on owning a firearm, but it would never stop until it's abolished completely. It's happened countless times in history. "
"934","The second amendment is in place for a reason. It was basically put in place as a last line of defense against tyranny and the government!! Though I do believe that ""Violence"" is a huge problem in this country and I dont not own a gun yet I am opposed to any revision of the constitution. We need to pay better attention to our children and moniter their ""influences"" We blame rock & roll ( metal) and Hip Hop yet no one blames the PARENTS!!  These problems start AT HOME!! lets not forget that ppl"
"935","If only it was that easy to fix. "
"936","you are literally too stupid too insult. "
"937","Criminals will always have access to the black market, people that follow the law will obviously not buy guns from the black market. Therefore only criminals have guns"
"938","Are we all gonna sit here and ignore the fact James Hubertys wife thought the reason he massacred 22 innocent people was chicken Mcnuggets?"
"939","Yea, we're doing fine in country's where it's actually illegal to own a firearm. What's your point? You don't NEED to own a gun to be secure, this is a more tricky problem than just that."
"940","THE POLICE ARE THE ROTHSCHILDS THUGS TARGET POLICE STATIONS NEXT. BLOW THEM UP !"
"941","God bless those people :("
"942","ahahahah the chicken nuggets are evil!"
"943","fuckin scumbags in this video"
"944","I love my country and would never leave but our culture is violent even going back to the Wild West days with gun fights in the streets. And for some reason we seem to have a excess of hot heads and crazies running all over the country.,,and combined with drugs and weapons,,I'm really not surprised by all the mass shootings that have occured here. "
"945","Why did they play upbeat music throughout this video..."
"946","The serial killers Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toole use to kill people while on road trips across the country. They did this for years. That's why it took so long to catch them"
"947","wait wait wait,every 2 weeks? who's ass did you pull that shit out of? I bet your the typical Eruotrash retard that thinks it's wrong to show patriotism for ones own country because you're ashamed of all the terrible shit yours has done. That or you're french, and that right there is sin Enough. God i wish the allies would have let my people keep control of france, those pieces of shit would be better off speaking Deutsche anyway."
"948","People are ignorant. They act as if Manson went to those boys homes and planned the shooting with them. "
"949","I can remember when the only violence you ever saw in school was an occasional fist fight,,when my niece attended knifes were the weapon of choice. When my youngest daughter attended guns replaced the knifes. Thank God my kids have graduated. "
"950","I saw Manson in a interview with Larry King this summer.  He said he has been blamed for over 30 school shootings thus far. "
"951","It sickens me that not only the columbine shootings aren't the only ones that Marilyn Manson got blamed for. I don't know how many times I wanted to stand up and say that it wasn't his fault for anyone doing such horrible things. People need someone to point a finger at and maybe he was an easy target but people close to those boys said that they never listened to Manson's music! From what I have seen, that man seems to be a very intellegent and kind hearted artist, people are just ignorrent"
"952","It doesn't matter what the gun laws are, because criminals are criminals and will get them anyways. So why make it harder for law abiding people to acquire a gun legally? Answer that, you simple minded fuck. "
"953","without arms there is no freedom. tell that to the hundreds of millions killed by government. You have no soul."
"954","if it was liberals with guns then maybe your right."
"955","they had alot of crime increases. Now australia does not have mass killings but they are still grabbin more guns because thats what government does."
"956","These events remind us of why gun control laws don't work. What did most of them do when they got caught? They shot themselves. Why? Because their fantasy of mowing down sheep got cut short. They don't want a fight, so when someone shoots back they cower like the scum they are. I'd bet money all of these would have drastically lower death tolls if someone had a gun on them when the first shot rang out."
"957","Utter bullshit"
"958","What I find amusing is that the kids responsible for Columbine didn't even like Mansons music. I know many will disagree with me but here goes. There's a thing called personal responsibility. Those Columbine kids chose to pick up those weapons and kill those students/teachers. I don't doubt that they were bullied,,many are,,I have been  bullied.,,but we didn't go buy a gun and wipe people out over it. This was not some sudden incident that happened,,they spent a year planning this out,,"
"959","Then you just have criminals with guns. Idiot, join us in the real world."
"960","The U.S. is physically larger than probably any other country.  Our sheer size causes us to have more crimes, since we have more area."
"961","You're beyond retarded, most guns criminals use are smuggled in and un registered "
"962","but then what about the knives?"
"963","""More guns less crimes"" no no no it becomes fucking chaos"
"964","thats what happens when you bully people.."
"965","Ban Guns = Fixed"
"966","LOL @ FOX ""News."" Terrible music choice. What the fuck were they... Oh. Sorry. FOX ""News"" does NOT think. Funny how they worked in the lone victim of a mass shooting that didn't want stricter gun laws. Now that's the very paradigm of unbalanced."
"967","This is why Canada exists.."
"968","What Eric said"
"969","im crying right now, and if i was there i would be extremely terrified and just sit there and die. like there is no where out, they are roaming around the halls exploding shit and shooting people. i just cant its very very sad. r.i.p to the ones who were murdered.  god bless you all."
"970","Yes, but more of them have occurred in the US"
"971","I don't think the majority understands mass shootings. There is no motive. They just go and kill people because it's what they like. The same way a person naturally needs to eat. A mass shooter needs to shoot. "
"972","since when are americans gonna learn GUN CONTROL get the message"
"973","Another Fool.  READ SHIT.

""Mass killers target Americans once every two weeks on average, in attacks that range from robberies to horrific public shooting sprees like the massacre Friday of 27 people in Newtown, Conn., a USA TODAY examination found.  Using news accounts and FBI records from 2006 through 2010, the most recent years for which complete records were available, USA TODAY identified 156 murders that met the FBI definitions of mass killings, where four or more people were killed.""  "
"974","I live in the UK & I can assure you there isn't anywhere near as much gun crimes"
"975","Dumb American gun lover"
"976","all of these people are not criminals they are just dumb.

a true criminal mastermind will only kill those who deserve it and make money at it.he also always has a getaway plan and a backup getaway plan.

no body no murder.
money appears to be destroyed they arent looking for it.
think your dead they arent looking for you.

cleaner once got asked after the job where is she?- wheres who?"
"977","fuck I'm sick of people saying Guns don't kill people. People Kill People Bullshit.
It's the method That's like saying Knifes Don't kill people You can't compare a gun to a item That can't be used to kill people it's a stupid Debate I have ever heard and I can't believe People use it as a debate.
Guns Knifes are a Method To harm and Kill another Not Spoons Or forks or Fast food store's you can Compare Fast food to Drugs but not Weapon cos that is a personal Choice."
"978","You are a perfect example of the kind of FOOL I'm talking about.  

The USA has about 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people from guns each year.  Finland on the other hand, has about 3.64 per 100,000.  It's not even close.  

And mass shootings occur in the USA roughly every two weeks.  Compared to Finland or other NORMAL countries....again, it's not even close.

Maybe the US could learn something from Finland?

But whose kidding who, huh Moron?  You won't."
"979","the fact America has enough shootings to do a top 10 infamous mass shootings video just says everything that is fucking wrong with that country if you ask me"
"980","not true. only those countries that the US wont stay out of, such as arab countries for example. Countries like France are just full of ungrateful POS that could never survive without countries like the US or England. "
"981","Additionally, I should mention that I am having trouble following how this conversation relates to the video anymore. "
"982","I'm not sure how much more calm I can get, I've been very collected during our discussion. 

Most of the people burning the American flag are doing so because their culture views the west as evil. These are people who wish to enforce very oppressive rules and customs which involve belittling women and executing people who disagree with them. We, the entire western world, not just America, should be glad they hate us. If they didn't that would mean we were doing something horribly wrong. "
"983","I hope you're trying to be sarcastic. "
"984","Your an idiot that does no research, good for you. Instead, you ignorantly put everything on one nation because of the worlds views on them. Take trip over to finland, a country in which young men are not only forced into military service, but are forced to keep the guns they used in the military for the rest of their lives. The US doesn't force it's citizens to own guns, like several other countries, it's gives it's citizens the option to own guns. BIG difference.

"
"985","They should have just made these places gun free zones. Put a sign up or something jeesh."
"986","spreekillers . biz/ close, but thats not enought :/"
"987","You, sir, are an idiot.
If America had a gun mentality, as soon as someone pulled out a gun to kill many innocent people, someone else would just as soon pull a gun out to stop him. UNFORTUNATELY if an innocent man carries a gun to defend himself, he's harassed and detained by law enforcement, whose JOB is to carry a gun, but NOT to use it. A killer would not carry a gun for defense. He carries it for offense.
You know what's really stupid? Close minded ass hats like yourself."
"988","dude just leave well enough alone and let the guy think what he thinks, even though it's wrong, so shut up and go somewhere else."
"989","I agree but don't agree that Tuscon should be on this list. 6 people isn't a mass shooting, gang shootings take way more life."
"990","Epic words ('I wouldn't say a single word to em', I would listen to what they have to say and that's was no one did"") -  Marilyn Manson"
"991","If guns kill people then spoons make people fat"
"992","What about the Connecticut one. The vt shooter we to m high school tho its fucked up"
"993","the media wants to take it and spin it in to fear because your watching tv, maybe the news or something and they pump you with fear of floods, aids, murder, and then you cut to commercial where their like buy a Ford, or if your breath stinks use Colgate, or if you have acne and don't use Proactive girls won't wanna bang you. It's a campaign of fear and consumption. Its all based on the idea keep everyone afraid and they will consume. In the end it all comes down to that and neglectful parents. "
"994","And even the president at the time was dropping bombs overseas, just like our president was trying to bomb Syria, but yet manson's a bad buy because he sang some rock songs, and whos a bigger influence Marilyn Manson or the president of the United States of America? As much as Manson would love to say him the answer is the president. But heaven forbid if anyone says anything about the president, oh no we cant have that can we? so of course the media is not gonna look at it that way."
"995","LOL.  Nice ""argument"".......Moron."
"996","You won't prove him wrong by calling him stupid and laughing at him."
"997","No, Loker. I am, in fact, not ""retarded."" Road trips do exist, where someone travels across the country. Not everything adds up perfectly, Loker. And I'd appreciate it if you didn't refer to me--or anyone else, for that matter--as retarded. "
"998","Wellthats what I'm saying theres so many irresponsible parents out who neglected to teach their kids right from wrong so when a tragedy like columbine happens they decided to blame someone like Manson who could be the poster boy for fear but that would be the parents fault not manson's. he's an entertainer its what he does its not his fault some kid had a shit parent. "
"999","and what cause is that? oh u must mean the fact that america is the worlds greatest super power sorry man your country fell short its ok though wait its not ok... no room for second place just continue to cry because america is better then u and your country"
"1000","are you kidding some many irresponsible parents out there who should not have kids in the first place need something to blame other then them self's. that is why Manson was involved people never have and never will take responsibility for them self's or their kids if i knew my kid was planning something like this i would beat him unconscious and call the cops and hope he never got out of jail"
"1001","holy is just one of those little kids who wants to piss people off by saying america is garbage dont pay attention to him he just wants the attention"
"1002","not a nation of fools just a nation that can kick the shit out of yours"
"1003","The majority of women I know sleep with a gun next to their beds for protection.They have been trained,so they know exactly how to use a gun. Many of us have to arm ourselves for our own protection. The only other thing I can think of to protect my home and family is to put an electrical fence around my yard. So I don't have a gun mentality,,I'm just trying to protect myself and my family.    "
"1004","Lol WHAT THE FUCK DOES MANSON HAVE TO DO WITH THIS? Smh society is so fucking stupid. This is part of the reason why people think metalheads are evil, satan worshiping assholes who are gonna go shoot up their school. Because all people wanna do is play the blame game rather than open their fucking eyes. ""UH OH, MANSON SAID A NO NO."" I can find more violence in just the news alone than all of Mansons songs combined. "
"1005","its pretty obviously not the gun mentality thats causing it, you idiot."
"1006","There are plenty of powerful handguns and rifles available to use for self defense.,without having to use a weapon like an uzi. I understand self defense because I'm seriously considering buying a gun for this exact purpose.,to protect my family.  I live in an area surrounded by gangbangers,,drug dealers and users,,I have triple locks on every door,,all my windows are sealed shut.,and I have a watchdog. Someone still tried to kick my door in and actually dislodged the frame. Frankly I'm scared."
"1007","I just got off the phone with my daughter who lives in Los Angeles and she made a good point.  Weapons like Uzis,,M-16's,,machine guns,,ect should never have been allowed to be sold on the market.,,there's no reason for anyone to own those types of weapons,,unless they are up to no good. "
"1008","It IS true, at least as of Dec. 12, 2012 when the Washington Post wrote a story about.  Search for THAT and do some learning, Fool.  It's called ""Twelve facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States"".  Since then, the numbers have probably gone UP, as you seem to have another mass shooting each month.

If you're going to say that a ""simple search disproves this""......how about you actually provide some PROOF?  

I have."
"1009","Coz the law is stupid."
"1010","Not true. A simple search disproves this with a list of mass shootings from all over the world that are just as deadly as ones that occur in the US. One of which is on Zero Hedge and you will see the deadliest actually occurred in Norway 2 years ago,

And please do not lump everyone in together and call us all fools when you are passing off biased misinformation."
"1011","Manson REALLY?? Don't blame Manson! It was most likely drugs!"
"1012","Are you that fucking retarded! Yes they can but 3 states at once is illogical."
"1013","What math? People can visit multiple states in one visit"
"1014","The Sandy Hook Shooting occurred only days after this video was uploaded."
"1015","What about the 1986 Post Office shooting that was like the Columbine of workplace shootings?"
"1016","I imagine it's even worse in  Mexico because of all the drug cartel murders that have been going on. "
"1017","I meant to send my reply to GOrdLOrd,,not to you because it plain to see that you know how things really are,,and apparently that he or she does not."
"1018","Only five days after this was sandy hook"
"1019","Many in America distrust the government,,and don't give a shit about the law when it comes to gun control. They certainly are not going to run to the nearest police station and turn their gun in just because a law was passed. They see a gun ban by the US government as means of control and have no intention of allowing it if at all possible. I'm not a gun owner and I don't say it's right,,I'm just saying how it is. A person would have to live here to really understand why this is a hot topic."
"1020","Crazy that nine days after this went up Sandy Hook happened."
"1021","Norway shootings still haunt me more."
"1022","this things happen everyday in mexico 
"
"1023","Yeah...see, gun bans only work for people that obey the law. Do you think that someone who's looking to shoot up a mall or a school gives a shit about the law?"
"1024","maybe if you stupid fucks just banned guns or at least tightened up on gun laws so you cant but ammo at wallmart this kind of shit wouldn't happen"
"1025","Guns dont kill people they just make it easyer."
"1026","I hate how every single murder by a teenager has to be blamed by video games. Yeah, video games are violent, yes SOME murders can be blamed by video games, but holy shit, call of duty and grand theft auto arent the solution when a youth murders. Chances are those kids never even played video games. Maybe they had shit for parents that ruined their youth by putting a lid on their life and putting them through depression. But for fuck sake, video games are not a culprit in youth homicides. shit..."
"1027","People always want an answer to these things. I don't. To me, they just happen. Humans are a dangerous species, and getting rid of guns isn't gonna fix that. "
"1028","This crap should not even be glamorized in the slightest bit!!!!"
"1029","Chicken McNuggets have been responsible for more violence and fighting than any other food in the United States. I think the McNuggets need to be banned by the US government to prevent any more acts of violence. "
"1030","A ban on guns would be totally useless at this point.  Had a law passed early enough it might have been possible. It is too late at this point in time to even be effective.  There are just too many guns available.  "
"1031","This happens more in America than anywhere else on earth.  15 of the worst mass shootings in the last 50 years on earth.........have been in the USA.

Their ""gun mentality"" has made them a nation of fools."
"1032","I find it ironic he was a physiologist "
"1033","Damn, I need some more guns"
"1034","because we are talking about a military trial held within military court rooms. its a different set of rules....sorta. even though it might not make any sense to you you have to look at military standards in the US regarding the presentation of soldiers."
"1035","Edgy."
"1036","I like turtles"
"1037","Ok, I have an idea: Instead of blaming video games, music, and movies for the tragedies, how about we acknowledge that these people were severely screwed up individuals? These shooters obviously had some darkness in them. But don't we all? It's scary to admit that we too are capable of this, which is why everything else under the sun gets blamed. But we need to face facts: They were human, same as us. They just didn't know how to keep themselves and their dark emotions under control."
"1038","Not to make a fight at all, but that Mohammed guy looks like Obama. "
"1039","4:12 and 5:56 - Something look familiar ^.^

"
"1040","This was made before that sadly :("
"1041","no sandy hook I see?
"
"1042","Not at all. You haven't presented anything to support that conclusion. Instead, you've applied your ignorant view to the rest of the world and acted like a preteen child throwing a tantrum when others expressed disagreement. "
"1043","poor taste watchmojo"
"1044","AMERICANS BE PREPARED, MORE OF THESE EVENTS ARE COMING UNTIL U CHANGE YOUR LAWS, UNTIL THEN A LOT OF PPL WILL DIE UNFORTUNATELY "
"1045","jeez man I get that you hate America, but do it on another video, like most stupidest people in America not a video o innocent people who are dead."
"1046","Guys, I found Wally at 4:06"
"1047","ikr"
"1048","Close, but no. It's a Tec 9. What looks like the stock is actually a sling."
"1049","Wow posted barely before Sandy Hook..."
"1050","Um in the one camera film of the columbine massacre. Was one of the guns a M-3 Grease Gun because it looked like one was it?"
"1051","thanks for the reply."
"1052","You're aware saying it's a fact doesn't make it a fact, right kid? You should avoid holding negative stereotypes about entire groups of people, that's very narrow minded."
"1053","Hell of a timing when you released this... "
"1054","CHicken nuggets can control your mind..."
"1055","you've had 3 this year, latest was the Washington navy shootings."
"1056","That about 3 states each visit. And unless hes loaded then i highly doubt he has been to 47 states."
"1057","Do the math."
"1058","Why couldn't he?"
"1059","Damn! We never get that many. Mass indicates that over at least 10 people were killed and injured. We only have about 2 mass shootings every 3 years."
"1060","How have you been here 17 times and been to 47 states?"
"1061","Stopping ALL organized crime is pretty much impossible. Organized crime is going to make use of the black market for guns, and they will get a hold of guns if they are legal or not. By making guns illegal and very hard to obtain; what you prevent is random small time criminals from carrying and shooting out of panic. Alot of serious crimes will become minor crimes because guns will not be available."
"1062","That's quite the generalization you've got there. "
"1063","it's true, there's all this commotion going on about weather or not there should be any gun laws or not...However, if you look at other countries-- most shootings happen in the U.S. ... unfortunately.. I feel like making guns illegal makes people get them more.."
"1064","You know Its thing like this that angers me that the death penalty was removed in various states, meaning that those who do mass killings and are caught will live ""comfortably"" in a jail cell with my tax money. What the hell happen to an eye for an eye? You take a life you end your life, not counting war. I really wish we still had the medieval way of torture."
"1065","1:40 Wasn't that in 2002? Why is there an Obama/Romney poll on the bottom?"
"1066"," was thinking this exact same thing. seriously, wtf? "
"1067","why would a trial be delayed because the accused refused to shave his beard, religious reasons or not?"
"1068","That's hilarious I mean really not all Americans are bad and most Americans aren't what you would usually expect them to be. Which is why I'm going to say to please don't say that again because it is untrue. "
"1069","I was born a day after the columbine massacre"
"1070","your mad because your on your period."
"1071","damn mcnuggets"
"1072","You do realize this is their opinion......"
"1073","My birthday will forever be immortalized by a murderous rampage. Yay."
"1074","See the thing is when the constitution was written I don't thing anybody who signed it were expecting firearms that shot 900rpm"
"1075","Really Mojo? How was Columbine worse than Virginia Tech? How was Tuscon worse than The County Massacre? "
"1076","Can't spell sorry"
"1077","Not really, people are REALLY attached to their guns. First off, anyone who wants a gun will just black market that shit on the grounds the Government is overstepping it's grounds. Second, in the US there isn't a gun registry, so there's no way of keeping people who currently have weapons accountable to giving them up when they're illegal, so most will either keep them or put them on the black market. Banning guns is bad, restricting where they can be sold is very different. And good."
"1078","Banning guns will make the Black market Bigger? Still safer than any idiot going  into a gun store buying guys like groceries anywhere and everywhere. Yes we all know guns dont kill people and its the user. But America is full of retards. So the only thing left to do is Ban them guns."
"1079","Most mass shootings are actually planned out. Most random killing are, yes, in the heat of the moment. I think that the later killings would just become death by kitchen knife, or the nearest blunt object. "
"1080","Wowowowowowow. You don't think the 'person' is effected by the abundance of guns around them? Please take into account the psychological impact guns have, and do research. The problem is not as simple as that. "
"1081","I disagree. In every single pro-gun argument I've come across, not one person takes into account the psychological impact having guns around in general has on people...MAJORITY of shootings in America are 'in the heat of the moment' sort of things. YES people will still buy guns, YES people will still get shot...the point is though, A LOT LESS. You must look at other countries in comparison. The gun culture is different and less abundant - less shootings. simple. "
"1082","You're just mad because all you have is a machete."
"1083","What the hell is a ""carm""?"
"1084","I don't get it. I live in Australia and I reckon if people in America just banned guns then there would be no massacres! The only really deadly weapons in Australia are pistols and bows and arrows, and you can't take those in public unless you are a police officer where you can only carry a pistol."
"1085","It's not the weapon it's the person, if u have a gun laying on a table is it gonna aim at me by itself and shoot me? fuck no It's people that are killing each other and u can't ban people so people will die no matter what."
"1086","I think Manson is a piece of fucking work, but that quote at the end really touched me. I don't often get chills from quotes, but ja feels Manson, ja feels."

"1092","Actually the Sears where he bought at least one of the guns is still in existence here in Austin TX, I've been in it. "
"1093","I think banning guns sounds dumb. I mean, they should be more protective about who gets to use guns, but Not everyone is a crazy person. "
"1094","it explains about that in the description. this video was filmed a week before it happened "
"1095","I believe everyone should own at least some kind of firearm. Its has already become so far to start 'banning' guns, that now you need it to become safer. "
"1096","Guns are banned in Ireland where I live and yes there's knife crime but nowhere near the extent  of gun violence. If you live in a place where someone can easily get guns then clearly there's something wrong gun free or not"
"1097","what about the Sandy Hook shooting"
"1098","You don't have to ban weapons. Just do criminal record checks. If someone has shot and killed someone before, don't let him buy a gun. If someone has robbed someone else at gunpoint before, don't let him buy a gun. It's that simple. Of course you can't prevent everyone from buying guns but it's better to do something than nothing."
"1099","That's also in a different country, with different culture, different crime rates, etc. America has so many guns that banning them would simply create an extensive black market. The opposite is Japan, they never had the right to bear arms, so when they banned guns, the black market was/is relatively small. Again, until you've worked with black market people, it's hard to know how easily they can get things. They can buy/sell ANYTHING."
"1100","prob not too many smart ass. they would of been lost in gunfire and he would of had more bullets from your gun to shoot more people. the kid was on a gta san andreas type rampage the adrenaline u have doing something like that. tops anybody around"
"1101","Instead of banning guns, just ban the amount of ammo sold."
"1102","Glad you're alright."

"1111","The problem is banning weapons does nothing. Weed is illegal in most states but you can still easily order seeds online. There's already a black market for guns, banning more would just make it bigger. Just like the drug war and alcohol prohibition it won't work. Banning Semi-Auto is also a horrible idea cause nearly ALL guns are semi-auto. The only things that wouldn't be banned are high powered rifles. If you haven't done illegal things it's hard to get but banning things does nothing."
"1112","Not to mention Fort Hood, also."
"1113","what the hell is wrong with America

"1118","ind of hard too stop 1 in 17 americans from snapping in too psychotic rage."
"1119","In Australia, John Howard banned automatic and semi-automatic weapons in 1996.  This may have changed in the last couple of years, but in the years that follow the number of gun-related deaths dropped every year.  That being said, I agree with what you're saying in regards to people - we have normalised violence and death at the same time as making weapons of death more accessible and effective.  What happens now, I don't know."

"1126","Where I live automatic firearms have been banned since 1972, since then deaths by automatic firearms have increased 6%. There are many other examples of this like double background checks, 3 reference requirement, and clip capacity restrictions, all do nothing. The number of mass shootings has nothing to do with the guns, and everything to do with the people. In the end somebody has to choose to pull the trigger, it's that person we need to stop."
"1127","why am I not surprised that all of these events happened in the U.S.?"
"1128","Sorry if I didn't make that clear. But year, I meant Charles Whitman. I could be wrong, but I understood that he actually went INTO a Sears store here and bought the gun. "
"1129","yeah but how many multiple stabbings do you see? Point is you cant argue for against something by stating that those things cause problems where they are not legal. If anything this should re-enforce the idea that guns should be everywhere because it's better to have 8 attempted shootings with 2 casualties (one being the gunman) than have 1 shooting against unarmed that results in 15 deaths"
"1130","That shouldn't matter. It's the opinion that counts..."
"1131","killer: I don't like these chicken nuggets, they taste beffy. I'm going to kill people for it.

"1148","BTW, the UT shooting was the summer of 66. Austin was a reality small town (not like today). In '66 something like this was unheard of, so the police had no way to cope, like they do now. It looked like a war zone. As far as Charles brain tumor, I think the doctors were split on that. But if you go to UT, nobody remembers the victims or the kids who risked their lives to help the wounded/killed. But everybody can tell you who Charlie was. That's sad. "

"1158","I am not assuming. Its true. Its obvious."
"1159","That sentence is just proof that you shouldn't judge someone by their appearance alone.   "

"1172","Then why is it working EVERYWHERE except in the US? Tyrants? Wasn't the USA the country of democracy, freedom and individualism? The thing that will happen next is that in some way or another the US government will get into a military conflict with Syria or some middle-eastern country.

Dylan was liked, but not popular, his motive is still a mystery, but nonetheless, the moral of the story is be careful who you pick on because they might just put a bullet through your skull"
"1175","the problem is that America is too far deep into the use use of guns. making it illegal just isn't practical anymore since it would be too easy to illegally sell guns. It would have been better if america had illegalized weapons before it was too late like canada did. In other words america doesn't have a big enough blanket to smother this fire."

"1180"," there was no such thing as kids bringing guns to school and murdering their classmates and teachers... I have wonderful memories of my school years and it really terrifies me to think my kids will have to live in fear of another Columbine or Sandy Hook... which is why I'm seriously considering other options besides public or even private schools. It saddens me to think of how much more... I don't know, ""innocent"" we were 20-25 years ago... I really took all that for granted. :("

"1191","I flipped off my own computer screen when they said that."
"1192","True yeah, but I wouldn't say that since two of the shooters mentioned were black."

"1201","A mugger doesn't know before hand what ready condition the victims gun is in! All they would know is that their victim might kill them first! Someone that would shoot a cop during a traffic stop probably has a gun already, legal or not. The Feds just want all guns eventually so they can have total control over us. That way they can tell us when to eat, when to sleep, when to piss etc.! The economy will collapse in the near future, The Feds don't want any self reliant gun owners on the loose!"
"1202","Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold both had problems. One was depressed and one was crazy. I think that's it. But it had nothing to do with video games."
"1203","I agree, if armed soldiers came to the US they will kill the people who pose as a threat. For some reason the government is allowing people to buy these guns, they won't change or remove the Amendment unless someone stupid tries to have a mass shooting on the Department of Defense or a major place, but they will still keep it, in conclusion I think that we should have better security, because people die every year because of gangs,and crazy people, which is sad. WHERE ARE THE AUTHORITEIS, "
"1204","i personally disagree,lets give an example, lets say that all people over the age of 21 had a gun on them. now, lets say someone is being mugged at gunpoint,yes they have a gun on them, but, it is probably concealed and has the safety on, the man mugging him does not, he has it out and cocked,if you tried reaching for your gun you would be shot dead. next, say a man is pulled over by a cop,but wait,he has a gun,a sheriff would have to take extra precautions just trying to give a speeding ticket."
"1205","ah typical retard americans, you have the worst death by gun rate and still."
"1206","Proof asshole?"
"1207","No offense, but that is one stupid Amendment then. Instead of getting a governement / system that works your country prefers everyone having assault rifles? It doesn't even make sense! Even with a gun you still don't stand a chance against trained soldiers. And this is the 21st century for crissake, not the 18th century."
"1208","black people kill more but its never talked about much because everybody accepts it. retard"
"1209","white people are crazy"
"1210","Its a pretty simple answer. If more people conceal carry, the thugs are going to have to think twice about who they are going to Rape, Car jack, Murder, Cause physical harm, or whose home their going to try to invade. Its like letting criminals play Russian Roulette with their own lives at stake. Cause they know they ll be more than likely shot dead in the street if they try some stupid ass shit."

FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS- MOLON LABE III%- COME AND TAKE!- DONT TREAD ON ME!"
"1222","thats america,her husband killed loads of innocent people because he ate to many Mcnuggets.fuck im happpy im not american,lmfao."
"1223","Those kids used to be innocent, their actions are terrible but more guns being the solution?! It won't prevent these shootings, it will allow kids to get their hands on guns easier and do these sort of things."
"1224","Doesn't matter? Their point was that how easy it is for a kid to get his hands on a Tech-9 submachine gun. Pro-gun people said that they want guns for self-defense and hunting. But I don't think an m16 assault rifle with drum mags counts as a ""necessary self-defense / hunting weapon"". Personally I think gun laws should be adjusted so that civilians are only allowed to have: pump-shotguns, hunting rifles and pistols. Those are perfectly fine for either situation."
"1225","So does your ability to speak."
"1226","why? just let everyone roam the streets with a gun? that sounds pretty stupid to me."
"1227","Fuck the NRA. Our teacher in English class was showing a sort off compilation/movie about how everything is blamed for the school shooting except guns. Columbine for instance, the NRA even went to Columbine after the shooting to promote guns! Marilyn Manson got it figured out pretty well.

"1244","so the evidence supports the fact that it is more of a mental illness chemical imbalance some people are capable of murder its been that way forever and its never going to change we are a flawed race living in a flawed world"
"1245","It would be like saying these kids brushed there teeth so therefore brushing your teeth leads to mass murders. If violent negative movies affected these kids to do that then I would say that they were capable of it the whole time. They have violent video games movies and music games ones that we do all over the world in countries that to do not have these problems "
"1246","Do blame movies and video games and music is ridiculous considering millions if not billions do all those things and the fraction of the people that do and go out and commit these crimes is less than one percent if you were conducting an experiment that would be considered a statistically anomaly or an outlier"

"1253","And I won't shoot up my town either. Things like bullying, death in war, rape or sth like that changes personalities. Not movies.. and the reason why they were running wild is bullying.

''You made me what I am. You added to the rage.''-Dylan Klebold
Do me a favor, read ''No easy answers'' by Brooks B."
"1254","Ok, Columbine didn't happen because of fucking NBK or Marilyn Manson or whatever they told. That's crazy. I mean, when you think really deep.... who makes these brutal movies and music? Society, humans, people.. people like you and me. And why do they make this? Because people want this. They want this before Columbine, Kip Kinkel, James Holmes and so on. Bullying changed the personality of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.. not movies. I like NBK, Kurt Cobain & I'm really interestes in crime scene"

"1332","By definition the D.C. Sniper was not a ""mass shooting"". A ""mass shooting"" is the shooting of 4 or more victims at ONE location on a SINGLE occasion. The D.C. case was a ""serial shooting/murder"" which is the shooting/killing of several victims in 3 or more separate incidents over weeks, months, or years. Then there is the third type ""shooting/murder spree"" which is shootings/murders at 2 or more locations with almost no time between the shootings/murders."

I feel like the media doesn't understand how to treat children of such tragedy. We wanted answers, they wanted answers, so they took what students said and passed it off as news. I feel like that's what happens"
"1342","I feel pretty good knowing I have a tool to defend myself and my family should some nut job break in, with or without a gun, and intend to do harm to me or my family.

If you have a bunch of gang members with extreme poverty, the laws dont fucking matter, because the gangs still get their guns anyway.
So if we get rid of gangs, you only have mass shootings and some disputes. I wonder how much that would be nationwide."
"1372","True as that is, the ones in this list don't really fit that motive so much. I wouldn't consider it a digital age phenomenon. Obviously for those who are wanting exposure, sure. But again the Austin sniper was way before the digital age. I just don't think it's as generalizable as that..."
"1373","that is not the difference, there are no facts to support your lame ass hypothesis, chicago tried to regulate guns because of a pre existing violence, the ban of handguns, (which has been repealed by the right wing court), had nothing to do with a rise in crime.

both chicago and d.c. were saturated by bordering states who became their gun suppliers, cites have successfully sued states like virginia for being arms sellers of big cities.

read something besides nra propaganda, you look stupid."
"1374","wrong again bob, the columbine kids got their guns at a gun show with a straw purchaser, they weren't old enough to buy them themselves.  your story about a dealer turning them down is bullshit.

and what do you care if they were purchased legally or not?  everyone of you clowns fight all regulations or measures to make guns harder to get, this is exactly what you want.  I mean don't more guns make us all safer?"
"1375","Mass shootings are a digital age phenomenon. Becoming infamous and remembered is a common reason among many. That is a fact. Look up the bio's on many of the shooters becoming infamous is usually a factor. Is it the only reason? Of course not. "

"1378","There was an asian in there two. and these are just 10 shootings. so no. not only white people."
"1379","Let me do a quick research:
Chicago had 532 murders in 2012, 80% gang related.
Seattle had 26 murders in 2012, I'd say these are crime or gang related too.

Both are major cities. The difference is, you can open carry guns without a license in Seattle and get a conceal carry license.
In Chicago, guns are completely prohibited. Gang still carry em.
All those murders in the stats also count the gang murders. You dont even wanna know how much it adds up when you put philly and DC to it"
"1380","That's not necessarily true. Mass shootings don't all have the same motivations. If you watch this video, you'll see the differences. The Austin sniper had a brain tumor that was likely the cause of his rage. The ""Joker""'s motive is still ""unknown"" and there's lots of conspiracy theories. It's important to be aware and not just generalise criminals as attention seekers. Understanding these tragedies can help prevent them in the future. "

People wouldn't need guns to protect themselves if the criminals/pyschos/etc didn't have guns in the first place. Countries like the UK and Germany have low gun crime due to very restrictive laws meaning that it is hard to own a gun. However murder is still there-but theres no gun involved.  "

"1440","because then the world is defenceless,
no matter how hard you try, guns will exist, and people will use them.
In Sweden, it is a requirement to own a gun after a certain age.

"1446","That's the problem though, protecting yourself against what?

I've never thought EVER that I would need a gun to protect myself.. Why? Because there basically all LITTLE TO NO guns on the streets of where I live in the UK.

"1457","Yeah, there's definitely such a thing as a law-abiding criminal."
"1458","In Australia after the Martin Bryant mass shooting guns were banned throughout Australia. There hasn't been a mass shooting here since.

America needs to do the same."
"1459","So the other %99.99 of legal gun owners that are not crazy can be defenseless too?  You can be one of them.  If you have not realized yet criminals do not follow the law."
"1460","????? The criminals won't turn in their guns. If you have an outright gun ban the only ones that will have guns will be the criminals. Look into it. All of the cities in the US that have a high amount of gun control are also the cities with the highest amounts of gun violence. Gun control does not take the guns out of the hands of criminals. It only helps them by disarming their victims. Plus if you read history, disarming the general population is one of the first steps towards a dictatorship."
"1461","That's kind of my point. These people can't fight back because they do not have guns themselves. That's why states like mine have concealed carry laws."

If someone goes on a mass killing spree, they get rewarded by free room and board, free food. If someone is on death row, how much money does it cost to take them out back and shoot them? Don't feel remorse for somebody who's a serial killer. So when the dude gets 6 life sentences,the US taxpayers are paying to keep him alive and feed him"
"1481","Not really, in order to legal own a gun in the US, you have to get a permit and get registered and all that. But now, our government is trying to take away our guns. Just so when, the government tries to take over their own citizens, we have no way of protecting ourselves. This whole world is going to shit"

"1485","I wasn't replying to you so that's why you don't know what I'm talking about. The guy is saying only America has mass murders cause we have guns, there are still mass murders everywhere. And there is a top ten list of shootings outside the U.S. too."
"1486","ok. Bro you gotta watch the wording."
"1487","Why did one of them have to happen on my birthday?"
"1488","That was in China, this is talking about the US.  That happened in on December 14, (the same day as Sandy Hook), this video was uploaded December 5; which is also why SH isn't on the list."

"1504","funny how all of these mass shootings happen in America?"
"1505","i'm very shocked that virgina tech massacre was #2 i would call it #1, on body count alone! you just made columbine famous for your own purposes is all. just like you made charles manson famous."
"1506","Only in America..."
"1507","Marilyn Manson = Instant Respect!"
"1508","You are correct,Manson's wisdom is rare, in that not too many other people have it."
"1509","Amen to that. That is the one reason why I dont support the NRA. They defend the second amendment by attacking first. You either defend the constitution or you don't."

"1530","Check again..."
"1531","Why it's easier to buy an assault than to vote, in one demographic. Sums it up quite well. "
"1532","That's 'Merica!"
"1533","You're right, not going to disagree.  Most weapons used in killings are either stolen or obtained through a black market (For a lack of a more appropriate term) anyway.  Besides, it's been shown that cities with the strictest gun laws usually have the highest violent crime rates.  The UK is the best example as of how taking guns away is one of the worst things you can do.  "
"1534","Taking the guns is favored by people because its the easy way out that doesn't require any actual work or compassion. Manson is right, if people had actually listened to these people and treated them like humans, things would have been different, but I guess your all too busy to be bothered with that right?"
"1535","All of these shooters had serous emotional problems, if you people care about human life as much as you want people to think you do, then rather than take their guns, you should reach out to them and try to help the people you know in your life. We live in a society and are supposed to take care of each other, if your not taking care of each other, then your part of the cause for these events. If these people were cared for, they wouldn't have done those things."
"1536","Using torture tactics to commit suicide."
"1537","American stupidity at it's finest.  US government and society turning people into murderers."
"1538","I don't like Marilyn Manson but what he said at the end was 100 percent true."
"1539","Oops, I didn't see that. And yeah, its fact now that Sandy Hook was staged. "
"1540","well its actually 100% if you go after the video. "
"1541","Lol, 10, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 don't represent us. Also the percent of blacks in the US is 13.1% so having approx. 1 spot in this top 10 is statistically normal."
"1542","Yea, so many ears, I feel like I can hear everything."
"1543","Yes but the US had 14x the amount of people compared to Australia. Also, suicide by guns are a large portion, 6 of every 10 gun deaths are suicide. Furthermore, just because Australia has fewer guns does not mean murder rates went down(firearm murders went down 10%, murder in general went up 10%). Assault, Robbery, Murder and Rape since the ban have gone up at least 5% and as much as 15-20%. Reported sexual assaults have increased by 51 percent since 1995."
"1544","Those are the people we have to keep guns out of the hands of, not the average person. Most of these casualties would have been mitigated if at least one person had a concealed pistol for personal defense. In the case of the Texas Diner, the woman in the video had left her weapon in her glove box due to state law banning concealed weapons, and because of that 24 people including both of her parents were killed. I sound like a Right wing Republican, but I only believe in what may be able to help."
"1545","Probably its ""Popularity."""

"1547","When it happens outside of the US no one bats an eye"
"1548","I hate that the Sandy Hook shooting took place on my birthday! I hate evil people! :("
"1549","Well that's a bad situation all around. In order to use a firearm correctly, you must be either well trained or simply don't give a fuck. A lot of people own guns for the ""sense of security"" however it's not the gun that provides the security, it's the operator of that gun. Why do you think the Military and Law enforcement train so often? In a tense and unpredictable situation you must overcome fear and take control. A lot of gun owners can't do that, and thus bring more pain upon themselves."
"1550","This video was made before the Sandy Hook shooting took place."

"1558","remember Marilyn Mansons when considering the gun debate about any shooting. "
"1559","So now tell my why 90% of these shootings happen in america. Maybe its really mcdonalds... "
"1560","1:30 with the snipers they all think we r the worst people in the world to say that we r racist when we say black people mostly do shootings (and i don't believe that) but its not helping when black people do FUCKING SHOOTINGS they say we r bad for being racist but they make it true! "
"1561","Assuming you have the time you have the time to arm yourself and shoot them before they shoot you. As well as the fact a large amount of people killed are shot in the back so don't see it coming.
In the uk not even the police have guns and unsurprisingly very few people get shot and Mass shootings are pretty much unheard of. "
"1562","Found Waldo 4:07"
"1563","Sandy Hook wasn't on this list because it didn't happen yet, check your dates yo. Saying Sandy Hook was staged is ignorant.  "
"1564","Actually if someone were in my house with a gun I would prefer a close combat weapon, a baseball bat would be my weapon of choice.  You don't need to reload a baseball bat. :)"
"1565","Sandy Hook wasn't on this list because it was staged."
"1566","Rate of gun deaths in Australia have halved since the 1996 gun law reforms."
"1567","Thats ridiculous, America has one of the highest rates of shootings in the world, purely because of how easily available guns are to the public. I live in Australia, where there are very strict gun laws. Despite the fact that these ""criminals can get guns however they want"", there was only 236 deaths by guns in 2010, compared to America's 9595 deaths. Good thing they all had guns to protect themselves with though..."
"1568","america...this is all what i have to say about that"
"1569","Just goes to show how fucked up some people can be, ""That chicken nugget caused my husband's psychosis"".  Really?  "
"1570","To clear things up for people saying gun laws would fix everything, It would help a little, but weapons would get smuggled over here from other countries that make arms and people would illegally buy them. How do you think people from other countries that don't manufacture weapons get them? Making a law would make these things happen less, but all because we have a law doesn't mean there is a fool who will break it..."
"1571"," That's like saying you should stop the birth of any future female if you were against prostitution. Having the equipment to be something horrible doesn't make you one. I understand your anger, but you can't blame guns on this. The problem lies in an individuals mind on whether to make the right choice or not, and those people obviously don't have a normal filter working up there. 
 "
"1572","its 50/50 on how everyone answers to that debate it sounds extremely stupid but is logical"
"1573","Maybe you should listen to him more often."
"1574","wow these shootings are getting worse every year why wont they just SHUT DOWN EVERY GUN SHOP IN THE US THIS IS GETTING RIDICULUS >:("
"1575","i don't think gun nuts need extra incentive to do what they do"

"1578","It's the only fucking country you can buy weapons at supermarkets in . "
"1579","there should not even have a list for this its just making the shoots feal like gods or something"
"1580","Shut the fuck up. This is why guns SHOULD be legal."
"1581","eary isnt it?"
"1582","#8 doesn't represent us"
"1583","I'm curious why we glamorize mass shootings like this; making a top ten video. While it might be argued that this does nothing to further the frequency of tragedies such as these, I argue that it actually may lead to a sense of competition among those planning on executing such acts. 

I'm not in the argument of gun control, nor am I an authority on American law, but I really think that the continued focus on the shootings, and the ranking of such, is a detriment to stopping further violence."
"1584","Why guns should be illegal"
"1585","it is you who has no clue, ever heard of the gun show loop hole?  it's where the kids who did the columbine shootings got their guns, thru a strawman purchaser, and all legally.

america has the most guns and 80% of the western worlds gun deaths, more gun deaths in america than all of europe and japan combined, and that's three times as many people.

facts and gun propaganda don't mix."
"1586","reporters shouldn't even be making these montage like videos that give these sickos some sense of competition and pretty much serve as a challenge to any other confused fucked up gun nut that wants to crack one of these lists."
"1587","why you mad bro?"
"1588","You had one job. "
"1589","Because I said in my last post that the U.S. is the only place you can get guns right?

Last time I checked that's 0% true."
"1590","Relax friend. No need to have your jimmies rustled."
"1591","No no no, it's not an argument, it's not even a discussion. Go do it, hurry up. Even someone as stupid as you can't screw that up. Like seriously not even joking dude. Stop reading this and go do it. "
"1592","If I was half as stupid as you look in your picture I would have done so already"
"1593","Except for the fact you're not going to be able to buy a truckload of guns anywhere inside the US unless you have a license to manufacture and distribute.

You have to have a license to operate a firearm. You have to have a license to conceal a weapon.

You obviously have no clue what you're talking about."
"1594","who the fuck says gee whiz?"
"1595","uh yeah, the only country were you can get a trunk load of guns without registration, license, or how about a check to see if you're the actual person buying the gun?

gee, you need a license to fish and drive a car but lethal weapons?  nah, what would be the point in that?

america has the most guns and america has the most gun violence, gee whiz didn't see that coming."
"1596","I live in the beltway lol #8"

"1599","first off most the shooters have been proven to be mentaly unstable. an most of them do not own the guns. just stole them intead. pasides. have yall even shot a 9mm pistol at a can on the other side of a river i mean come on."

"1613","Last I checked, you actually need a license to use military-grade weapons such as an M16 and M4 which are full auto."

"1619","Pretty sure it's the only place where you can buy them at Wall Mart."
"1620","Uh.

Anybody ANYWHERE may not know how to use a gun. And last I checked, most of these people where adept in the gun skill.

Your comment is just stupid."
"1621","Lets be real. While gun accessibility is part of the issue, the main problem is the fact that the US is a shit hole. If I lived there I'd have a gun for protection. Now we all know tragic and unexpected violence happens everywhere, but any country one lives in where the average citizen feels compelled to have a firearm to feel safe is not particularly a desirable place to live."
"1622","He's not saying it's the only country you can get guns in. But still, giving Americans guns is very wrong, since some of them don't even know how to use one."

Why is this not on the list?"
"1629","planed to use guns to cause anarchy ????? VIOLANCE AND CHAOS DOESN'T MEAN ANARCHY ! "

"1699","So it is okay for a citizen to arm themselves. I do however believe in background checks being enforced ANYWHERE you buy a gun. Eric and Dylan bought guns at a gun show while Eric and Dylan were arrested for breaking into a van, were being investigated for their threats online, and Eric took meds. A simple check would have made the sale a big fucking NO t either of them. No one is going to take your guns away and even if they did... you're not going up against an entire military."
"1700","As in communities would have to organize themselves and have plans readily available in which a crisis would occur where they could form together and fight back. The militia part was enforced mainly because they didn't want people randomly shooting.

First, the founding fathers knew technology would progress which is why they stated Americans had the right to be as well equipped as their military. (Why? Because the British Empire.. that's why) However, high-tech projectiles as in missiles..etc. were most likely beyond the imagination of our forefathers. 
Secondly, the citizens allowed to be armed had to first be part of an organized militia. (cont.)"
"1702","that last part was fucking true."
"1703","People have such weak mental fortitude...."
"1704","Shut the fuck up."

"1706","Its not the guns that kill people its the person who is holding the gun that kills people...think about that...and america blames you for thinking that way..."
"1707","This is what happens when you legalize guns, America, you have only yourself to blame."
"1708","Probably not, but they knew that technology was advancing and that's why they worded the way they did. To make it timeless so that we can always be on a level playing field with those that would oppress no matter how far technology advances. "
"1709","Yea good point but when they wrote the second amendment im sure they couldnt have grasped the idea of the kind of weaponry we have today"
"1710","Aggressive behaviour can be caused by multiple stimuli... for example, in the case of Whitman, the brain tumour was pressing against his Amygdala, the brains center for emotional reactions. However, Whitman had also been abused in his childhood by his father, and trained to use guns and how to kill; which may have also been what caused his shooting. In my opinion, if guns were harder to get a hold of and restricted to some level, it could reduce shootings considerably. "
"1711","Iones do not fall into the gun control position of blaming the gun. Put that blame on the perpetrators and the lamestream media for paying undo attention to these people."
"1712","idiots huh. go ahead and tell that to the ones that were wounded in those shootings dipshit, or better yet try telling that to the families that lost loved ones in those shootings. you may have no damn respect for those people but i do. because just by mentioning these shootings to them hurts them and you know, yet they don't say anything because they know if they did, that you people would tell them to piss off, that you can do what you want with youtube channel and footage of the shooting."
"1713","thats fals slicktrickz because if nobody had gun there would be no shooting"
"1714","Sandy Hook was a false flag anyway."
"1715","banning guns increases crime. Is it really any coincidence that worst areas with gun related crimes are in gun free zones? Let that sink in."
"1716","I wouldn't Say A Single Word To Them I Would Listen To What They Had To Say Because That's What No One Did ....... [[Marilyn Manson]]"
"1717","when people say that the shootings are the fault of games, i think it is the fault of the parents who buy the games to their kids and dont explain them that it is a videogame not real life"
"1718","Tere's more shootings to come. Its a safe to predict every month there will be at least 1 in the US of fucking A! Unless the government bans guns the killing wont stop! Dumbasses!"
"1719","Hey massmureders lets make a top 10 -__-"
"1720","They haven't made a list to give them any positive attention, they have done it to show how awful they all are. Stop being so easily offended and trying to take the moral high ground. All the shootings where tragic and people like you that say how awful it is to mention them are idiots."
"1721","Yeah blame violent video games like always >:( there is no proof"
"1722","and yet they make a countdown of them as if they being awared unwanted and unneeded attention. they know better than this."
"1723","SANDY HOOK??
"
"1724","A lot of these r in Texas"
"1725","This is probably going to sound ridiculous but why are kids like in the columbine massacer have such easy access to guns?"
"1726","it would all stop"
"1727","Where do you live?
"
"1728","I am so glad i don't live in America!!!!"
"1729","texas."
"1730","I just hate how some Christians make other people think that All Christians are dumb like him.. Same with Atheists.. Couple of dumb Atheists start writing sh*t about other religions and they make All Atheists look like deuches.."
"1731","Marilyn Manson said we need to listen to kids?   How about raising them right?  This was symptomatic of a godless culture and neglectful parenting"
"1732","Words are the most potent thing we have at our disposal. They can unite a nation, or bring it to it's knees. Countless people have spent countless nights crying over words and in extreme cases, have taken their own life over words. The wrong words can even push peoples to war. In fact, I'd say that all of the world's problems can be attributed to a lack of communication and the fact that we can never truly understand one another."
"1733","And to end it, crazed manson offers true reason."
"1734","Its sad that events like waco weren't included. Government has killed more people at one time than any American."
"1735","@Salamander Senel Those were during pre-Geneva Protocol times of war. Still VERY wrong."
"1736","So I assume Wounded Knee, Sand Creek and Bloody Island don't count huh? "
"1737","If only more people carried guns"
"1738","This is the longest comment chain ever"
"1739","Do you even know the definition of infamous? Its where something is famous for being extremely bad or evil. So they haven't done anything morally wrong."
"1740","I don't like marlyn Manson as a music artist but those words you say at the end of this video is so true"
"1741","why does everyone act like the amendments are infallible? I think its important for them to be questioned."
"1742","Was this put up after sandy hook"
"1743","watchmojo, do we really need this? really? these shootouts are not infamous, thier goddamn horrific and are bad reflections of humanity.  we don't much for these bad things anymore, people who experienced these tragedy's have nightmares about them and those who didn't experience them see that as dark visions of other human beings. and most human beings don't even care, none the less it is not something to make a countdown of, and you people should know better than that. "
"1744","Great, so if I can afford it, I'll buy a missile. The difference between arms and words is that arms will become more and more efficient and destructive, while words will always remain harmless."
"1745","Here's the reason: Stop blaming it on video games and music, and starting pointing the fingers at the bullies who make it a living hell for these kids everyday. Those kids who get shot up, well maybe it'll teach you guys a lesson on respect and keep your mouth shut before you say something rude and disrespectful to someone else. "
"1746","4 and 1 are pretty famous"
"1747","wat
"
"1748","They also said it should be revised often, it never has, which is ridiculous. Your argument is completely invalid, not one of these men could fathom the technology available to use and how wide it's application. You also have to take into consideration the context in which these laws were written, the world has changed drastically since then and laws need to change as time goes by. Just because something works once doesn't mean it'll always work."
"1749","can you prove that he isn't?"
"1750","No no no no. You can't say 'by your logic' and then make stuff up that does not correlate at all. ACTUALLY by that logic, new forms of speech wouldn't necessarily by AUTOMATICALLY covered by a document written by people who didn't know about them or their impact. That is not at all the same as not extending to them at all, it just leaves it open to debate.

These were not gods who wrote these things - there's no such thing as timeless. This is why slavery got by them. Nothing timeless there."
"1751","Not ""who"" but what. I don't know and I don't really care but at least I don't believe that some dude created a woman from a man's rib(?)"
"1752","Can you both stop fighting?"
"1753","This was made one week before the Sandy Hook massacre. They explain it in the description (I was wondering the same thing)"
"1754","These are all horrible shootings , But what about sandyhook school massacre
"
"1755","Rocks for sure."
"1756","Hey everyone! click on ""show comment"" to watch toddlers argue!
"
"1757","Because people think they are better than others, and the people who get looked down at cause destruction and homicides. It's mainly the bullies fault because if I saw a kid murder a bully, I'd give him a medal and piss on the bully's body."
"1758","how so? if my attacker come at me with an illegally obtained AK-47 i dont want a musket to defend myself id like something of equal if not greater power to defend myself with"
"1759","back then the enemy had the same type of firearm .... today is an armed intruder or psychopath with an AK-47, AR-15, shotgun or handgun, we as citizens can LEGALLY purchase and use these firearms as well."
"1760","Agreed. Why am I not camping in a corner like I have no knowledge to play a FPS game and shooting people as they come through an entry way? Or having infinite amount of jets to kamikaze into crap or shoot squirt guns thinking I'm shooting Covenant aliens(Not to hate on Halo)I'm getting to nerdy about games but the point is violent games haven't made nearly anyone cause violence...maybe one or two people but not allot. "
"1761","Yes yes it was. It says that in the description."
"1762","yippee.  cant come of out the reality of getting a iphone for doing some questionnaire :) . its not a joke, simply put your email and number and wait for your parcel. have a try and enjoy :)  ==> bit.ly/16hz5mb?=itpzhe"
"1763","The Sandy Hook shooting happened nine days after this video was posted."
"1764","Yes chicken mcnuggets now make u kill people"
"1765","How does, ""Vengance is mine"" mean, ""violence is mine""? Study Biblical lanaguage, Greek word here is, ekdikésis meaning, "" a defense, avenging, vindication, vengeance, (b) full (complete) punishment.""

Basically Judgement, what is Judgement? Death, not violence.

Also revenge isn't a natural reaction, Anxiety/Anger is, which people take the wrong way to hurt others, 

Why would you want to have someone else sad and harmed? you want a person to feel that way?"
"1766","Why blame violent video games? What about all the other kids who play CoD or Battlefield  or Mortal Kombat, and have never been violent ever."
"1767","It is a ""legit"" argument because the founding fathers never had any idea of the forms of media used today. 

Their intent was to keep the average citizen as well armed as the average soldier in order to prevent tyranny."
"1768","Yea but using the 2nd amendment isnt really a legit argument for guns laws because the founding fathers never had any idea of the kind of weapons used today."
"1769","Well, I don't need sleep anyway. "
"1770","This is disgusting. This isn't a music video countdown on MTV. These are peoples lives. And all these mass murders are perpetrated by whites. How come law enforcement doesn't take to the street and stop and frisk white people? Muslim's are not the only people who can be terrorists and they don't pose the ultimate threat to America's security. The ultimate threat is the domestic threat and the color of these people that pose the threat is white. White privilege through and through. "
"1771","y is the usa so fuck't up
"
"1772","Its the HOW we want to bring about change you moron. Youtube comments don't do jack shit. "
"1773","I've not once tried to change the subject. I've more than made my point and you're still not sure what we're talking about. If you don't understand then you never will. I wish you well."
"1774","Obviously this is the attitude we need. People who want change are daydreamers."
"1775","You don't get to say someone's points in a debate are false when you use the same tactics. Rhetoric is required in English classes in the U.S. you ought to study it more extensively. You were probably day-dreaming about how you were going to change the country you live in one YouTube comment at a time. "
"1776","You insist on taking the smallest possible number to make the issue seem small. It's a petty tactic. I blame people for the tragedies. But you're using cheap tricks to change the topic. The topic is gun control vs freedom of speech. Also, you're trying to say mass shootings are the only issue? What about the poor mother of 3 that got killed for her purse because some man bought a gun without a background check. Oh, that's right, you didn't hear about her. Only numbers get their story told."
"1777","Name one gun that can pick itself up and fire itself. Sounds kind of silly, right? But it's the truth. Blame people for those tragedies because people are to blame. 

Thanks for the numbers, even though they're irrelevant to the discussion. I'll make them relevant though. There were 16 mass shootings last year. Lets say there were two guns used per shooting. 32/310,000,000 is a very miniscule fraction. I'd prefer it be zero, but dont' punish the 309,999,968 guns that aren't killing people."
"1778","Ask the families of Sandy Hooks how painful guns are. How painful the second amendment is.

 The Congressional Research Service in 2009 estimated there were 310 million firearms in the United States, not including weapons owned by the military. 114 million of these were handguns, 110 million were rifles, and 86 million were shotguns. In that same year, the Census bureau stated the population of people in America at 305,529,237"
"1779","You list three people. However tragic, you're still comparing to the murder of hundreds upon thousands of people. You're saying if we get rid of guns we have to get rid of words.

You're being incredibly ridiculous. You can turn off a computer, you can close a web page, you can even skip school if you're being bullied, however you cannot stop a bullet simply by closing your eyes.

Your words are insulting. You make light of children, families, innocent people dying, simply because of words?"
"1780","The argument isn't comparing speech to murder. It's about what the bill of rights protects. If you take away any form of arms that didn't exist when the Bill of Rights was written, you have to take away everything that wasn't around when the Bill of Rights. It isn't a hard concept to understand.
If you're still stuck thinking that words or the internet aren't harmful, just ask Amanda Todd, Ryan Halligan, or Tyler Clementi. I'm sure they'll tell you just how painful it can be."
"1781","a few days before the most infamous conneticut shooting"
"1782","It's funny that you argue this, I happen to have the same standpoint as MrHopsinVEVO. By your logic, Speech and Murder are identical.

I'll say it again. MURDER. Loss of life. What exactly are you comparing to here?

And I'll add to the point, you say they wrote the bill of rights to be timeless, it was written in a time of war. It was written to give people the opportunity to defend themselves from foreign armies, and to join militia, neither of which have been on our doorstep for 70ish years."
"1783","he indeed does."
"1784","Only as well as you can prove he does.  Also, what makes you think he's a he?"
"1785","for all the people saying violent video games cause these shootings and crimes, this kind of stuff happened even before video games were first made, and only people who have been tormented into insanity or people who are mentally ill would do something like this"
"1786","It's up to YOU to prove it, if I say that I saw a ghost in the hallway it's up to me to prove it, ""CAN YOU PROVE I DIDN'T SEE A GHOST?! HUH?!?! CAN YOU?!?!"""
"1787","Can you prove God doesn't exist ?"
"1788","......did this really need to be a list? "
"1789","It's your logic, not mine.You said that because something wasn't around when the constitution was written, it shouldn't be protected under it."
"1790","this was befor the sandy hooks but y do they do this
"
"1791","Kent State Massacre? That was the most shocking in recent history."
"1792","Top 10? You really called it a Top 10? Wow"
"1793","These ""people"" strike in gun-free zones and then kill themselves.  Fuckin' cowards."
"1794","That's absolutely terrible logic. Guns and Free Speech have different boundaries. One of them can't massacre a town..."
"1795","You believe in an invisible man."
"1796","would? probably, who knows? I mean how would we ourselves know for sure if he would? Suppose you should have died today the moment you stepped out of your house, but god prevented the event from ever occurring? How would any of us know? Thats why i never make the assumption that god would just step in and stop things all the time, and even if he did how would you know he did it?"
"1797","Alright, I'll bite. When they wrote the first amendment they had no knowledge of radio, television, or the internet where you can instantly and anonymously say whatever they want with no repercussions no matter how vulgar or just plain stupid it is. By your logic, freedom of speech shouldn't extend to any form of media that wasn't available back then. They were smart people and they wrote the bill of rights in a way that would be timeless. They knew technology wouldn't stand still."
"1798","Not every one needs to comment."
"1799","What about h00k?"
"1800","Please provide grounds for your claim."
"1801","Indeed, people fail to understand the concept of faith.
We Trust that he exists because we have felt his presence, not because we saw him or heard him. It's belief without a necessary need for proof, and if somebody proved it, then it wouldn't be quite the same. Furthermore, God's existence cannot be disproved, simply because nobody knows everything that's in the Universe, or other universes. Absence of Evidence is not evidence of absence."
"1802","how do you know it is a work of fiction. plus scientist and researchers find events in the bible have actually happen and some events in which they say happen like the crossing of the red sea can be explain by reasonable science.  so there could be a god and a lot of the bible has been proven by history. all you really have to do is really read what the bible says and look at both science and history and your see they have a lot in common then you think."
"1803","Okay lets get one thing straight, Marilyn Manson  and violent video games had nothing to do with the Columbine shooting."
"1804","The Bible is a work of fiction."
"1805","What total democracy?"
"1806","this is the problem with a total democracy"
"1807","The concept of god is that he is all knowing and all powerful, the problem is that people assume that there is none because there is no proof that they can see when the idea is of faith. One big error ive seen people do is assume that God is within the clouds for example, when it is said that heaven and hell were created prior to the universe, so finding them wont be inside it. At the same time, just because they dont believe in god doesnt mean god doesnt exist. Just be objective about it."
"1808","Gotta be honest here, but there would be guns regardless which means shootings would have happened regardless. That statement of yours is incorrect and has no objective proof of the situation or the potential situation."
"1809","Wow!  You're crazy."
"1810","i am soo sorry you have to go thru all of these horrible places where all these shootings happend did your first sister die at columbine or was it earlier this year? im sorry if i offended you"
"1811","#4 got me so fucking mad"
"1812","I'm sick of that term used to describe god. ""magic"".
It lowers his power to a human level.
God is more like an all-knowing, ever-powerful father to all that exists.
Internet atheists like you make the rest of the atheistic community look bad."
"1813","You've clearly never read the book of Mathew, and if there's no hell, then what's the point in being religious ?
What punishment is there to avoid if there is no hell ?"
"1814","they're too afraid to face what theyve done."
"1815","That makes no sense..."
"1816","But that's how the Bible says the world would become so should we really be surprised? lol"
"1817","Seems like you sure didnt read it."
"1818","Not everything needs to be a top ten."
"1819","I'm guessing you really REALLY don't like religious people no matter the sect, basis, or motive. Is that right?
(I'm just being Curious George!)"
"1820","We have introduced gun laws. They quickly are turned down when they try to reach a national level. The issue right now is massacres aren't enough to justify changing the policies of the mainstream society (of the country) that have been set for quite some time.
However, most didn't sit and do nothing. Gun laws at a local level have been set in place. Food for thought."
"1821","Uh... this is a pretty touchy and questionable top 10 list. I find it a very touchy subject to make a top list out of. I can only imagine how the idea came about.
""Hey guys! Let's list shootings in the US!"""
"1822","My cousin Troy was in Theatre 16 in Aurora during the premier of The Dark Knight Rises. My sister went to Columbine Highschool in Littleton and now my other sister is going to Virginia Tech. My family is apparently a giant magnet for tragic locations,"
"1823","Ranking shootings only perpetuates futher more bloody shootings."
"1824","Don't your type of people do the same thing?"
"1825","we shouldn't need a massacre to make safer gun laws. they should already be in place."
"1826","You believe in atheism stop trying to force it on others."
"1827","Gun laws tell me again how criminals follow the law."
"1828","Fuck you, atheistic virgin shit"
"1829","Thats what psychosis"
"1830","white people "
"1831","Yet America still refuses to introduce proper gun laws"
"1832","Critical thinking. Give it a whirl."
"1833","Your name is Cheezebowl. Doesn't get much more senseless than that?"
"1834","and the list goes on..."
"1835","this was 6 days before the newtown shootings"
"1836","really depends on what god they believe in. it's fair to say that there are people that take Satan as their Godly figure too. "
"1837","I'm more of a ""see it to believe it"" towards god and religion and all that other religious crap..."
"1838","That is true, most children are forced to go to church by their parents. But most kids also reject their religions or kind of move away from them when they grow older, unless their parents are strict about it or they live in a religious community. I've always seen God as a creation of science himself. I really don't see the fact of him creating EVERYTHING like everyone else does. But as an almighty sentient being that happens to have abilities beyond our knowledge or understanding."
"1839","The expansion of a singularity"
"1840","Religion is filth - Educate and populate people! Religion is effectively giving up your right to think; ""Oh, IDK what the answer is therefor it was God"" LMAO what a fucking joke."
"1841","Mr. Cheezebowl you are not winning the argument."
"1842","What glorious victory? the only glorious victory there shall be is when jesus comes back in his glory. And I'm back."
"1843","Facts and common sense okay if you had an ounce of common sense you would know that the big bang theory did not happen that's like thinking you could just be like soccer ball and a soccer ball would come out of nowhere! And brainwashed or insane we believe in the truth. "
"1844","What about the Sikh temple shooting? "
"1845","That's just it you gotta have faith and what makes atheism the right way and religion the wrong way? "
"1846","COLUMBINE!!!!"

Your move."
"1850","Revelation 19:20 And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image.

"1856","What I don't get is why would you even upload a video like this? You think the innocent people that lost their lives want themselves to be on youtube? Disrespectful."
"1857","Insanity = Repetition"
"1858","technically it was eve but yeah you are right."
"1859","If Satan exists shootings would happen."
"1860","your standpoint is very extreme. I""m sure it says in many places in the Bible to also stone your enemy. Are you a utilitarian? "
"1861","read the bible. adam and eve brought sin into this world"
"1862","what about the norway massacre?"
"1863","So now the world is separated between only religious people and atheists? Anyone else is considered an idiot? Judging you from that logic of yours, you seem more like an idiot."
"1864","Well, most shootings can be linked to insanity"
"1865","LOL"
"1866","Meanwhile in youtube comments:
AAHAHA BLABLABLA GUNS ARE GUILTY"
"1867","I really don't like to get into these debates but, science shows why things are the way they are, what they're made of, how they are created, how they interact with the world around them. There is no scientific study or proof that shows that God doesn't exist. Just because we can prove that we evolved from single cell organisms or that our universe came from a singularity nearly 14 billion years ago (I do believe these by the way) doesn't mean we can automatically disapprove Gods existence. "
"1868","the music really doesn't fit the topic of the video. hhhhhhhhhh"
"1869","Lolwut, raging because of chickennuggets."
"1870","Think. If you go back far enough through the chain of cause and effect, atheism doesn't make sense. You can't have nothing and nothing react to make everything. You need a debatable factor in it, something that COULD explain it, but that doesn't always mean an old smiling man in the sky. Atheists need to understand that science can't do everything, and that flaunting the ideas they learned in 5th grade around on the internet just makes them look like asshats. You're just as clueless as them."
"1871","Columbine, terrible but the same day a mass murder was being commited by Clinton blowing up a medicine factory, but that's not important seeing they ain't American."
"1872","Hell doesn't excist, you'll figure it out if you READ the bible."
"1873","See, this guy has brains unlike the rest of you. This is a video about multiple tragedies that happened and you guys start a stupid argument over religious beliefs because of one fucking comment about God and the Bible. I'm christian, and one of my best friends is an atheist, so let's just accept that we all have different beliefs and get the fuck over it."
"1874","There wasn't a time before the big bang brother, the big bang was an extremely unstable particle that created an impulse making the universe. it's a theory just as god, atheists just flock to it because there is actual supporting proof. look it up if you dont know bro"
"1875","oh my god i dont even care anymore dude, you can't even keep up with your own comments"
"1876","You know, I'm atheist, but I can respect other's beliefs as well. come on now, christians can be just as logical as a non believer, they just were brought up in a different way and or have their own reasons to believe in a deity. Internet atheists make the rest of us like like assholes "
"1877","yep,send more guns into the hands of kids. americans ,you guys are helping the terrorists without knowing,"
"1878","we dont need gun control we need idiot control "
"1879","Explain to me what caused the big bang."
"1880","I don't think that such morbid acts can be ranked, they're all just as tragic and devastating as the other. "
"1881","Why when these shootings happen do people always blame movies music & other forms of entertainment I think its an excuse for the shooters to not take responsibility for the crimes they do. I watch these movies a lot & so do other people & you don'r hear anyone else doing any shooting "
"1882","So it is true, You Fucking athiest. God isnt a creature nor imaginary. Who the fuck do you think made the universe?"
"1883","OOoooo. Excellent comeback. See, you wouldn't look like a 12-year-old if you said (like a fucking respectable man) ""Oh. Thanks for pointing out my error. I accept that I was wrong.""

Yet your reply is an insult that hold no weight. It's equivalent to a 7-year-old on a playground taunting someone. You'd better be 12 or younger for you to have reason to do that."
"1884","Les Etats-Unis ne sont pas un grand pays. Pas par tous ses aspects, en tout cas !"
"1885","No need to be rude sir. The Bible describes those people of the time as those who did and thought evil continually and filled the earth with violence. God is the giver of life according to the Bible, therefore He can make decisions about who lives and dies. If you give something to someone you are well within your rights to take it away. God gave them 120 years to stop their evil and save themselves and get on the Ark but Noah and his family were the only takers. I am using my brain."

"1894","What is this place called hell? I checked on Google maps and found zero results."
"1895","Imaginary creatures can't make people shoot others..."
"1896","Another point about why evil is continued from the perspective of Christianity is how humanity chose separation of God, which is what that Garden of Eden story is about. So right now God is giving us a chance to learn what happens when we pick separation: namely death and destruction. For some strange reason humanity as whole hasn't learned their lesson so it has to continue until it gets bad enough to where do. That way sin can be destroyed, never to rise again as the Bible teaches."
"1897","Charles Darwin"
"1898","He is loving sir. If He were to intervene and wipe out the source of the evil in the world, what the Bible calls sin, then he would likely have to destroy all of us or at least a lot of us, because we all have it on some level in us. Because He cares and want to see as many saved for eternity as possible, He holds back so that as many possible can chose him be saved, stop doing wrong, and live to do right."
"1899","There's is no contradiction there. God can have a plan, certain things that people can not go against, yet have other things that require people to make a choice about whether or not they will cooperate or not. The choices He allows are to give us the opportunity to freely choose him and do right. You speak as though it has too be one extreme or another: God has to control everything with no choice or we have choice and God doesn't exist."

You can't have both, that is a complete contradiction.
Like I said, either cruel and set these things up, or indifferent and allowed it to happen.

Real loving, huh?"
"1909","The only way he can get mad from mcnuggets is that he was not able to get more nuggets"
"1910","He does have a plan but he gives us all some degree of choice over whether or not to cooperate with it by doing good. The problem us as a human race is that we don't always do it. He could force us to do everything but that would take away the beauty that comes with people freely choosing right."
"1911","He saying that because the Bible answers the question about who created the devil and how he chose to become evil. Obviously you missed those parts. In short, it explains how the God made the devil to be good but the devil decided that he would squander the perfection and goodness that was given to him to lead angels/people to disobey God and commit atrocities. God is in control of a lot but He decided to allow his creation to have free will to give them the opportunity to do good but many don't"

"1930","Fuck religion. There is no god."
"1931","And who, may I ask, made the devil?
And whom, may I ask, just sat by and watched as these shootings occurred rather than stop them?
That's what I thought. Your god is either cruel and set these up, or indifferent and allowed it to happen.
And no, if we have free-will, then there is no divine plan. And if there is a divine plan, then we have no free-will and he set these things up.
Both of these indicate that there is a flaw in Yahweh."

"1934","interesting fact, most of them were democrats or children whose parents exclusively voted democrat"
"1935","I do blame the shooters.  The Obama bits had nothing to do with the shootings, just saying what the news was showing as a side story to the actual events that have happened, and relaying as to how those worked out for U.S so far.  As for the shootings, it has been shown that the more gun laws made, the more gun laws are broken.  Take away the gun laws, have it optional for concealed-carry, and I guarantee you that the gun crimes will diminish.  "

"1953","Yes we do think. Fairly rationally. Don't you see how hard it is for someone to believe that an all powerful omnipotent being created everything and everyone in its entirety? Its completely ridiculous to hear. If there was no religion and someone told you they believed that, then you'd most likely think they were insane.

He was fifteen when it happened, and apparently because of childhood abuse and him having a mental illness they went 'easy' on him (this is in Chile). Crazy to think that someone that otherwise seemed 'normal' was a killer, just proves that the 'bad guys' aren't so easy to spot."

If enough people were unhappy with him, he could have been voted out.'"

"2139","yea to defend themselves from a tyrannical government or from opposing nations. not to shoot each other in the streets. and just because our founding fathers gave us the right doesn't mean it should still apply today, things have changed drastically since then. also robert i dont think u read and attained anything that i have written, i'm guessing its because of our cocky arrogant american attitude. maybe next time stick to the topic and not just cuss and pretend u know what ur talking about."

"2181","So much wrong in that sentence, it proves you want these banned yet know nothing about them. "
"2182","I don't think we need to hand in and register our already owned guns, and we already have background checks when we buy a gun, so it takes a while to buy a gun. I'd rather have it mandatory if you where buying your first gun you would have to take a free class on how to shoot, clean, and handle your gun, which the nra offers."
"2183","No. The right to bear arms was never some law to address some time-specific issue, it was and is to guarantee the right of every person to bear arms. It is eternal, and non-negotiable(despite current infringements).

ALL rights of man are eternal, and can only be rightfully expanded, never shrunk.


Bear. Not use, bear. Simple criminal record won't cause you to be denied your right to bear arms.

"2187","guns were a natural evolution of the hunger for war in the human race. guns have made one thing easier and that is to hunt and they are fun to shoot like shooting a bow. now that being said we cant turn back time and completely remove guns so in that case the argument for people to carry a concealed weapon is to protect themselves from people who don't care about human life and want to just kill people. in many of these cases if someone on screen had a gun the death toll could have been less "

I've gone through some rough times in life and have family members that went through way worse. None of us has had any desire to harm others because were not mentally f$&ed up. The amazing answer to the ""motive mystery""!"
"2199","So people are killing people, to save themselves from being killed? Sigh..."
"2200","According to the FBI, over a million people each year in the U.S. are saved from rapists and other attackers by defending themselves with a firearm. 

Firearms are used to murder about 8000 people each year, most of those related to gangs and drug violence, and many are unregistered, illegally purchased firearms smuggled with drugs."
"2201","Are you being really unclear and saying those things are bad? or are you seriously defending gun usage for that?"
"2202","even worse. imagine what would happen if those bombs actually detonated properly. it would've taken away more than 100 lives."
"2203","What made Columbine so bad was that teenagers with guns ran into a school that was in session and planted bombs that they made themselves. Sure the bombs failed but they actually killed 15 people. 15 is too many! "
"2204","Are you kidding me?? Frick you. They are all bad but your comment is just plain stupid."
"2205","i hate it when people blame artist or video games, i mean video games has nothing to do with it, if your mentally unstable your, mentally unstable a game doesnt make you that way, if thats the case we should have had like 15 mass shootings last year and this year, video games are gonna get worse
"
"2206","Collumbine really? 15 people died, the fucking mcdonalds spree was worse."
"2207","i emphasize the word USE if i was a bad guy and fired a gun at a practice target i won't get in trouble. but because of my criminal record i am not allowed to own one. the constitution was made for 18th century problems but we are in the 21st century with whole new problem that sadly need to be crackdown on by using loop hole in the constitution "
"2208","Icp- the tower for #6 anyone o.o? whoop whoop. "
"2209","The gun trade is in fact protected since it is an inherent part of guns being acquired. Federal government can use commerce clause to regulate interstate firearms traffic, but inside of individual states it has no say.

You have no clue what a right actually is. You don't ""qualify"" for a right. Everyone's born with them, people only lose them for committing crimes.

The whole ""mental illness"" and ""drug use"" and ""felon"" clauses are horseshit since those are all subjectives."
"2210","........It's there so that the people can put the government in check if they start to act tyrannical. It is also there in case an invading military comes into America. That way, we can defend ourselves. You obviously didn't know that...."
"2211","it means we can use fire arms the gun trade however is not protected by this right so the government is ok to place restrictions on who can buy fire arms and how"
"2212","what the nation needs is law to help keep the fire arms out of these idiots and know to use it responsible but nooo the bra and some average gun owners think it's against the 2nd amendment"
"2213","The sad and scary part of this is not that there were 10 mass shootings but that there have been so many that a lot were left off this list. Wisconsin Sikh Temple, Edmond OK Post Office, several other schools and workplaces, etc."
"2214","Do you know why we have our 2nd amendment?"
"2215","I bet all of these are hoaxs"
"2216","dude you are so right and iv never heard something so right"
"2217","I guess they made this video before the Connecticut thing"
"2218","You are simply wrong, think of it this way, a robber would not attack someone who had a gun, because they are scared, instead attack someone who does not have a gun, if concealed carry was illegal, then the innocents would have no way to protect themselves. Also, if criminals are going to commit crimes, they are going to do it weather they are allowed to carry guns or not, you are plain wrong.
"
"2219","And this is a good thing. If you have noticed the places with the most laxed gun laws ( like america ) are places that have the most problems. The right to bear arms is an amendment thats been so misconstrued and is whats causing these problems. I dont care if ur a veteran or not guns shouldnt be allowed on public streets and this whole thing about a "" SPECIAL license "" is complete nonsense. A true veteran with what they have seen guns do would disassemble the unit so it cant be used."

"2223","I know  :( sad list"
"2224","I understand your opinion in which this video is 'not suitable', but can you please explain WHY ? As far as I'm concerned, the author of the video listed down the 10 worst mass shootings on U.S soil in a factual manner, for educational purposes. The author makes other Top 10 videos in which negative things are described and involved death such as Top 10 Unsolved Murder Mysteries and Top 10 Man-Made Disasters, so why, in your honest opinion, is the above video any different/ less suitable ?"
"2225","Fair enough, I guess I was being stereotypical. But when I hear of teenagers being gunned down outside of a school by a rival gang I don't know what else to think. I'm sure it's nice to the people who live there. But I wouldn't feel safe without a legally owned fun with more than seven shots to defend myself."

"2231","Yeah in places like New York and Chicago where almost all guns there are illegally owned. "
"2232","I live in Australia. We only have a max of about 4 shootings per week in Sydeny that are mostly drive by and targeted. So its not bad at all."

My dad signed me up for pistol shooting lessons when I was 9, so I knew how to handle and use handguns safely. I don't think we have to many guns, we just have to many idiots who think they're gun experts going and go and buy them. even though they have no idea how to use them."

Im glad I live in a country where the awerage citizen doesnt own a gun, and the bigest one you can get (if you want one) is a small pistol or a hunting rifle/shotgun.

Look at fred from blues clues he fucking shot himself in a dressing room before an episode.. No one boycotted Nickelodeon because its a kids show. I bet you anything that if someone from a metal/punk/goth band shot his/her self they would blame it for teens also doing the same.  Lol america needs a reality check "
"2272","Yeah I hate that shit.  For one they didn't even like his music.  Even if they did why the fuck should they blame a guy who sings some rock songs instead of the actual people who did the shooting."

"2292","1:30 i watched the movie about the D.C. shootings"
"2293","note the date on the video"
"2294","While that is true, guns are the main reason why death tolls were so high."
"2295","Why doesnt anyone shoot up the police station like this?"
"2296","Agreee. But if someone has a mental problem and can get a gun, it becomes both problems.
The solution should be on limiting access to firearms. On the other side, the reason there are so many people with mental problems, it has to do with post-traumatic stress disorder, whose symptoms are seen in 1 in 5 soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan (not counting other wars in the past). It's common to hear a father or mother that is son ""he never came back / his not the same anymore""."

"2311","Lol chicken nuggets made him a crazy. That's just a sick way to earn cash wow"
"2312","They forget the Trolley Square Shooting"
"2313","I agree with you that gun control can help, but you have to admit that a normal person wouldn't do that kind of stuff."
"2314","the problem is of course the guns?! look at other countries, who have gun control...you are really stupid sometimes"
"2315","Actually, I am not that surprised seeing that people are constantly trying to sue McDonald's over the most ridiculous things."
"2316","its both actully, the fact that kids can order guns from the internet without any regulations is pretty fucked up."
"2317","True words by Manson."
"2318","yeah, I was in the Navy in chicago when that happened. one of my squad leaders was from that town and was really struck by it"
"2319","is no one else bothered that the guys wife tried to sue mcdonalds for him being a fuck?"
"2320","MARILYN MANSON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH COLUMBINE. End of story."
"2321","the word massacre makes it sound so much worse"
"2322","why tf was this recommended for me"
"2323","There is a joke about the joker shooting up a movie therater in The dark knight?"
"2324","Blaming games for violence, HA, that's like blaming a turkey for eating another bird because it had feathers...makes no sense."
"2325","Its mental problem not a gun one!"
"2326","Fuck you"
"2327","4:08 theres waldo"

"2333","Gayyyy!! Fucking all lies"
"2334","I remember the Newtown Shooting, it was the day after my 15th birthday and I felt like crap when I came home and my mom told about it."
"2335","Eric Harris <3333"
"2336","This was put out before newtown"
"2337","Did you guys make this video before Newtown? 
"
"2338","All you would be doing is putting people who have no intention of hurting anyone in jail. I would be willing to bet every dollar I have earned that you would change your opinion if you were in a situation where someone was going to harm you or your loved ones."
"2339","Why do they keep saying that games and movies it not the resson why it bullying and all that ather crap"
"2340","Huh.. I never heard that quote at the end... Very profound.  I gained a new respect for him for saying that.  ""I wouldn't say a single word to them.  I'd listen to what they have to say.."""
"2341","mk"
"2342","again this is just my opinion so don't get your panties in a wad but if guns become illegal, the ""gun wars"", fighting for control of the weapons black market, would be similar to the current drug wars in mexico, they would just play out on a worldwide scale.

i look forward to many of you cussing me out :) 
cheers."
"2343","the major problem i see with increased gun control is the assumption that murderers follow laws...
In making it difficult/illegal for anyone to own a gun, you are only taking guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.  Criminals aren't going to give up guns because the gov said so.  The illegal weapons market would become chaos, with every organized crime syndicate in the world fighting for control.
Your now left with a situation in which the only people that have guns are criminals and cops"
"2344"," Mayan Palace Theater, San Antonio, Texas off duty cops kills soon to be gunman. Winnemucca, Nev., 2008 a civilian with a concealed weapon, 2 dead +gunman. Appalachian School of Law, 2002: two armed students stop attack three dead. Santee, Calif., 2001: student fires on classmates off duty cop with stops attack, two dead. Pearl High School, Mississippi, 1997, prinipal stops shooter two dead. Edinboro, Pa., 1998 resturant owner stops attack 1 dead. the attacks are stopped before many are killed"
"2345","It says 'in the US' in the title. WOAH!"
"2346","10/10 of these shootings are in the U.S.!!! WTF"
"2347","2/10 of these shootings are in colorado!!! WTF"
"2348","sure is right. please dont make the same foolishness which I did caused losing all my pics and videos of my whole trips when my hard drive got crashed. Between now my all personal files have a full back up with this cool free service. if you are serious go for it now bit.ly/18NVICc?=doukf"
"2349","hmmm. outlawing all guns is the first step. yes criminals get their guns ilegally but the penalty for carrying a gun without permission is not very serious. if it was somethnig like 5 years of imprisonment without the possiblity of parole and second time 10 years, peope would slowly stop carrying guns illegally."
"2350","Yea because most of criminals obtain them LEGALLY. Laws don't prevent crime. Smart people carrying guns do."
"2351","I dunno man. People are dangerous as it is. I don't think adding more guns to the fray would help. 
"
"2352","criminals would think twice before committing any crime if everyone carried. people who commit crimes do it against people they know are defensless."
"2353","exactly...
if civilians werent allowed to own and carry weapons, there wouldnt be shootings in the first place."
"2354","yeah i agree with you. i was being sarcastic.
only police officers and military personel should carry weapons. that way anyone carrying a gun will be punished and with time civilians wont carry guns anymore."
"2355","Awesome."
"2356","sandy hook happend on the 14th of Dec. this video was put up in the 5th of Dec. you do the math :)"
"2357","They should have just shot themselves instead."
"2358","That woman that tried to sue macdonalds for their mcnuggets should be locked up. That bitch is hella crazy"
"2359","I'm not really sure what you're for or against but i'm all for getting rid of the whole "" you can walk into wal-mart or whatever you have in America and coming out with 12 high powered rifles"", that's just retarded"
"2360","fun fact: weapons lobby in usa claims that people that died in shooting tragedies were killed because they were unarmed so to prevent these kind of tragedies in the future, more civilians shall carry weapons...
way to go morons..."
"2361","Damn those McNuggets!"
"2362","*facepalm* just... just NO!"
"2363","*Before"
"2364","The Sandy Hook shooting happened after this video was made."
"2365","This is what happends when parents didnt whoop their ass whenth"
"2366","What about sandy hooks?"
"2367","Man the bald guy is creepy at 0:50"
"2368","Hey, dont blame the delicious Mc nuggets"
"2369","I would have thought the mass killing of the twin towers would have been number one but maybe its just with guns instead of planes as a projectile. But what do I know. "
"2370","that's true. thanks."
"2371","I am glad we have reached this mutual understanding. "
"2372","different states have different punishments."
"2373","cunt."
"2374","Should have waited a couple weeks to make this video lol."
"2375","R.I.P to those who died in those massacres."
"2376"," Top 10 ? according too whom? This top 10 is Bunk!"
"2377","ok so they executed the only black sniper. when are they going to execute that crab carrot top ""the joker?"""
"2378","really*"
"2379","Not realy."
"2380","Your point has nothing to do with what he said, Guns do not kill people, just as Violent Video games don't make people violent, its people that are fucked in the head that do stupid crap like this, and Humans are (by instinct) killers."
"2381","wow....nine days short...."
"2382","their sole purpose is to kill, that's what for they were designed and that's what they do."
"2383","Shit, i just ate some Mcnuggs.."
"2384","HEY, MA HUSBAND HAD SOME BAD MCNUGGETS, SO HE WENT ON A KILLIN RAMPAGE"
"2385","He is actually the opposite."
"2386","why are there so many attacks in Texas.........it worries me because i live in that state.
"
"2387","Never heard of Anders Behring Breivik?"
"2388","Yes Marilyn Manson is pretty intelligent"
"2389","Marilyn Manson? Your a dumb shit"
"2390","ur missing the point Mr.'Murica."
"2391","Marlyn Manson is one of the most intelligent guys out there "
"2392","newtown. worst. i know you made this video before, but newtown."
"2393","I remember seeing 4 people the other day. I'm not watching the video again to find more but I definitely remember 4 non-Caucasians."
"2394","Seriously!? a TOP TEN for shootings? Absolutely sickening thing to do. And now, at number one!..... "
"2395","lets see two blacks a muslim a asian and those are just the ones on the list that I know of"
"2396","yeah only 2 out of the 10 shootings... thats it"
"2397","Yea man lol
"
"2398","yo these white trash can talk on the internet, but in real life their just a bunch of losers"
"2399","that shit only happen's in the U.S"
"2400","speak now BITCH!"
"2401","And learn how to get a life u stupid waste of shit!"
"2402","What are you getting at? I saw quite a few people on this list that weren't Caucasian."
"2403","and an asian"
"2404","I like how they blamed Marilyn Manson for the Columbine shooting. At least part of it. They weren't influenced by him, the things they did just fed them ideas and rage boiled. Haven't you ever been bullied before? It hurts. And they wanted revenge. Had the schools in the US pay more attention to the bullying going on, nothing like this or other things would have ever happened. "
"2405","Number 7. Five days after my plane ride home from Iraq. I was at Fort Hood that day. So many taken away, good men and women who just wanted to protect loved ones."
"2406","taking ur life after taking so many i call that a bitch move"
"2407","bad is saying the least."
"2408","The killers at the end were un stable."
"2409","Video games don't fucking make people go on shooting sprees -_-"
"2410","Ok so all i saw was horrific violence and tragedy at the same time as 10 very good arguments for gun control. Seriously? its just ridiculous"
"2411","Do you even know the meaning of the word? I mean, for you to be craving so much attention from anonymous strangers on the internet... either you need to go get a CAT scan on your head or get a better hobby.  No one has done anything wrong to you here, at least to my knowledge."
"2412","i think the December 14th elementary school shooting was the worst, and most sick shooting.
apparently, this was uploaded 9 days prior to that shooting."
"2413","that fucking aurora shooter got the insanity sentence.
I think he was acting all crazy, and wide eyed at his trials.
That's why he is not in prison, serving a much aggressive sentance"
"2414","Call me crazy, but I blame the fucker who shot the people."
"2415","You must be a part of the Westboro Baptist Church."
"2416","hope u rott in hell "
"2417","violent movies and video games lmao"
"2418","I fucking hate how they use the media as scapegoats for these tragedy's in the case of school shootings the parents are really to blame  "
"2419","but you seem like you actually enjoy it"
"2420","ehh thats not funny. Not even as a joke. That shit was taken too far."
"2421","Marilyn Manson always says the best things."
"2422","I'm from Littleton Colorado and its still sad till this day to drive past columbine."
"2423","Did I just hear that right? The McNuggets were responsible for that guy's psychotic episode according to his wife? 3:30"
"2424","go kill your self you sick freak"
"2425","""Your Chicken McNuggets drove my husband crazy.""   WTF"
"2426","how can you rate these in a list like movies, this stuff is horrible"
"2427","Why isn't Boston. On th"
"2428","I would be careful of what you joke about on the internet, after the that dude got arrested for joking about shooting people on facebook. A joke can turn your life to shit real quick it seems."
"2429","you fail at trolling. maybe one day youll be as good as me"
"2430","touche"
"2431","Ah, I see you are a part of the Westboro Baptist Chruch."
"2432","are you sane?"
"2433","Yeah you're DEFINITELY on some government list now..."
"2434","Dad gets to check out early via execution while the kid spends the rest of his life behind bars? Lulwut?"
"2435","I got a boner."
"2436","I don't think we need lists for these sort of things"
"2437","Please stay away from guns, please."

"2442","Isn't that the purpose of this video? "
"2443","Don't seem like it. Then that means, you must be an ALIEN FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET. Let me give you a tour of America. America is a nice place to settle and if you're hungry, right across the street is a McDonalds and they have burger for as low as 99 cents!"
"2444","You sir are an ass. You should feel horrible. I hope one day the guilt gets so bad you go fucking insane. "
"2445","His Mum never loved him ?"
"2446","Psycho read what you just wrote here ''because that gay looking kid got killed'' You need to go to hospital."
"2447","so now you're saying that places that don't have guns have the most shootings occur out of anywhere?.."
"2448","Sandy hook shootings happend 1 week after this was posted."
"2449","How do you know this guy is trolling and doesn't believe what he's saying?  Has a mental issue?  Maybe needs the attention and it could be his last ditch effort to reach out to someone before he reaches his breaking point.  For someone to say something like he did there is obviously something wrong with him and debunking and ignoring problems by labeling people as trolls is what leads to their alienation and ultimately their choice to act out irrationally.  Walk in their shoes before insulting."
"2450","if by loser you mean:

Rich, Famous, Influential.

yeah he's a loser. "

"2457","Sounds like you've never been to America"
"2458","Yeah he couldn't of said it better"
"2459","Marylin Manson for motherfucking president!"
"2460","Because America is stupid.

you can do whatever the fuck you want and kill whoever you want and in the end you will get life in jail with people fighting to keep you alive."
"2461","Ironic how this was uploaded 9 days before a horrible massacre."
"2462","lol malik"
"2463","I usually don't swear, but what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"2464","You sound like a bad person they way you type."
"2465","you can clearly see my face bitch boy.i wont debate with you.you cant be but 16 years old"
"2466","BITCH SHUT THE FUCK UP!.at least im not a bitch to show my face talking shit to losers like u u ugly motherfucker lol "
"2467","lol, thanks. can't believe i didn't read that."
"2468","I feel the love in the comments :)
"
"2469","clearly this was before the Sandy Hook shooting."
"2470","wow its called sarcasm , i think you are the 1 who is ""stupid as shit"" retard."
"2471","This was hard to watch made me cry
"
"2472","What a fucking great idea lets start handing out guns on street corners"
"2473","you and your gun grabbing left wing lunatics can have my guns....................once bullet at a time. Ready when you are. "
"2474","I agree with you, sir. Only police, the National Guard, and any military branch should hold firearms. But there's one small problem. Assume the government proposes a law that bans the sale of all firearms. That ought to slow the murder rates down, but not diminish them. There are Americans that would rather fight to the death than give up their guns. Plus, there will always be a way to obtain a gun, unfortunately. It's too late to do anything now. It seems banning guns would cause more problems."
"2475","I like he music in this video.. it really sets the mood:|"
"2476","its the way of life...people get opportunities and they have to make the right decisions for those opportunities"
"2477","Moral of the story: if more people carried guns, then these massacres either wouldn't happen or be over a lot sooner.  You'll never take guns away from bad people, so maybe try putting some in the hands of good people."
"2478","Sandy hook:(..."
"2479","lol, I was the same thing"
"2480","I was going to comment, what about sandy hook? But it did hoy happen yet"
"2481","It's always extreme religious types, only one religion if peaceful, Buddhism"
"2482","Why are you getting all asshole on me? I was saying this was posted 9 days before sandy hook. Argue with that. It's 100% true and I was making a statement. Don't be a cunt."
"2483","Well, 3 of the 10 were in Texas so that isn't even close to being true. ""Almost all"" as YOU said would clearly indicate that MOST are there. Well, it's not even half of the list."
"2484","Yeah, so it's understandable that it's not on the list. The uploader even went back and noted that fact after uploading the video if you cared to read the info at the top. Anyway, what is your point?"
"2485","why do people do this
"
"2486","chicken nuggets form mc donalds cause her husband to kill lmao"
"2487","ITS A CONSPIRACY !"
"2488","This was posted 9 DAYS before Sandy Hook... "
"2489","I meant why are we ranking mass shootings"
"2490","Because it is not a picture? I do not really understand your question! Why would this not be a video?"
"2491","most of those ""mass shootings"" happens in ""gun-free zones"" ask yourself  WHY? nobody will do it in the place where everyone would fight back. and you believe banning all guns can't prevent mentally disabled violent people from killing others? "
"2492","Why the fuck is this a video?"
"2493","If you really need to compensate for your tiny D so bad, just buy a musclecar."
"2494","Wow! Right on! these are my FAVOURITE ones! Great top 10! *Sarcasm noted*"
"2495","Molon Labe!!!!"
"2496","If you actually believe that, I feel sorry for you.  I will tell you one thing, though, I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY GUNS!  And neither will many Americans"
"2497","Dude. what the hell"
"2498","Ya forgot about the one from call of duty modern warfare 2 when makarov and others killed all those people"
"2499"," no what we should do is completely ban guns from anyone who is not working to protect out lives, and whoever has a gun get an extremely strict repercussion therefore there will be no mass murders due to a gun... DESTROY ALL GUNS AND THERE WILL NEVER BE A MURDER BY GUN, MILLIONS OF LIVES WILL BE SAVED,  "
"2500","Finland: 2.2% murder rate, no regulations of full autos or silencers."
"2501","Also the Czech Republic has a murder rate of 1.7% and there are lots of people with guns and plenty of people carry.  You don't even have to get a separate permit to carry."
"2502","Where are you getting those numbers?  According to the list I found, America is a lot farther down than fifth by rate, and even by number of homicides it is only eighth.  And every one of the countries above them either have a complete ban on civilian gun ownership, or at the very least registration and licensing.  You know who has a 0.7% murder rate?  Switzerland, where everyone is REQUIRED by law to own a machine gun.  Check and mate motherfucker."
"2503","Coop Dan this video was created in December of 2012, and the Boston Marathon Bombings didn't occur until 2013, so even if your comment does prove to be something I would agree with, it doesn't apply to this video."
"2504","27 murders everyday.  5.6 murder for 100 000 persons.  USA is number 5 in the world.  Congratulations and shame on you!"
"2505","The actuall worst one is boston marathon bombing"
"2506","What we should be doing is DECREASING GUN FREE ZONES!  Every single place where a mass shooting has occurred has been selected FOR THE PRECISE REASON THAT THERE WOULD BE LIMITED OR NO ARMED RESISTANCE UNTIL THE POLICE ARRIVED USUALLY TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING!"
"2507","One, the US DOES NOT have a shooting every week.  Please use facts, not BS and emotions.  Oh, I'm sorry, asking a liberal to use facts and logic, is like asking Ray Charles to paint the Mona Lisa.  They don't know what the fuck that is.

Two, the places that have the most gun violence in the US have the strictest laws.  Chicago, New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles...and on and on and on.

Three, guns are used millions of times each year to defend AGAINST attack."
"2508","Ah, ok. "
"2509","what is that supposed to prove?
there will always be ways to get hold of guns, even in countries that have strict laws imposed. but when you basically let anyone buy a gun, you get shootings every week as the world can see in the US."
"2510","No, I'm just crazy.  I just wanted to mirror what I said earlier for comedic effect and I love the whole ""laughing hysterically and then stopping dead"" thing."
"2511","Well either way, it is still the second worst mass shooting in US history being right behind VA Tech. So you're wrong when you say ""not that many victims""
Oh, and this is off topic, but do you laugh before everything you sy in real life too? :p
"
"2512","Hahahaha, no.  It definitely happened, as is confirmed by most of the gun control bills not making it though a massive wall of contrarian Republicans.  If the government had the reason and competence to make a fake tragedy that ironclad, anyone else in the way would be bribed or disappeared.  And no, the government is not plotting against it's people on that kind of scale anyways."
"2513","you forgot the one that has it's own day St. Valentines Day Massacre aka Al Capon's way to get rid of a rival."
"2514","RIP reb and vodka"
"2515","It's the second worst mass shooting in US history when it comes to death toll. That is only the case if the shooting actually happened."
"2516","Hahahaha, no.  Not that many victims, unless you have a soft spot for children of course."
"2517","This is soo sad"
"2518","And now #1...Sandy Hook"
"2519","Also, in regards to shootings in countries with strict gun control, look up the Erfurt massacre.

Do some damn research before shooting your mouth off next time (pun intended.)"
"2520","""Both countries (Isreal and Switzerland) also allow widespread carrying of concealed firearms, and yet, admits Dr. Arthur Kellerman, one of the foremost medical advocates of gun control, Switzerland and Israel 'have rates of homicide that are low despite rates of home firearm ownership that are at least as high as those in the United States.'""

Maybe it has more to do with the fact that 1 in 10 Americans take drugs that are known to cause suicidal thoughts."
"2521","days before ct shooting......."
"2522","The women who says ""that is not the point of the second amendment"" is wrong the point of the second amendment is to allow the people to carry on an armed struggle if the government takes away their rights so in a way the point of second amendment is to kill people"
"2523","EXACTLY."
"2524","EXACTLY."
"2525","'Top 10 Infamous North Korean Mass Shootings' sounds promising."
"2526","there's very little point making this list at all.
there's a new shooting every day in america.
do 10 worst shootings of a country that actually has their gun laws and citizens under control."
"2527","People are trying to get rid of the gun itself, which isn't the problem.  The problem is when the wrong person gets a hold of it.  If you actually look at the situation, almost all of the shooters either were bullied and abused or have some kind of mental problem (or both). "
"2528","I never said that, I understand it's too late for the US to have gun prohibition and even if  it did prohibition never works but if some gun control means less shootings I like that.
I now live in England and I'm much less likely to hear about a mass shooting here any time soon, not saying it doesn't happen but it happens allot less."
"2529","Someone's allot more likely to make a mistake if they have a pencil, though."
"2530","you're a fat white guy who lives with his parents, aren't you."
"2531","What am i suppose to find a CNN or MSNBC reporter saying that? 

There in obama's pocket.

They have always sided with the liberals and that will never change.

Obama could kill a little baby girl on National TV and you would never hear about it from CNN exc. 

There not a news channel. There a whatever the liberals want to hear channel. "
"2532","Ik that it happened after the video but that's crazy how it was only month later."
"2533","Sandy Hook happened in January. This video was a month earlier. That would've been number 1."
"2534","WAIT!! When dafuq was the date of the.Sandy hook shootings?"
"2535","You are correct, there is no evidence he wants to ban guns.

There was also no evidence of Hitler banning guns in Germany prior to his rampage, this is why many German civilians handed in their firearms without a care in the world.

The American people may not be the smartest in the world and they have their flaws, but at least they learn from History and put no trust in their Government.

History have proven 'gun control' IS the seed to a total gun ban."
"2536","When has Obama ever said the specific words ""make guns illegal?"" Send me a link of that that isn't Fox News or Rush Limbaugh and I'll shut up.

Obama is not about banning guns, just gun control, there is a difference, get that through your head.  "
"2537","Your a dumbass! Like all things that are outlawed people still have them for Ex. Drugs and slaves.

And if obama makes guns illegal i guess i'm going to be a felon.  "
"2538","bad guys will always have guns....its the good guy that you should be worrying about"
"2539","i dont kill innocent people.when obama enslaves you,you'll rely on people like me to save your ass.but don't worry cause i wont.ill let your obama loving ass serve him till your death,while i sip on moonshine in a mountain cave somewhere"
"2540","so emotional! mission accomplished the obama lovers show their true colors,so much hate."
"2541","tough guy,does talking shit on the internet make you feel big?"
"2542","are you mad?take up arms against me!"
"2543","i don't care am still coming to the USA this December to fuck all the pretty hoes, buy my nightclub and have fun am used to bullets"
"2544","I don't understand it either. Obviously most of these killers were actually law abiding from the outside. "
"2545","I can't believe some of you gun nuts actually believe the way to stop this kind of stuff is to put more guns in the hands of random people that are supposedly ""law abiding."" "
"2546","Are you stupid, or thinking about going on a rampage yourself?"
"2547","YEA FUCK U"
"2548","And I say fuck you...!"
"2549","To show the damage that humans can inflict towards others."
"2550","obama supports this video!
so i say fuck this video!"
"2551","What the fuck have soldiers got to do with it? They're fighting a war, not walking down the street."
"2552","The irony."
"2553","If being slightly less safe means I won't hear about some teenagers getting shot as frequently, I'll take my chances."
"2554","MAYBE....  a hatchet was designed to cut down trees,  yet it makes for a brutal killing machine when used relentlessly & with out remorse. MAYBE...  getting shot by a bullet would be way more humane than 3rd degree burns from bombs,  or being stabbed repeatedly with a knife,  or having your brains bashed in by a baseball bat.....  JUST maybe, a little less brutal than getting your head sawed off or dismembering body parts.  I'll take the bullet to the head thank you."
"2555","MAYBE.....   The media didnt decide to start exposing how often it happens until now,  until they start to make plans to push gun control legislation. Maybe the crime rate has actually dropped,  yet the media seem to show only what sells or benefits political arenas. Maybe if everyone was carrying a gun it would discourage gunmen from shooting up the place in GUN FREE ZONES.  MAYBE GOVERNMENT HAVING GUNS IS THE REAL PROBLEM & WE SHOULD DISARM THE GOVERNMENT!!"
"2556","Governments & corporations murder millions & get away with it. Maybe the guns are to protect ourselves from the madmen ruling our world, that even if guns were illegal,  that it wouldnt be any harder to get it, like illegal drugs. That means only the criminals & governments would have guns. I highly doubt that guns would stay out of the hands of criminals when our governments are responsible for operations like the Iran Contra & Fast & Furious. MAYBE. these shootings been happening for decades."
"2557","to show the damage that guns can do idiot "
"2558","Sorry to burst your bubble there Batman but murderers deserve to die."

"2567","When did i say America being worst or what ever you're on about? Also Britain alone had more troops deployed than America right up until 1944. There were also more Commonwealth forces deployed under British command on D-Day than American. I have never said America wasn't important, of course they were. they played a huge role My point was don't try and make out like Britain and Russia as well as other allied forces didn't play a key role. Because that war was won by the Allies not just America. "
"2568","Is it just me in thinking that giving mass shootings a top-ten list is kind of wrong?"
"2569","Go fuck yourself."
"2570","Then i guess people get fat because they have spoons, and people make mistakes because they have a pencil, and people crash because they have phones. Ignorant!"
"2571","And also Russia wasn't allies with us at first they were the Axis Powers....When Germany turned around and back stabbed them and starting taking parts of their country they called us for Help WE HATED Russia the only reason we were allies with them is because we wanted to end the war and stop Hitler as we were known for being against war and being neutral.....Stop being so ignorant about America being worst..You dont know shit. And before we started entering we called the lend lease act to help."
"2572","Ugh hello? Great Britian Wouldn't have won D-day, Nor, Battle of El Alamien When we entered war we put the 2nd most troops in the war germany benig 1# When if you were to go into D-day without America you would've lost. And Great Britian winning the battles ahahahha! name one battle Great britian won before America joining the war! LOL and The war started when Germany invaded poland and ENGLAND declared war Germany"
"2573","Cant*"
"2574","Typical uneducated american thought, If you look at the facts, the land of the 'Free' would be better off without guns, They do you no good, Unless you want your own country to be known as an unsafe country where you can even send your own kids to school... Dipshit"
"2575","So Russia and the commonwealth forces had nothing at all to do with it then right? You do know that the Brits won the battle of Britain before America had even entered the war? did you learn anything in history? I can tell just by reading some of your comments that you're not the not the sharpest tool in the box."
"2576","Cant take the evil out of people, but you can take the guns off them, Wouldnt you rather not have a gun knowing the chances of a nutcase having a gun is next to none?"

"2578","why can every retard get a gun in america?"

"2581","Yeah, that's kind of torture :)"
"2582","No one is trying to take over great britain, even if that was true wouldent it be all over the news? We can defend ourselves anyway,  we dont need America. If anything, America is more likely to be a victim of invasion because they pretty much rule most of the world, And when that day does happen, we will end up helping you out just like you did for us in ww2."
"2583","but what about people that rely on guns for food? i know tons of families that survive on deer, rabbit etc. meat through the winter because they cant afford to feed their kids any other way. they NEED their guns. but jeffsandychelsea is right, the black market would skyrocket. weeds illegal, doesnt mean you wont find it on 3/4 of the schools population. i think everyone that has a gun needs a locked gun case. kids wouldnt have access to the gun. that would cut down school shootings alittle."
"2584","no, i dont think so. it would definitely be on the list, but it wouldnt be #1. it would be #3 because 28 people died. which beats #3 on this list but is still less than #2."
"2585","i dont think any human has a right to kill another human being. that includes murderers. i think they should serve life sentences in confinement with no windows and only one door with a small slot for food to be taken in and out. and a vent to provide enough oxygen. they will never see another human being for the rest of their sad lives except for their victims faces which will be plastered on every wall. so they are forced to look at them. sooner or later theyll drive themselves insane."
"2586","No. As the bullet's didn't fire it self, the gun fired a bullet, but the man pulled the trigger. Therefore, people kill people. So shut the fuck up please, you know nothing. The gun wont kill people it self, would it? No. Someone needs to pull the trigger first."

"2596","Where's the foreskin massacre, where you remove a portion of your childs penis at birth? It's still legal to, shame on you."
"2597","It's rational to assume that peaceful people greatly outnumber those who would randomly kill people (else violent crime would be constant). Legal guns means that all the normal people would be able to protect themselves and the psychotic killers would have to deal with the possibility of being shot. And if there are as many violent criminals as you say, a LOT of regular people would be carrying guns to protect themselves, greatly deterring crime. "
"2598","2012 movie shooting was the worst one of my best friends from likethe 2nd grade brother died and it was in my home town

"
"2599","Usually a ""Top 10"" list indicates the ""best"" of something. Don't you think the title of this video is a bit insensitive considering the subject matter? And how exactly did you go about rating which shootings were most tragic or important? Maybe stick to entertainment lists."
"2600","Ik that the government is shit and so is the presidents ALL of them except JFK and Abe. But you cant talk shit when were the backbone keeping other communist trying to over run your country"

"2613","wouldnt happen if people would carry guns.....by the time you wait for the cops its too late"
"2614","Soon after at a Peace conference between France and Korea the poll was rigged by the Emperor and mass arguments were caused, causing North and South Korea to split up Soon after they stopped the Conference kicked France out and continued to spread communism soon after they attack france since we were allies we declared war which was a horrible mistake since no one was declared to win Vietnam War."
"2615","It started with us supplying The French in Indochina to stop communism we were supplying them 80% of war supplies Since we were Known As the Arsenal of Great Democracy back then Nam and Korea were trying to find a way to cut us off connections with France"

"2618","When I tell people that I'm from Colorado, one thing I get asked is, 'does everyone have a arsonal of guns and shit'."

"2622","Uh... we got into Vietnam because of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that was proven to be a false flag operation.  You're not too bright, are you?"
"2623","I think they need to make a top 10 deadliest suicide bombings in Iraq video next. Will make this stuff look like childrens games. Even the Sandy Hook shooting."
"2624","If it weren't for USA your sorry ass country would've been destroyed
"
"2625","Lol America killing more people atleast we had a reason In Vietnam They wanted America dead is was the Deadliest War Probably most deaths in a life team And we kill terrorist  today because they want to bomb us unlike Germany who killed 12 million innocent people because of persecution you idiot.

"2629","Yeah."
"2630","still not smart enough
"
"2631","You don't like guns. Don't buy them. But don't think for one second that banning them or severely restricting them is going to fix anything in the US. Strict gun control is easy in Britain, with its small island geography and tiny gun culture, but it will only create a massive black market and skyrocketing crime in the US.
Not to say that strict gun control is in any way ethical; utilitarian fucktards like you are incapable of arguing from principle so I have to adjust my arguments accordingly."
"2632","What about the north Hollywood shootout in 1997? I think that crazy shit deserves to be in here somewhere. "
"2633","I'd say the same about anybody that gets a gun."

"2637","The US is the most violent country in the world. Not for the occasional mass shooting, no, but for their brutal foreign policy that they've kept intact for 60+ years."
"2638","Funny we protect ourselves quite well in the UK without guns. I'm not saying get rid of guns altogether, but there needs to be stricter control. I believe people should go for some sort of psychological evaluation before they can purchase a gun. Then there are the types of gun. I mean if you live in a 1 bedroom apartment in California, do you really need 3 shot guns, a few 9mm, a Desert Eagle .50 an an Armalite AR-50  for good measure to protect yourself ??"
"2639","we need to protect ourselves some way or another and besides people everywhere can get guns on the black market even if guns were illegal and crime will greatly increase"
"2640","What they are saying is like saying only pizza can be eaten by Italians. It is like what the fuck?!? "
"2641","i agree some of these comments make foreigners look ignorant when some are really not"

"2644","Let us have all these cartels and gangs in your country and see how much your countries' crime increases. I will admit, mostly in the US. There have over 40 injuries by guns over the weekend in Chicago. But still, saying that shootings are ""Only in America"" like the one fucktard is just asenine."
"2645","Maybe adding the word worst to the title would make it better?"
"2646","""...by claiming their chicken nuggets gave her husband psychosis...."" REALLY???"
"2647","No its not."
"2648","this is sad that is called ""top 10""   as if its a sports center best plays list.  I understand the title.. but doesn't it seem a little demeaning. Im not offended, but does anyone understand what i mean?"
"2649","Sandy hook didn't occur until nearly a week after this video was made."
"2650","whats with all the dot dot dots?"
"2651","This was before the whole Connecticut school shooting... new #1?"

"2653","Holy shit I am still getting replies on this."
"2654","From last I heard, there was a shooting at a daycare center if I am not mistaken. Lefty is a racist. Fuck Kyle. Unsub Woody."

"2656","I was watching Superman vs the Flash...how did I get here"
"2657","...the funny thing about your ridiculous comment is the fact that 30 min ago we heard gunshots here in Curitiba (Brazil), the second gun event in our neighborhood this week...
P.S - U.S(America is the continent not the country) is very safe and pacific compared to many Latin American countries, or African and Asian ones, just run a little research and you will realize how silly you sound..."
"2658","He's not talking about that. He's saying that not only U.S.A has shootings. He's saying that the statement ""Only in America...."" is incorrect this, video is about America, but shootings happen every where. Oh, and as far as saying calling the U.S. ""America"" is incorrect, America is a Continent (North America, Central America and South America), so before insulting a place make sure you know which place you're insulting. You mouth-breather.  "
"2659","well if most american politicians and civilians hide behind the second amendment this then the country wouldn't be like Jamaica fucked.

"2667","I'd bet if this video had been made after the Newtown shooting in that elementary school when assembly had just started then, it would be at least on the top 5."
"2668","america is a big country so you have to take that into proportions. "
"2669","Its not that theres more shooting its that theres is more media coverage"
"2670","These are common in the USA people. Its not a surprise. There are multiple shootouts in the USA."
"2671","Marilyn Manson is Smarter than we think he is."
"2672","Much more common in the USA due to terrible gun laws"
"2673","But you have to admit that this kind of Shootings are very usual in the United States..."
"2674","The worst thing is that this video has only been up six months and it already needs to be updated. Not to mention that there is probably mentally ill people out here watching videos like these and deciding their sole ambition in life is to top one of these lists.  "
"2675","What the fuck? Making a top 10 about MASS SHOOTINGS? What has the world come to?"
"2676","Are you comparing 3rd world countries to the world's biggest superpower? "

"2680","Well yeah, it says ""Top 10 Infamous Mass Shootings in the U.S.""

U.S. being the key word."
"2681","We are not talking about wars here you dick. And if you want to bring war into it. America has killed more people in wars in the last 75 years than the Nazi's did in WW2.  The debate here is about people been killed by random gunmen"
"2682","Well, actually Africa is. But okay."
"2683","Explain germany killing 12 million people in 1940-1945 you piece of shit"
"2684","By that logic, yes, he is right. But you and everyone else knows that is not how he meant it. "
"2685","lets be honest the title says ""in the u.s."" so he's right. because they all only happened in america. don't get pissed off at him for you interpreting his comment to your own retarded agenda 
      "
"2686","Almost all of them happened in Texas..."

"2694","""Top 10 Infamous Mass Shootings"" - You people are fucking sick if you're actually going to rank shootings in a top 10 structure."
"2695","k I know tat girl doesn't like gun because she got shot with one but maybe if those people or anyone of these victims had a gun n them except of course the ones at schools or universities then there would have been less victims don't try to change human nature just roll with it I mean I am freaking 14 and I see that"
"2696","just that you have 10 or more of this shootings in a history is sick"
"2697","It's sad thats there is more :("
"2698","White folks shooting and they are beeing concider mentally in stable. Color folks shoot up serial killer ,terrorist, life in prison.. Fuck the system"
"2699","BoooHoo would you like a box of tissues ? I am well aware of how many people have lost their lives in these shootings and how sad it is. Nobody deserves to die. But while America continues to have such stupid gun laws that make it so easy to purchase weapons, these things are going to keep on happening. Yes they happen around the rest of the world, but nowhere near as on scale with America."

"2704","Listen up dipshit. You just proved exactly what I said. You told everyone that shootings are ""Only in America."" Notice that this video was not restricted to only school shootings, but also more shootings, like at diners (just an example). Let us speak of the Cumbria Shootings occurring on June 2nd, 2010, in England. . My point is that you said shootings only happened in America and then proved yourself wrong. Now, you are certainly a genuine fucktard."
"2705","Just trying to help."
"2706","I think you mean too."
"2707","too*

"
"2708","So many of those shootings happened in Texas and they love guns there, i live in texas and since i was little kids at my school have been going to gun ranges or hunting."
"2709",""" Only in America "" was a sarcastic comment numb nuts. I am well aware these things happen all over the world. But the facts point out quite clearly it happens more in America than anywhere else. As to your fail. You are as big a fucktard as SolidRebirth2k"
"2710","This is bullshit.
Those guys could have used knives or car accidents to kill just as many people."
"2711","but a shooting did occur in the uk so hes 100% right and you aren't. 
He said it happens in other places, and you helped him prove it.
You said it only happens in america, but you proved yourself wrong by saying it did happen in the uk.
i think id have to say........ fail."
"2712","Funny that there were 9 school shooting in 2012 in America and the last one to happen in the UK was 1997 :-) 
Now who's the fucktard ?"
"2713","i recommend the movie bowling for columbine to everyoone it really sheds some light on why we have so many shooting deaths"
"2714","Oh for the love of fucking god. What you are saying is that shootings only happen in America. Holy fuck. We have a fucktard on our hands guys. Shootings happen everywhere, EVERYWHERE. We, we as in the world, can not stop said shootings. It has already gotten out of our grasp. "

"2721","Wow what an f'd-up video. Not cool WatchMojo not cool."
"2722","Oh wait, sorry...... I got it wrong. Its at 25 years you are eligible for parole."
"2723","yup!. So if somebody gets a 1 life sentence they are in for 25 years.."

"2725","columbine was what got teachers to respond more to school bullying. usually school bullying and the fact that teachers and principals ignore it is what causes school gun violence. "

"
"2727","stupid people...."
"2728","I'm sorry to hear that :("
"2729","I met the brother of Rachel he was so sad and I agree that everyone should take Rachel's challenge."
"2730","That's the thing about the two kids at Columbine, they weren't bullied.  One of them even bragged about how he bullied some of the other kids at his school.

One of them was just a psychopath, plain and simple.  No amount of listening, counseling, or, as that event proved, gun control laws, would have prevented that tragedy.  He and his sidekick had planned to kill everyone, not just the preps and jocks.  The fact that people looked for something to blame was the real tragedy after it was over."
"2731","Only for handguns, which are the culprits in the overwhelming majority of murders.  Rifles account for a very small number of deaths, as are shotguns, and both are less restricted as a result."
"2732","but today you need a backround check?"
"2733","6 Life sentences is 150 years. "
"2734","What the number opening music?"
"2735","well now you have at number one the Newtown Massacre"
"2736","Those kids thought they were Gods.That was they're motives were."
"2737","Poor Marilyn Manson everybody picks on him and blames him for everything.

"
"2742","What did he use,,, a bazooka?? The only stupid person I have identified on this board is YOU! The man shot people with a gun that by definition is a ""shooting"". Now getting to the I originally wanted to make... I think the San Ysidro McDonald's shooting should replace the Aurora shooting at #4. I did not go to a McDonald's for months after the San Ysidro shooting out of fear but I saw Dark Knight  Rises days after that shooting (at an early matinee showing)."
"2743","So we are doing count downs on these?  Sad!"
"2744","Your so stupid if your going to sit here and tell me that SANDY HOOK had nothing to do with shooting there was an introder that shot people GOOGLE SANDY HOOK"
"2745","yes it was!!!!!!!"
"2746","Sandy hook wasn't a shooting.................."
"2747","Stupid people:

People that know nothing about something voicing their opinions."
"2748","This list seems indiscriminate, in that it doesn't go in order by total number of injuries or fatalities.  That said, I'll add #11 with the Kent State Massacres, May 4, 1970 when  the National Guard killed 4 & injured 9 of my generation's anti-war protestors.  The smaller numbers defy the impact this event had on the nation.  Wikipedia has a good description."
"2749","u're right.  i am glad to see freaky ipad3 which i got previous week as a gift from yt/apple questionnaire. Listen to this, dont forget to give ur email id and delivery address to receive via courier. you can also get it from here : bit.ly/105qhjE?=vcmcj"

"2752","Is that like funny? lol"
"2753","Where's the mass shooting at a school in Paducah, KY from 1997?"
"2754","are safe and responsible gun owners, its not JUST restricted to America, its just that you don't need a background check to get a gun (in some cases) everyone focus'es on the bad gun owners, the one in a million mentally deranged and psychotic person who takes a gun and kills someone, obviously means guns are evil things.."
"2755","as people from other people view it,"
"2756","Americans.."
"2757","Number one is Really da D.C Sniper that got everybody Scared and no one knew where it was Coming from for 23 days lol one shot one kill Sandy hook was just Sad cuz it was all lil innocent kids"

"2759","Yeah, like crims care about gun laws"
"2760","I agree with xmw2xacring you people lie to point your fingers but remember there are 3 more pointing rite back at you "
"2761","thats not a mass murder"
"2762","What about Dick Cheney, who shot some one because the person looked like a deer."
"2763","All of these shootings are examples of why gun control shouldn't even be a thing"
"2764","and today times civilians needs assault rifles and many other specialized massive killing weapons. so they will be able to use it in self defense against countries.

you are nothing more than ignorant SLAVE. STOP BEING A SLAVE"
"2765","no he's actually right

assault rifles are made for massive killings or more than 1 shot per sec so you can kill more than 10 persons

that is it's first intension

why pistols are most ""deadly"" simply because people don't want to hurt those that don't deserve. OR else they would take MG42 or some else minigun.

why do you think police has to ware assault rifles SIMPLE to control civilians to work for NOTHING.

it's happening in our country and in many others stop being ignorant"
"2766","first of all most of this events you saw here are done by innocent people that are desperate. And this should happen more often so people don't do stupid things to other people.

either comes to gunfire or suicide, guess what happens when it comes to the edge, ... 1, or 2, or both because this are acts of inocent people that noone ever listens to them and stood up for them.

when you already know you'll die you take this deaths with you that are making you die

I'm not saying that illegally imported firearms do not exist, it's just that they would be far harder to attain when illegal; look at the UK and Australia.

"2862","""If you outlaw guns only outlaws will carry guns."" 
That statement is completely not true. If you make the gun laws stricter, there is no reason why the police could not still carry guns. 
If you make it much harder to obtain a gun, there is no doubt that crimes committed with guns will go down. 
When people say you should change the gun laws in the US, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to get rid of guns entirely."

"2873","What?  They (criminals) most certainly would.  If you think that illegal importation and sale of firearms couldn't (and doesn't already) happen I would have you look to the illegal drug problem in the US.  Billions spent in the last few decades trying to stop drug runners, yet it remains laughably easy to buy your illegal drug of choice whenever and wherever you want.  Any type of firearms ban would only serve to hurt those that already obey the law and are by and large of no threat.       "
"2874","Also I have just remembered the Cambrian shootings, I have little idea how I forgot that, however that is still fewer shootings a year then the USA."
"2875","Look at the UK with its insanely low rate of mass murders and low rates of murder, and gun crime. We had a mass killing on this sort of scale in 1996. We then immediately increased gun laws and have had few problems since. Not only that but a large number of people have little training, personally when I visited the USA I was more worried about someone being hero and stop someone then the original nut trying to kill me himself. Also a knife-man can cover 20 feet before a gun can be drawn. Fact."

Europe has strict weapon laws and their criminal rate is less than in america.
I can understand that you like your rights to have a gun but it's so obvious that too much american can not handle a gun.
Remember, every weapon you carry can be used AGAINST you aswell! A ""psycho"" can easily disarm you and shoot you down. I bet this is faster than to slice you.

That would mean that their shooting lead to the downfall of the U.S government! Something that im quite sure never happend. Don't use the word anarchy if you dont know what it means. Anarchy is not chaos. People calling themselves democrats have caused the biggest massacres through history. So get your facts straight!"

A psycho can have you cut down and butchered long before the police arrive, that is if you even have time to make the call. Even the outlaws are scared of guns, statistics shows that cities with lose gunlaws have lower crimerate then those with strict gunlaws. Just look at Chicago, Washington, New York and LA, crimecapitols of the US."
"2918","Those who think strict gunlaws is the solution and that American gunculture is to blame I would like to bring to mind the Norwegian mass-shoting on Utöya. In a country with almost non-exusting gunculture and strict laws this animal Breivik slaughtered 69 youths at a summercamp 1hour drive from the capitol Oslo with a huntingrifle. No laws or restriction can stop these madmen, a shot to the brain however stops them in an instant. "

"2955","You're not finishing the title. It's not 'Top 10', it's 'Top 10 Infamous', meaning worst. "
"2956","This is whats wrong with the society, we make a top ten for something like this. Disgusting!"
"2957","Yea its a ranking system of ""worst tragedies that happened"", once again not as in top ten ""best thing happened in life"". I don't think people are finding this as just insensitive... I think they are ignoring the definitions of word cause they've seen so much videos or such about Top Ten as in Best. It says "" Infamous "" for god sake. Don't be sorry, never said u were an American."
"2958","Columbine FTW"
"2959","Love the unfitting music."
"2960","It's the fact that the title says ""Top Ten"", not the ""Infamous"" part of it. The connotations that come with the phrase ""Top Ten"" make the video seem like a sort of list or ranking system. That's why people are saying that it comes off as insensitive.
And sorry to say it, buddy, but I'm Australian. And according to zoos82's profile, so's he."

"2964","Oh MY god I fucking love Marilyn Manson :) I'm so very happy they ended the video with one of my all time favorite quotes from him."
"2965","This video was posted a week before those shootings occurred. But yes, that was very bad and unfortunate"
"2966","the fact that there are so many mass shootings that we can compile lists of 'best/worst' is a shocking indictment of our society. "
"2967","Sandy Hook has to be added. Can't stand those 2 punks from the Columbine Shooting. Afterwards, there was a rash of copycat shootings at other schools from kids who thought these boys were cool and that it's ok to shoot people who bully you. They used being bullied as an excuse. It wasn't about being bullied when they targeted a Black kid, called him a nigger and killed him for being Black. If I ever take a trip to Colorado, it'll be to spit on their graves."

"2976","The only ""Top Ten"" about war from this channel that I've seen are all fantasy, sci-fi or from movies. Actually, most of these Top Ten videos are about fictional or inoffensive topics. This one seems like it's treading on thin ice.
Like I said, I don't outright dislike the video. It's all very respectful. But something about the topic shown in this format rubs me the wrong way.
I don't think WatchMojo should've been the one to do this video. It's tone is so different from what they usually do."
"2977","but you dont mind the ones that say (biggest wars)? get the fuck outa here mate..."
"2978","Heared quite a few Muslim names religion is just a problem nothing more."
"2979","strange maralyins Manson is a really sensible person and the stupid Americans don't ban guns from civilians. "
"2980","Yes because Europe never has mass shootings. People like Anders Breivik, Matti Saari, Tim Kretchmer, Robert Steinhauser, Thomas Hamilton, Pekka Erik Auvinen, Derrick Bird, Friederick Liebacher, Ljubisa Bogdanovic, Farda Gadirov, Eric Borel, etc were all Americans. It might happen here more frequently, but Europe has had a ton of these shootings. "
"2981","Have we forgotten the mass killings of native americans by US Soldiers during the 1800's?"
"2982","i agree who in the right mind would make this"
"2983","why do mass shootings? Cause you can become famous and now people are nothing more than points in a ranking system.. God I hate media and society."

"2988","Marilyn Manson is absolutely right. I'll bow down to him because of that comment. Only ignorant people would blame such a tragedy on pop culture and especially video games. I've played the most violent video games ever and I listen to Marilyn Manson and I have no sudden urge or need whatsoever to kill another human being, not even a fly. God bless all the lives lost, but they truly are in a better place now."

"3000","Oh look... it's our resident a55hole handing out advice on how a massacre should be carried out. Dude, not only are you an a55hole with an admitted 'social reject' issue, but you're also about one sandwich short of a picnic. Would serve you right if the feds came knocking on your door! What a MORON."
"3001","My ex-fiance had been stationed in Fort Hood shortly after joining the military. He was serving in Iraq when the Fort Hood shooting happened. When I heard about the shooting, I said something no military girlfriend should ever say: ""Thank God he's in Iraq."""
"3002","Why does most of this happen in Texas"
"3003","Calm down, tiger. I'm not thinking of it in terms of ""Top Ten Best Shootings"". I pretty clearly said that. I'm just saying that the words ""Top Ten"", in this context, can come off as insensitive.
English is a funny language; the meanings of words can change completely depending on how they're used. I'm just hypothetically thinking in terms of a grieving parent stumbling onto this video and seeing the shooting that killed their son being rated as ""Number 6""."

"3009","Oh shut the fuck up you weirdo.. top 10 is top 10.. if you look at is in the way of the best 10 then you're just an idiot and clearly that's what you are doing.. this ""top 10"" means the 10 top of the list of how critical they were.. don't make comments like that if they don't make any sense you fool."

The people caught responsible for these mass shootings, just look at them (especially in the courtroom)  They act like mindless zombies without a single change of heart or thought... How could they have acted in this manor their entire lives prior and nobody every witnessed it. I just don't get how someone normal, school, wife maybe, go from being normal to pure evil, mindless and not empathetic"

"3037","This video seems like a bad idea. I don't dislike the video per se, but ranking things like this just seems... off. Insensitive. It's carried out in a very respectful way and all, but this is definitely the wrong format to do it. Maybe even just a title change. The words ""Top Ten"" cheapens the whole thing.
Now, I haven't been affected by something like this, but I'm sure that a someone who was affected by these shootings wouldn't want their life-changing tragedy to be rated from one to ten."

"3059","the biggest reason that there are so many deaths by gun shootings is because of the 2nd amendment and the ease of which to obtain weaponry. if civilians having guns with out a truly legitimate reason and self defense is not a reason, that is just part of the problem, by reson, i mean if you are a cop, have a farm, hunt game for a livng etc etc and can prove this, then you should only be able to have one with huge restrictions, it's a weapon of war, not peace. Deaths will decrease "

"3066","glad sandy hook hoax was not included"
"3067","I think Marilyn Manson's ending line with ""I wouldn't have said a single word to them, I would have listened to what they had to say and nobody's done that yet."" You may love him or you hate him but he knows what he's talking about, he's an intelligent guy. I respect everyone effected by the shootings in these videos."
"3068","Partialy. But I think more importantly, they have to make sure to minimize the bullying and keep the ""tough kids"" in check.
Not everyone got bullied in school and have to go through that bloodlust you know? In Japan, people who got bullied choose to commit suicide instead, because they have very strict gun controling law. Without gun, the bullied can't kill the bully, so they killed themself instead."
"3069","I had similar Bloodlust in my early High School career, by the time I graduated most of the people on my ""hit-list"" Had dropped out/got knocked up or made peace with me. I think it varies from person to person, but it's definitely normal to be going thru the last bit of puberty with a lil homicidal rage. Perhaps its the school AND the communities responsibility to make sure these antsy youngin's don't go apeshit with a firearm."
"3070","No, but I almost killed prople whom I considered delinquents and bullies in my school."

"3086","Politicians blame video games because the politicians who create legislation that is exposed to help children and adults, fail at it.  Instead of realizing that it's their fault, they have to find someone to blame it on.  There have been violent movies around for ages, and that made people no different.  Kids would run around pretend to kill each other, and were still doing that only in a different manner."

"3109","You just showed how little you really know my friend. Have a look at the US poverty statistics and you will get a grim picture. In the UK the poor are babysat. You can have no job but can still live in a government sponsored house and the government will pay for the food and you will still be given extra money to play with. Its the biggest gripe of most tax payers in the UK that there money is spend on full time dropouts. The same is no so true for the US. "
"3110","i totally agree and people who think sandy hook is a hoax are sick"
"3111","And yet again another American who is either lying ,cant be bothered to check british murder rates or been badly misinformed. british murder rates are at a 30 year low and last year our vioent crimes fell by over 17 per cent we have the largest drop in any European country.there were 734 murders in 1997 before the gun ban came in and last year we had 550 and have had less than 700 murders in the last 5 years please do some research and come back to me.

"3128","US murder rates are not the high on a world level. Its actually less them much of Europe and less then many places with much stricter gun control. You keep comparing the US rates to the UK but the UK is very wealthy and even the poor people there are very well off.

"3144","Brits and Australians love to get drunk and have fights thought u knew that we know our faults we know thats what going on a night out means but we are still alive the next day.So lets do this again why are your murder rates so high is it just chance that we have more violent crime than u and ur murder rate is off the scale and ours is extremely low."

"3150","Nothing to do with personal rights I dont want a gun like im not allowed a tank its just makes sense and the majority of the british public feel this way. u keep needing reasons to have guns yet ur murder rate is still rediculous im happy with not having guns if ur ok with being almost five time more likely to be shot today than me"
"3151","Yes and Cars provide a real serivce for transportation without them ur country would not servive thats a fact but something tells me if u all didnt have guns ud be ok like the rest of us "
"3152","per 100,000 people ur murder rates is near 5.0 ours is 1.2 so if we are so violent why do u have so many more murders just ansewr that"

"3155","hahahaha do u know how the IRA got military weapons, America supplied them my god how the hell have u got the nerve to bring that up without American supplies the IRA would have collapsed years before it did America kepe the IRA alive."

"3157","But this isnt the goverenment telling me what to do British people dont want guns this is the people telling the government what we want after shotings in schools british people forced the government to ban guns after huge outcry at what happened.And yes Magna Carta has three laws still used today with the most important being no man shall be stripped of his possessions his rights or his freedoms without trial this from 1000 years ago and we had more right thats blacks in america in the 60s"

And ur making things up britian murder rate and crime rates is at a 30 year low check the bbc website type in britian murder rate 30 year low u will see also stop making things up when u have no idea what ur talking about"
"3159","yea similar rates on everything except murder. Now why is that we have the same rates for violent crime yet ur murder rate makes u look like a 3rd world country"
"3160","ahh right the constitution u politicians amend when ever it suites them. Your sticking with something that was written hundreds of years ago which apply to a completely different country than your are now. And no im not American but on this subject u need to learn from countries who handle gun control alot better than u. U can learn from us ya know we will teach u haha"
"3161","look here you thick arse fucking American inbred hick maybe if your government hadn't been stupid enough to allow violent people to get hold of guns in the first place they would be able to enforce gun control really what your saying is that America is a spoilt child and the gun is it's favourite toy and you can't be bothered to take it away so your just going to let it run rabid it's disgusting and if it wasn't for the French we might still have some bloody control over you..... bastards 
"

"3174","Dumb fucking Australians. I hope you inbred shit-heads enjoy being a joke to the rest of the world."
"3175","Well thats very unlikely to happen, because most of the people who have guns, knows everything about gun saftey, It happens that someone accidentaly shoot someone. Like a accident on a construction site, or a drunk driver that hit someone. But realy what you can about gun saftey is: check for medical history if you want to buy a gun, and put armed security at school etc."
"3176","that's not necessarily true... what if a ""normal"" human being just happens to be wielding a gun, and accidentaly shoots another person in the face (it has happened), does that human being cease being a ""normal"" one? It kinda brings me back to my point, it's way easier to kill wether accidentaly or not, if you are wielding a gun..."
"3177","funny, I'd still say a person with a gun"
"3178","The facts Chris Meyer gives are correct. The UK does have more violent crime then the US. The Swiss have a much lower violent crime and murder rate then both and the Swiss is one of the heavily civilian armed nations in the world. So for the poor misguided people that think guns some how twist people in to doing evil things its not true and you would be an idiot to thing it does."

"3183","The murder rate in the US is higher then the UK though the US do include legal killing in there statistics,the UK only includes illegal.So the number is misleading & the reality on a world wide level, both the UK & US have quite a low murder rate.As far as crimes in general are concerned the US is broadly similar to the UK and this is the point people are trying to make.The US the most armed nation in the world with almost 1 gun per person has similar rates to the UK that has almost no guns."
"3184","Your average car can actually do more damage then your average gun."
"3185","That is simply not true. Since the hangun ban the number of people being injured with handguns in the UK went up not down. Then you get the likes is Switzerland that the some of the highest gun ownership rates in the world yet some of the lowest crime and lowest murder rates. The simple fact is there are many ways to kill people and if some wants to they still will. Even in the US a massive number of murders are committed without a gun. "
"3186","Hahaha, it's ironic that you claim to know Britain best because you live there. Yet, somehow you're also the expert on America. I didn't say you thought ""crime should be allowed"", I was pointing out how naive it is to believe that the police are magically going to appear and save you.

"3198","you seem to think because i dont like guns i think crime should be allowed its just stupid its not even an argument.The facts show arming everybody doesnt work its simple more guns mean more murders i cant explain it any simpler.Just look at ALL industrial nations gun control works Britians is at a 30 year low and all crime is down except pickpocketing and shoplifting check the bbc website.the problems in britian are theft and drunk people fighting in town centres on Saturday nights i live here"
"3199","Sandy hook"
"3200","so you need to ask yourself if u have less violent crime than us yet your murder rates are much higher. What is so different that we have more people attacked and robbed per person and have far less people murdered per person can you explain that to me.Are British people attacking people without trying to kill them and americans trying to kill people in attacks is that the difference.Or the fact american people have access to guns. Dont start this gang thing every country has gangs"
"3201","Apart your argument falls apart when you look at the facts. The violent crime rate in the Britain is far more then the US violent crime and murder combined."
"3202","What about the Saint Valentines day Massacare"
"3203","Hahaha, how naive. According to you if someone wants to attack, rape, or murder you in Britain, just have to wait until it's over and go tell the police about it instead of defending themselves. Maybe you should learn to understand those numbers you love quoting."
"3204","U just have to look at your numbers to find out why. These people in Britian who go to the police after a crime cant do so in America because they are dead with a bullet wound to the head abit hard to report an assault lying dead in a ditch and thats the difference."
"3205","its not the only thing but its the biggest thing.

I agree gun free zones don't work and I've said that. It is about where you're allowed to own guns. ""Lets not give the people in city's with the highest murder rates and see how long they'll last"" (that's what goes on inside city officials minds). Gun control =costing innocent people their lives No gun control= saving lives.   "
"3216","An hour outside of the City has lax gun laws? You know absolutely nothing. It gun laws change by state. California's, New York/ New Jersey's gun laws are so strict but yet they are in the top 5 for gun related homicides.

"3217","ok and gang memebers hsooting other gang members are included in everybody elses stats to so wjhy are u any different.And yes there were 550 murders in Britian last year.Look it up yourself.And having gun free zones wont work when u can buy a gun just outside. This isnt about where and when ur allowed guns its how easy access is. And most of Europeans arnt allowed guns we live under the EU regulations all the major powers have gun laws UK,Germany,France Italy all have gun laws"

"3225","If you really think there was only 500 murders in the UK in the past year you're even dumber than I thought. Gangs don't have power in the UK because they're small. Gangs don't have power in the United States either so that argument is stupid. The places in the United States with the strictest gun control have the highest gun murder rate so what you said is totally stupid and there's the proof to show it. Where there's no gun control in the US, there's a lower gun murder rate than in the UK.  "
"3226","Where are you getting your statistics from? 2% of all United states homicides are from a firearm. Take that number of 8,000 and divide it by three. That's the actual number of Firearm MURDERS in the US. That 8,000 consists of gang members shooting other gang members (which we really don't get upset about). My questions aren't hypothetical they're rhetorical an notice that you haven't answered one of them. Why don't gangs have power in Europe? Most of Europe allows civilians to own guns.  "

"3229","You cant compare the swiss to anybody else. These guns are kept genuinely for defence of their country not to use against each other like in America. As they have no real army so they need a militia.Plus when adult males are given weapons in Switzerland they are trained by the governement.Plus lets not forget the shootings in Switerland in the last 10 years considering they have no real gangs or social problems being one of the richest countries on earth. You will never get to the swiss standard"
"3230","I'm tired of people blaming Marilyn Manson, just because people listen to his music doesn't mean he tells them to do wrong, it's just like Charles Manson and the Beatles, they didn't tell him to kill, he was just crazy. "

"3232"," So you can conclude with that what you wish but there the facts."
"3233","And I am telling that the UK had much lower murder rates even before they introduced there much stricter gun laws. I am also telling you that the amount of crime involving firearms and more so the number of people being harmed with firearms in the UK rocketed for over 10 years after the tighter gun laws where introduced. The UK has much higher violent crime rate then the US and the rest of the world. The UK has a much higher murder rate then many countries with high gun ownership rates"
"3234","Im not sure if i should thumbs up or thumbs down this video "
"3235","Everything you say is hypothetical.questions like do you really think and what if.Im telling you in Britian our murder rates are MUCH lower then yours. Our gun murder rate is Much lower than yours.This is like me playing you in basketball me whooping you then you saying shall I tell you how to play basketball. Everything you say is contradicted by the amount of murders that happen in your country everyday.Your meant to learn from people who do things better than you not worse"
"3236","obviouslt they are different things but those stats are even worse for you.500 murders in uk 50 by firearm.12,000 murders in america 8,000 by firearm how redciculous is that.Like I said nobody thinks banning guns mean nobody will ever have a gun but like everywhere else where gun laws apply its extremely hard to get hold of a gun and extremely risky to use as you might be the only person for miles to have a gun and everybody knows it.Why dont gangs have complete power in Europe then."
"3237","If some one drinks or takes drugs and chooses to drive and kills someone there as guilty as some one who drinks or takes drugs and shoots some one with a gun. A gun is no more then a tool just like a car, a knife, a bow, a club. I car actually makes a better weapon then many guns out there and they are often used as such."
"3238","Murder is when you intentionally kill somebody.When a drink driver kills somebody it it not intentional.So its not murder.I wouldn't want to lose a family member to a drunk driver or to a gun.The police are trying their best to get drunk drivers off the road who kill people why don't they do the same for guns.They kill people aswell."
"3239","lol have a look at your facts again. Firstly the US gun stats also include police shootings, accidental shootings and self defence shootings. But as for your comment about drink drivers not being murders try loosing some one you love to them and see what you think then. I also don't know where you are getting your stats from. I don't have this years but in 2005 there was 5402 people injured in criminal acts with firearms in the UK  with a total of 21526 firearm offences. "
"3240","That is a totally farcical argument.I know your intelligence is limited due to being an American.Thats not an insult that's a fact.The people who kill with guns do it intentionally but the people who kill with cars do it by accident.Thats the difference.Why should I have to explain that to you.How many people were shot in the US last year.I do admit the USA is bigger and has more people in it and therefore there will be mor shootings.10000 in us 35 in uk just 35.Thats what i'm talking about."
"3241","This is very true. Even here in the UK if you really wanted a gun its not all that hard to get of one. A few hears ago we had a influx of what where effectively home made ones. But even if you cant do that you can import one relatively easily just like illegal drugs. "
"3242","In the US there are far more guns then cars. Yet more people are killed buy drunk drivers then in shootings. Do you think they should they can alcohol? How about speeding cars. Again more people are killed by speeding motorists so why not make any car capable of going over the speed limit illegal? Why not ban all cars and make people walk or take public transport.  I'm just trying to put it in perspective for you. "
"3243","I see you live in the UK. The reality is illegal firearms are readily available just like illegal drugs. If you really wanted one you could get one easily. In the UK the tight gun laws are actually relatively new. We had low gun crime even before the laws and even then just about all where with illegal guns. Take the handgun ban. There are no fewer people injured now in handgun incidences then before the ban. If anything the 10 years following the ban showed a marked increase."
"3244","You wouldn't know where to get one because you aren't a criminal, and you're not intelligent. An intelligent criminal would buy the guns from the black market and then distribute to lesser-intellectual thieves, a good ol' contraband of killers under the leadership of that one man that bought the guns in the first place."
"3245","No that's wrong.If I wanted to get a gun and shoot people with it.I wouldn't even know where to get one from.It would be impossible for me to get a gun.There are shootings in this country but they are rare.Very rare."

"3254","There's a difference between Murder rate and Gun murder rate, idiot. People in England were never allowed to own Full automatic military grade Assault rifles. You got it backwards. The criminal arming himself made us arm ourselves. You just assume that banning guns will mean bad people won't have them. When in reality they'll be the only ones with them. They won't just give them up. They'll have complete power. You clearly don't understand the concept of the second amendment and you never will. "

Im not telling you the stats are your murder rate is 5.0 ours in around 1.0 figure it out mate.All arming yourself does is make the criminal arm himself I rather a fist fight like what happens in Britian than a gun fight that happens in your country. And yea buddy we ve only banned hand guns in Britian since 1997 our murder rates have been lower than 1997 since 2002 and we have just hit a 30 year low last year"
"3258","Gun murders don't include cops shooting criminals! Do you really think that they'd just let you take their guns? Do I need to repeat this too? ""Hey I need that Ak-47 and I'm going to have to arrest you.""  Do you really think the criminal will be like ""Sure, here you go."" or do you think he'll be like ""Fuck you"" and then shoots the cop? I think he'll shoot the cop because he'll get away with it. Guns have always been banned in the UK. You are a fool who clearly knows nothing about this argument. "
"3259","Yes and gun murders in other countries include criminals and police shotting people to so dont use that as an excuse.So when the illegal guns are found u give them ten years in jail just for having it like we do in the UK and people are so afraid to carry guns just because of the toughness of the jail sentence. I dont know what your arguing against less guns mean less gun deaths its simple. We ban guns and have barely any gun murders u have guns and have murders every day figure it out"

That also includes criminals being shot by the police and home owners. I'm a proud gun owner. I'm the one being punished by gun control, not the people who threaten my family.  "
"3264","i apologize americans for this fellow brit 'ruthio1', ruthio are you stupid, when guns were banned in Britain the murder rate went through the roof, and the UK has the highest violent crime rate in the EU, americans are quite entitled to keep guns to defend themselves, imagine if they banned guns in the US what would they defend themselves with? "
"3265","How the hell can you say gun control is stupid when we have it and you dont and we have much better murder rates than you. Fact is ban guns make guns extremely hard to get a hold of like we have done in every other country and watch your murder rate fall like every other country.Listen we are better than you at this and the only way to learn is for better people to teach u you have 12,000 murders what do you think the problem is "
"3266","Well i'm sorry for stating my opinion, but your username made me Lawl."
"3267"," You can't ban guns because the bloods, crips, mongols, hells angels, Aryan brotherhood etc etc won't give them up.See where I'm getting at? I've been saying this the whole time. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE GUN LAWS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T BREAK THE LAW, THE PEOPLE WHO WON'T COMMIT A ""MASS SHOOTING"". I don't understand peoples' logic. They just assume ""Oh, they banned guns, not a single bad person has one now"" When in reality they'll be the only people with them!!! Gun control IS STUPID!!"
"3268","Right ok gun control is the problem thats why in all industrial nations that have gun laws there murder rate is lower than yours in many place 4 times lower than your. Now Britian is a very violent place yet we have a murder rate that makes you look like Syria now why is that.Point is having small areas we tough gun laws and then have a gun store 10 yards outside the zone is never going to work stupid idea. The whole place needs to be a gun free zone only way youve tried everything else"
"3269","Yeah lets look at numbers. Places where gun control is high: Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, Compton, Harlem. They're all the places with the highest Gun related homicides. Now lets look in Rural America where there is no Gun control and the homicide rate is less than in the UK's. Gun control is the problem. People who argue otherwise are fools. Gun control only takes away from the honest man who follows them. The honest man, who won't shoot up a public place. "

"3277","The old ""we need more guns to fight guns"" logic. Let me ask you this. What if one of the armed guards decides to go a bit mental with the gun? What then? More armed guards to watch over the guards that are watching over the students? Who pays for the armed guards? Who vets them? Where do they come from? Your logic is severely flawed and if you cant enter debate without going on the offensive, calling me an idiot then I don't think you are the person to answer these important questions are you.  "

Unfortunately, a world without violence is impossible. You can blame it on males if you like, mainly because testosterone is the real source of all violence. But in reality, a world without weapons is the worst of all for women.  'God made man and woman; Colonel Colt made them equal'. Think of the women who aren't allowed to have a weapon."
"3298","god help us"
"3299","So what was the point of telling me i need to ""see the world""?
and FYI, i dont have any parents, i grew up in a foster home and they ditch you when you turn 18 which is when i had to grown up on my own and everything i have i work for so you need to quit it with these huge assumptions youre making and then you call ME naive and narcissistic well what does that make you?? You're not very clever. No wonder you think guns are a good idea..."
"3300","It obviously went over your head. I was just pointing out how naive and narcissistic you seem to be. I don't care whether you get a gun or not. I just don't think that telling the country what THEY should and should not have is the role of uninformed children. 

P.S. Living in an apartment or dorm room that your parents pay for, may as well be the same thing as living with them. It shows the same degree of independence."
"3301","So i need to travel all over American so that i can see how dangerous it is and tahts suppose to convince me that i need a gun?
By the way i dont live with my parents...
Seriously, what was the point of your comment? lmao..
"
"3302","Texas has more massacres than any other state"
"3303","Whats Wrong With The People in the USA i think most of them are fucked in the head, 
get rid of the guns in the usa"
"3304","this is bullshit .....look at how many native americans killed by the us government

"
"3305","No, you live in an upper middle class neighborhood with your parents apparently. Maybe you should see the world before you start telling it how to run."
"3306","....really? If you weren't an obvious preteen, I'd answer that in sincerity. Maybe you should go back to video games, something you actually understand.

For everyone else: Should S.W.A.T. (Special Weapons and Tactics) have assault weapons? Yes. But in reality, every day patrol officers carry M4s and a multitude of other militarized weaponry in their squad cars. What are they using those for that civilians are not? It says plainly that police firearms are to be used only in self defense. Grow up"
"3307","Hahahaha, I'm attacking you? News flash kid. Just because you got beaten up in highschool, doesn't mean that's how the world works for the rest of your life. In all honesty, public school is more like county jail than real life. I can say that from experience in both. Truth is, not everyone is 19. Once you grow up, you'll realize how naive you really are now. ""God made man, bu Sam Colt made them equal."" When you grow up, you'll truly understand that. This isn't an attack, it's a hard truth, kid."
"3308","I see you have a case or the ostrich syndrome. "
"3309","Have you figured out how to make the criminals turn in their guns. Before answering, look up the definition of criminal. "
"3310","didnt they make a level on doom to practice the shooting?"
"3311","I didnt realize there was so many criminals in America, it must be a horrible country to live in if people need deadly weapons to feel safe.
I live in a nice area in LA i guess."
"3312","so you're saying that the S.W.A.T. members/people of the law shouldn't have assault rifles? the people that do their best to UPHOLD the law?
this has to be the most idiotic comment i've ever read.
fucking fail troll.
"
"3313","For no reason."
"3314","By the way I never said it was ok, for ANYONE to attack another person with any kind of weapon (including melee). Anybody who needs to beat or kill anyone (any age, 1-90 year old), as a looser. "
"3315","I am 19, I voted this too, so I beat you there. Ok, so why I can't I have an opinion, without you attacking it? Every little thing I say you attack it. Here is what I am for self-defense and STRICTER gun laws. THAT'S IT! And I am not naive.

The reason why I say self-defense, cause think of middle and high school. I was attacked by bullies. I was lucky I learned self-defense. Other wise I would be on the ground being kicked by 3 guys."
"3316",".....wow. You are so naive it's pathetic. I guess old people are supposed to power up and use ""karate"" when they're being robbed. Your entire argument is so ridiculous it's not even worth being called a fantasy. In my opinion, it's a very good thing you're not old enough to vote. Much less actually buy a gun."
"3317","Now I never said anything about using melee weapons (clubs and bats). You know now I look back, I didn't word my comment correctly, what I meant to say was ""I'm for more strict gun control"". I am all for self-defense, if you learn really good self-defense moves. It can get you out of 4-5 people attacking you, even with melee weapons. In self-defense (karate) you learn ways to stun or kill your enemy, without using a weapon (melee included). In my opinion a gun should be used only for: hunting.  "
"3318","virginia tech was worse than colombine"
"3319","this is why i am for stricter gun laws"
"3320","Or, it could be that you specify GUN CRIME. Let's ignore the fact that the UK has much higher rates of violence, rape, non-gun related murder, kidnapping, theft, robbery, vandalism and un-civil disobedience than the U.S."
"3321","You managed to use up two paragraphs without making a single logical point. Yes, police carry ""assault"" rifles in their squad cars on a regular basis. Even in your country, more police officers carry ""assault"" style weaponry than you would think. My question, that you completely ignored, is why? If there is no reason to have one outside of a war zone, why do they need them? For protection? By your logic it's ok for 6 men to beat you to death, as long as they use clubs. All you can do is take it."
"3322","sad as hell"
"3323","Well, if you're an American criminal, it makes things like armed robbery and murder easier. If you are a law abiding citizen, you need to protect yourself from the criminal. If you don't, who will? "
"3324","It's a cultural difference."
"3325","OK kid, describe to me the law you want passed that will convince Joe Criminal to turn in his guns. "
"3326","Yes, he used a knife. He killed 5 people. "
"3327","No guns won't solve anything look at Jack the ripper that idiot used a knife haha and the people where terrified really? Guns in the u.k like us Americans have you could of just blown his ass away."
"3328","...not to kill people. Again not including our officers and soldiers. And I do agree handguns are a treat too. You know I hate when a person (or a group) go do a killing spree and then kill themselves. I do not see any logic. Cause if you killed people then yourself, then what did you accomplish? You know? I think if you get into a fight, no weapons, just use self-defense. Thats the way it should be."
"3329","I used that example cause that was the first thing that popped into my head (after watching the video of course). I never really knew that police officers had assault rifles. I thought the SWAT team had it. I thought the police just had handguns and shotguns. 

Reason I am concerned, I do not know why the public (not including officers and soldiers) need to have assault rifles in their homes. It is not necessary. The only guns that peoples should have is the ones I listed. But only to hunt......"
"3330","marilyn manson had the answer all along. respect to him!"
"3331","Because American's like you act like your countries problems are top priority for the world, Why would I be jealous of a country dying from its own economical collapse? I live in Britain and we're much better off than you. And I'm not obsessed. I'm just sparking discussion with the more...reasonable of you. "
"3332","Surprise, trying to use dead children to make your petty arguments. 

Why do people ""need"" them? Why do police officers need them? If you believe it's ok for police officers to possess ""assault"" rifles, but not civilians, you're naive. Are they driving their squad cars into Fallujah every day? No, they drive down the same streets you do. 

Answer this question for me please. Why are you so concerned with a rifle that kills less a year than slippery showers? Aren't handguns a more logical threat?"
"3333","Hahaha, grow up kid. You've proven you've just a whiny little brat that doesn't know anything about the world. Why are you so concerned with the U.S. in the first place? Obsessed? Jealous?"
"3334","Just ban a gun. You can protect yourself using taser or learn martial arts. This ""I need a gun for protection"" is kinda bullshit. This is more on a danger to yourself or your family than protection since if you think someone is robbing your house because of paranoia or if your children accidentally found it and think it is a toy gun. And not all Americans are CIA or special agents where there is always someone after them isn't it? "
"3335","I watch anime so that means I watch them all day? where does that logic come from? and I think the pre-teen is you, who didnt even read the full convosation. I'm guessing you're one of them generic pre-teen lazy americans that go ""leave everything as it is, we need our guns for ....."" and expect the criminals just to have a change of heart. No country is /THIS/ bad with gun crime. Just America, so you need special procedures. "
"3336","The sad thing is that you could even come up with a top ten of this. 
"
"3337","why would u make a top ten of stuff like this"
"3338","its just so upsetting that people would do that."
"3339","I am not the only one, others would agree with me, example: the family members of the elementary school shooting would agree with me. 

Answer this question for me please: Why do people need assault/semi-automatic rifles, in their homes? 

FYI not including our soldiers, I mean the public."
"3340","Well the dude that did the elementary school shooting a week after this vidoe was made. He had assault rifles. And I personally do not like CoD, and I am not a kid. I am 19 years old and attending college, thank-you very much."
"3341","Surprise. The guy ranting about how everyone should do what he says regarding gun control because he knows everything.....is a pre-teen child that watches cartoons all day."
"3342","That's just it, YOU think people should only be allowed to have those. Just because you want things to be one way, doesn't mean the world has to stop and abide by your commands."
"3343","You sound like a child. Grow up and worry about your own country instead of rambling on about what you THINK you know about the U.S. from what you've seen on T.V."
"3344","Sounds like you're border line obsessed with what happens in America. Jealous?"
"3345","Why are you so obsessed with what happens in America? Jealous?"
"3346","Hellz yeah. Not so keen on Naruto though, I mostly enjoy comedic animes or animes with some sort of education or focus on culture, like Hetalia or Lucky Star etc, I'm currently watching ""Baka and Test"" "
"3347","Thank you do you like anime? "
"3348","So basically my idea, increased security right? Glad we're on an understanding on this.

and yes. I understand, its fine, you're a proud american and misinterpreted my arguement as me meaning your guns should be taken away, I accept your apology. "
"3349","That's why i never go to McDonald's."
"3350","I believe America should pay more atention on the gun free zones have some police officers around or volunteer watchmen that way many problems can be solved also I apologize if I've been rather rude sincerely I'm sorry."
"3351","(continued)
people up.
I don't see an alternative around it really, what would you suggest? "
"3352","Yeah, but if the gun free zones had tighter security. I mean, look at this footage. The people in them clearly have weapons designed to take out multiple people, meaning someone on CCTV wasn't doing their job's properly, if we had people working fully on the gun free zones monitoring this stuff, and alerting it before it happend, with security ready on hand, america can solve alot of problems.
1) Lowering gun crime.
2) Making more jobs avalible for the unemployed.
3) shutting all the ""anti-gun""."
"3353","1 in 2 civilians have guns in Switzerland and they have one of the lowest crime rate in the world I see your point but a ''gun free zone'' it's like for a criminal ''shooting spree zone'' schools and malls are where some of these shootings happen because nobody can stop them like I said the people who does these shootings are the mentally ill I believe that a mentally ill person should not own a gun many people have not seen that point."
"3354","They aren't assault rifles you've been playing too much call of duty kid civilians can own only semi-automatic rifles here in the states and there are some restrictions to the size of the magazine."
"3355","No one should had Assault Rifles? What is the reason to have one? I think the only guns should be sold is pistols (including revolvers) and shotguns (including old WW2 rifles)."
"3356","Adam Carolla puts it best, ""If you're going to commit a murder suicide just go ahead and skip to the suicide part"". "
"3357","sad that only 2 weeks after this video, one of the worst massacres happened, happenedand im not just saying that because they were kids..."
"3358","So let me get this straight you want people to be checked before they go in a public place do u know that your talking of a police state?  As for Guns look I see why some people are angry about guns but having a weapon is a right you take away that it's like your taking rights away from Americans because it kills people.  Next we should make it illegal to drink coke or ban cigarettes because it kills you too."
"3359","I'm not a generic ""take your guns away"" fag :I I mean, cant you just figure a way around this? Switzerland and Canada dont seem to have this much trouble, so you have to have solutions for it obviously...cant you just have.. like security checkpoints where your guns are taken away in public places like school and malls? if NOONE had a gun in one place, you whoudnt NEED a gun."
"3360","Try to sound happier than you do when you narrate. Just a tip."
"3361","It does say in the US. I'm not discounting what happened in Tasmania, but it does not have a spot in the video based on the fact that, as I'm quite sure you are aware, Tasmania is not in the US."
"3362","No our rights are not the cause of these mass shootings if you notice most of the people who do these sick acts are the mentally ill people with psychological problems not every gun owner does this stuff.Our american rights is what keeps us out of the hand of tyranny especially the second amendment if that right is taken away from us worse things could happend Hitler himself said ''To disarm the people is to control the people'' and he nearly turned Europe into his empire."
"3363","Come on guys really, a top 10 of shootings? How low can you go???"
"3364","""Mass shootings in the U.S."""
"3365","there's more to defending yourself then weaponry. and your ""american rights"" are what are causing these ""mass shootings"". Don't call me a brat because you got educated okay? if you work out alot, stop fucking whining. Learn some martial arts like disarming and shut up. Most people who will cause you harm with a gun arn't even ""marksmen"" stop acting like a self-entitled arsehole. "
"3366","I do work out a lot and I love martial arts but a marksmen can do much better from a farther distance than Jackie Chan can when seconds counts the police are moments away and people don""t buy guns because they are lazy to build their own strength the answer is simple like stated above.I don't need a british brat to tell me anything about MY AMERICAN RIGHTS."
"3367","this is purely my opinion but here in the UK guns are illeagal even to certain police, there is barely any gun crime. But it could be to do with education of weapons and discipline."
"3368","Watch how we solve problems with street shooting in ex USSR.Ukraine 2013

youtube.com/watch?v=2Gw8mAppf_Q"
"3369","""Probably the kind of guy who comes home and molests the cat and kicks the dog"" "
"3370","There was guns, and weapons back then, what are you talking about? "
"3371","well you americans haven't done a very good job prevented any of these so far. "
"3372","The police, maybe? if you want to defend yourself, take up karate. work out, stop using toys to defend yourself like a pussy, grow some balls. Thats why many people buy a gun, cause they're too lazy to actually build up their own strength. "
"3373","FYI, Almost everyone in Canada and Switzerland has a gun, and their crime is much lower than the US and UK combined. "
"3374","Altough this is quite informative, giving this events a grade, is just poor taste from you WatchMojo"
"3375","Alfred is right: Some people just want to watch the world burn..."
"3376","Gun Free Zones only disarm law abiding citizens. Criminals don't follow laws."
"3377","No North Hollywood Shootout? That should be #1, sure no one died except the robbers themselves but come on, Larry and Emil had AK-47s and were shooting everyone and everything up, they were unaffected by the police because they had full body armor and they had drum mags and lasted 44 minutes in a firefight against the police. The police murdered Emil though (RIP). And 3 cops have killed themselves since."
"3378","how the hell is the title is misleading? its some channels top ten list...omg they didnt have a mass murder spree that you know..boohoo. i bet you feel fucking smart as hell for knowing about that murder spree....faggot"
"3379","Americans are fucking retarded. Why does no other country need guns for 'protection'? The reason they need guns to protect themselves is because it's so easy for lunatics to get their hands on guns"
"3380","All Im saying is the title is misleading."
"3381","Wow seems like few people did not like my comment, but it was a shooting and it was part of United States history given it happened in the U.S. and I believe just that fact makes my point relevant to this video. Not to mention the fact that it was indeed the most if not one of the most deadliest school shootings in our history whether you like it or not."
"3382","None of these people should ever be identified, as in the case of many including Holmes, they are diagnosed narcissists. so giving them publicity is giving them what they want, as well as fuelling future massacres which there of course will be, this being America."
"3383","do you think the Adam Lanza elemntary school shooting would be number 1 on this list?"
"3384","you picture is sick."
"3385","I don't.

"
"3386","Why the fuck are you doing a mass shootings countdown? That's pretty sick."
"3387","What's the name of the song playing in the background please ?"
"3388","It's my right to bear arms against dictators and people who want to hurt me or my loved ones the beauty of the second amendment."
"3389","Well there would be no need to have guns for ""protection"" if there were no guns at all...
""Let's have guns to protect ourselves from the people that have guns"""
"3390","was there a need for this?"
"3391","America is not peaches and creams trust me I believe is one of the craziest countries myself and yes you are right you don't hear about people using guns for protection because the media finds it boring and would much rather prefer put on the front page about a mentally ill child using guns to kill people rather than say about how an armed citizen rescued an old lady from being assaulted.I'll admit it I love firearms but I would never do anything stupid with guns they are tools not toys."
"3392","considering you're American....this answer is absolutely hilarious!"
"3393","*gun at home"
"3394","I know but I thought America was suppose to be a nice wonderful country but Americans are obssessed with having guns for ""protection"" even though you dont actually hear about Americans  using them for protection, they just use them to kill and slaughter groups of people.
Americans like to make fun of other countries and call them ""3rd world countries"" but here they are so paranoid in their own home that they actually feel the need to have a fun at home -_-"
"3395","So I can defend myself and not depend on anyone on my protection and safety and yet have freedom."
"3396","to pretect are selfs aginst the people that shoot up schools and movies"
"3397","annnnnnnnnnnnnd why would we? "
"3398","They are suppose to be unexpected murders, I am not exactly familiar of the shooting you are talking about considering the fact that it was in the 1800's, you could have seen that coming from a mile away..."
"3399","EXACTLY !"
"3400","Why do so many Foreigners feel the need to dictated what we should do or not with our lives? Answer please and I might answer your ignorant question.  "
"3401","Why do so many Americans feel the need to have guns?
"
"3402","Well the Luby's is now a very good Asian Buffet."
"3403","Scam"
"3404","Wounded Knee?"
"3405","see im tired of this shit.they say it was multi media that caused the shooting.no.it was bulling.instead the teachers didnt listen.the government use this as a scape goat. "
"3406","It's so sad and eery that only 9 days after this video was posted Sandy Hook happened.. "
"3407","So put the video up yourself if it bothers you."
"3408",".....are you really that fucking naive?"
"3409","Get a life you fucking loser."
"3410",".....Statistically? That's ironic, being you're just assuming all of that."
"3411","If you want to go into Native American related massacres, you gotta start way before that. Like 1600s."
"3412","Remove! All this video does is bring fame to those who committed the atrociousness. You ranked them as though this is some sort of competition! What is wrong with you. The only reason these shooting keep happening is that the killers get so much attention. The victim should be remember but the killers removed from history."
"3413","No shit. Why? Were you talking this list seriously?"
"3414","I fucking hate when pussys blame other people for there doings"
"3415","ITS MOSTLY CHRISTIANS DAT DO ALL THIS CRAZY SHOOTING....AND ALL WHITE GUYS, PLUS WHITES RAPE THE MOST WOMEN AND MOLEST THE MOST KIDS...STATISTICALLY SAYING...LOOK IT UP IF YA DONT LIKE MY COMMENTS."
"3416","What a wonderful world we live in. What a world! "
"3417","It only happens in the U.S so may aswell drop the 'U.S' part. This is a grosse count down..idiots"
"3418","Chicken nuggets, number 1 cause of shootings apparently"
"3419","When are you Canadians going to quit whining about what happens in America? Are you that obsessed with us?

By the way, sounds like you have alot of pent up aggression towards bullying. I assume you've been picked on alot of your life and would like to make a suggestion as to cull the abuse: Stop whining like a little brat about things you know nothing about, and stop condescending a country you obviously spend too much time obsessing over to begin with."
"3420","Hahaha, so now you're just making blind accusations? I'd call you by an appropriate stereotype, but the truth is, no one thinks about your country long enough to come up with any. I'm sorry your international insignificance seems to bother you so, but like you said, ""get over yourself""."
"3421","Hahaha, just because Americans won't do what YOU want them to do? That's a tad hypocritical."
"3422","All Americans are idiotic when it comes to learning from past mistakes.  Mass shootings are only caused by two factors.
1) bullies are horrible shit stans no matter how hard you try to get it out another one takes its place. There punishment should be hit with stun gun or send to adult jail for mandatory 2 days maybe?
2) when the fuck are you Americans going to learn that it's way to easy for your kids to buy or use there parent guns."
"3423","Because your culture is way better than native Americans.. Stfu and have sex with your cousin"
"3424","You sound like a redneck.  I know your type.  I've seen deliverance.  Yeah thats you.  "
"3425","What I say will hurt your ego im sure.  But the truth hurts.  Get over yourself. "
"3426","stfu, the native tribes are a disgrace. a plague on society today. they just get drunk and fight over land and argue about the world and kill their own family members. even worst their gang banging posing attitude makes me wish natives never exist. walk in beauty. we have a poor definition of beauty when all you see on the rez is miles of trash.    "
"3427","i wouldnt expect any of you americans to listen to sound reason.  most of yous are up yourselves.  Your the perfect example. "
"3428","So let me get this straight. Only one of these shootings even involved an ""assault"" rifle....yet liberals want ""assault"" rifles banned. Pitiful really."
"3429","Why do you find it necessary to tell people in a country you've never even been to what they are and what they should do? Luckily, no one even considers your country to be relevant to the world, much less you."
"3430","What about Robert Hawkin's shooting?"
"3431","Shut up, faggot."
"3432","that didn't happen till like jan of 2013"
"3433","What about the 250-300 native American women and school  children killed by the U.S. Gov't in the late 1800's? Of course you won't see that on the list..."
"3434","How come the video doesnt mentioon how many died in the last two!!!"
"3435","What about the Connecticut elementary school shooting!??"
"3436","insanity causes people to kill "
"3437","Lol. No. we should ignore idiots like watch mojo trying to get views from tragedies."
"3438","good luck with that"
"3439","What drives a person to commit cold blooded murder? Is it love? May it never be! What is love? Can anybody over there in America tell me what love is? A nation full of everything but love.  Instead I see a rebellious people, full of hate, greed, envy, selfishness, pride, lies and deceit.  How could a nation such as this possibly tell the difference between love and hate?  Love is foreign to america.  They have left it behind them replcing it for dreams of grandeur lust masquerading as love.     "
"3440","I look at the comments and alot of people say its not only the guns its the crazy people too. Thats maybe true (it seems america is full of them) but how does that way of thinking include the 6year old boy who went to school one day and shot a little girl? The point is, he had access to something he shouldnt have had access to. That should also include you americans! Wouldnt it make more sense to get rid of something that gives ppl a more efficient means of killing someone..? "
"3441","If you're talking about Newtown, this video was posted about a week before that happened."
"3442","And who dose not play that? what Relevance does that have?"
"3443","and... all were GTA players XD"
"3444","all of these happen in gun free zones ........."
"3445","So more or less you encourage mass shootings? If you didn't notice the guys who comited those awful crimes killed people they disliked. "
"3446","Dear people let this video be a motivation to pick up your guns and shoot your enemies.
Point blank in the head put their dicks in the dirt and make their momma's cry.

Greetings from Serbia"
"3447","of course"
"3448","Fuck marilyn manson hope he gets ass cancer"
"3449","NZ have more conservative firearms laws than amerca. Im sure Canada is similar. Firearms in NZ arent that easily accessable compared to America.  I was watching a doco where some of your banks were giving away guns with thier bank loans!?  Thats unheard of here! Thats astonishing to me.  "
"3450","are you serious? How many massacre killings can one do with a hammer? 
Our cops here in New Zealand dont even carry guns. It would be unusual for NZ to suffer more than 20 killings by a gun in a year. (Including both intentional and accidental)   America on the other hand, its in the tens of thousands per year. If you want a more accurate and fairer comparision, then look at Canada. But even they suffer much less, on average 200 per year.   "
"3451","How is Columbine worse than Virginia Tech? No, just not. One man killed over 30 people with pistols, while 2 teenagers killed 13 students and teachers. And the teenagers had bombs, machine pistols, and assault rifles! That man had selective mutism and no real motive. He didn't speak to anyone, and he wasn't poor, and most people at VT aren't rich. I can see why Klebold and Harris did what they did, but Cho? Someone explain."
"3452","Look at the date of this video?"
"3453","That saying is so stupid, as humans we are doomed to repeat history everytime..."
"3454","You should look at some statistics. After the 94 gun ban expired there were more murders in the U.S. with hammers than with the weapons the ban was for."
"3455","it's kinda ironic that at the end of the video, manson, who was accused of influenting the shooters, actually said the smartest and kindest thing"
"3456","What about The mass shooting at the school that killed 21 people 19 kids 2 Teachers"
"3457","New town school shooting in 2012"
"3458","shutup"
"3459","yea because chicken nuggets make you crazy"
"3460","As I do agree in some cases a good large portion of the shootings that took place involved illegally obtained guns. "
"3461","it's not just guns, it's crazy people too"
"3462","Worst part is, the USA holds the record for the school shooting with the youngest murderer, the kid was 6 "
"3463","aww shit I thought it was to help us plan our own mass shooting. dangit! "
"3464","my grandma would call you a commie and spit on you."
"3465","there are way more than these ten lol these are just the ones that become really well-known. it's like tradition now. "
"3466","all working for the Reptilians of course"
"3467","was it also the illuminati?"
"3468","You americans got too many guns over there.  Youd be better off without them.  "
"3469","What the fuck kind of video is this?!"
"3470","This is all true, I to don't believe a  video like this is as it is inappropriate and disrespectful to the victims."
"3471","you are full of shit"
"3472","you're right. we should ignore these events like they didn't happen, makes sense..."
"3473","Marilyn Manson had nothing to do with the Columbine massacre, the shooters had problems of their own.  "
"3474","what manson said at the end is the perfect note to end it on....this lone gunmen,these people,have all gone through society and were scarred,some were open to suggestions,some were bullied and done wrong against."
"3475","Some care, some don't. I know the little pricks who shot up Columbine wanted to be famous. That's why they did everything on such a large scale. They knew the news would blow their story up"
"3476","nope."
"3477","You're an idiot."
"3478","You are a piece of shit scumbag.  Go eat a bowl of dicks, you cunt!"
"3479","The media has already blown this shit out of proportions anyway. I'm sure many people who commit mass shootings don't give a fuck who knew about them because they usually end up dead."
"3480","What is the point in giving someone 6 life sentences? Isn`t one enough?"
"3481","""columbine is a classic??"" hmm thats a new one..."
"3482","well more people were killed in sandy hook so it surpassed it"
"3483","Quote from???"
"3484","Killers are people who haven't had love and don't want other's to experience it."
"3485","True. I did not get the difference. everybodymakesmistakes.jpg but the message is the same. is there one mention of the victims? the families? no. It's their name and how many they killed and what an impact they caused. That's what pissed me off. This is what they want. They want people to do things like this. "
"3486","riiiiight those who think that gun laws stop criminals criminals! from getting guns are just....well idiots."
"3487","6 life sentences without parole quit wasting my tax dollars and just kill that bastard."
"3488",">""Without acknowledging our past, we are bound to repeat it""
>Sandy hook shooting occurs a couple of days after this video is posted.
Me: Well shit..."
"3489","What about the Native school shootings. Everybody  is afraid to talk about that. It was worse than all of this combined."
"3490","Maybe not call it a Top 10... Just 10 perhaps..."
"3491","I don't give a fuck about this it's just the us are idiots for letting place a gun free zone plus I am not from the us"
"3492","Read the Desc, bro.  This was published 7 days beforehand."
"3493","we all know now number one would have been Sandy hook. if they waited a few more weeks to do this video it wouldve been number one on here  "
"3494","No, these people were all of varied political backgrounds. And didn't Hitler's political views fall more in line with Republicans than they do with Democrats? Actually, they're very similar!"
"3495","shut the fuck up"
"3496","all LIBTARDS  OBAMA BUDS

"
"3497","Marijuana is banned...

Yet how many people still smoke it and can get a hold of it?????


Laws won't do anything."
"3498","At least the media focuses on the victims of these shootings, hey wait they don't..."
"3499","This is why Britain doesn't allow guns."
"3500","Putting the word ""Top"" in the title is what really makes this video seem inappropriate."
"3501","Bye"
"3502","Violence has been around since video games ever existed. Why blame? Blame your Government they make these tragic situations happen, they stage it all. It's no surprise."
"3503","I thought Marilyn Manson was dead already. Trent Reznor needs to beat the living shi* out of em'"
"3504","Why don't ppl read the description? Thanks for the vid wished I known about it sooner I would have asked permission to use on a ballistics project I was working on"
"3505","Y U WATCH?"
"3506","Well that escalated quickly..."
"3507","I think you fail to comprehend the difference between the word infamous, and famous."
"3508","Columbine happened on 4 20, trippy, ud think everyone wud be home smoking weed"
"3509","Not the kinda guy to bitch about things being disrespectful on youtube...but this is silly. What purpose does this serve? No reason to turn these events into a ""top 10"" other than to get viewers. Unfollowed. "
"3510","Stop crying, it's just a top 10 list. "
"3511","it good for us none americans i dident know about half of these im allso young"
"3512","But that's not the point. The point is people are going to get guns, whether there are gun laws or not. But with gun laws, citizens aren't able to legally defend themselves (and there are many, MANY more cases where citizens use weapons to defend themselves than there are cases of criminal activity involving firearms; media just fails to mention this because of liberal agenda). This is simply a fact. Most countries that have stricter gun laws than the United States also have higher murder rates."
"3513","Why do people continue to blame video games for violence? There have been mass murders, massacres and such since humans have walked the earth. And if video games where to blame, why arent more people use swords and axes to kill and only guns? After all the are loads of medieval games and games using medieval weaponry."
"3514","Well it's not any different than the many list about serial killers."
"3515","Can't we remove that fucking shit please ?????? 

What a stupid asshole would do such a list... Top 10 is something that you should be proud of, something funny, something rare... 

"
"3516","no we don't gun laws are the biggest problem. "
"3517","so many countries are so much worse. "
"3518","connecticut"
"3519","This video was made before that happened."
"3520","Where was the newtown school shooting?"
"3521","no
"
"3522","This is just want the killers want. They want people to remember them in this way. Counting down a top 10 of the most, ""infamous MASS shootings."" You just lost a viewer. Hopefully I'm not the only one."
"3523","In the piece, it doesn't say top 10 and is much more respectful"
"3524","Okay that sounds fine. Even though I can't really justify why you think that considering that they are used far more in defense than in homicides. When a victim doesn't defend himself the criminal succeeds 88% of the time. When a victim resists the number falls to 30%. But you are entitled to your own opinion. It was a good discussion."
"3525","no, nothing came up more than once for me. Though I think we may just have to agree to disagree on this one, otherwise we'll go round in circles and things will be said more than once. I guess my own final word on it is that as a 120 pound (well, probably more like 135 pound, but moving on) I appreciate the concern, but for me personally, when it comes to guns the cost doesn't really outweigh their possible advantages."
"3526","Yep. Guns were created to kill. No questions. But you have to remember guns are used way more in defense than in murders. Guns make a 120 pound woman equal to a 300 pound man. Which is why they are so useful for defense. So saying ""better not to have them at all"" doesn't really make sense to me. BTW sorry if it showed that I replied a few times. My computer got a bit messed up."
"3527","Yep. But even better to not have them at all. Guns that is. Pools are for recreational use. Many uses for matches. Theres only one use for and point of a gun. To kill."
"3528","It implies that because a person played a video game where u shoot people, they thought it would be fun to do it in real life. Which means that person is insane and probably would of killed other people in a different way eventually. It wouldnt ever make a sane person do something like that. "
"3529","blaming video games for  gun violence is like blaming hot wheels for car safety"
"3530","even in regards to recent events, in comparison to guns, bombs are rarely used. Bombs also dont give the crazy person who wants to kill, the satisfaction of shooting individual people. And you don't have to send me a PM about accidental fires and drownings- I believe you, and am sure there are more- but we cant really reduce the risk of them by getting rid of fire and water. We can however, reduce the risk of accidental shootings."
"3531","This is beautiful. Let me thank you now for making me laugh."
"3532","WHY DO PEOPLE KILL?
"
"3533","That peace preaching pale clown drenched in makeup at the end looked a lot like Adam Lanza... Just saying."
"3534","I don't mind background checks or anything like that. But usually the ideas talked about affect law abiding citizens as well, like UBC. And yes, a gun does make it easier, but there are many things that would be easier than a knife. Like bombs. Yes, accidents happen with firearms but they aren't as common as accidents fires or drowning (can't post link in here but if you want I'll send you a PM of it). There will always be accidents, but I don't' think banning the weapons stops the hate."
"3535","*cough* sandy hook *cough*"
"3536","Yeah- imagine if they didn't have any? Oh, the carnage."
"3537","true, but there is no need to make it easier for them. And its a lot harder to do a mass killing with something like a knife than it is with a gun. Lets also not forget that a lot of shootings also happen accidentally in the home, bought by people to protect them from the bad ones."
"3538","THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING HAPPENED ON DEC 14 2012 BUT THIS VIDEO WAS UPLOADED DEC 5 2012."
"3539","Bad people will always have ways to get weapons."
"3540","Butthurt"
"3541","And if people never had guns to bring into gun free zones?"
"3542","Even though the majority of them happen in gun free zones?"
"3543","Doesn't making a top 10 list seem a little disrespectful? "
"3544","It's a good thing America has all those guns to stop these things from happening.

Oh wait..."
"3545","Marilyn Manson doesn't get enough credit for how good of a person he really is. His stage presence and who he is as a person are two very different things. A child is not to blame for their choice in music, nor their interpretation of the lyrics, its the parent fault for letting them listen to such things in the first place. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR FUCKING KIDS.
"
"3546","Giffords is not a top 10 in US history thats discredits the whole list..DC snipers should be 2nd and Columbine 1st"
"3547","We need to concentrate on Psychiatric care not gun laws "

"3549","This makes me want to be home schooled :/"

"3551","Calm down bro, he's a troll."

"3553","obamas brother on the right!!!! 1:14 hahaha"
"3554","why?"
"3555","no they dont you cunt! games are supposed to vent out your angers!"
"3556","This video was posted about 9 days before the Sandy Hook Shooting."
"3557","hadn't happened when they upload this..."
"3558","Cause they dont to blame on guns"
"3559","video game violence has nothing to do with real word viloence"
"3560","Sandy elementary school shooting?"
"3561","Because people want a scapegoat for their piss poor parenting and simply because they don't like others enjoying anything that doesn't interest them so they have to shit on everything."
"3562","lol the crazy part is i see no white people talkin no shit about these guys bein a waste of a human being nd a scum to earth.. bt let them show some black people doing crimes it would be all types of dumb shit on the comments... because they white yall blame it on video games,lol yall white folks contradict your selves so much its a dan shme.. "
"3563","ya my parents do that"
"3564","With your logic your a faggot to for responding to his comment in the first place and starting the whole argument. See the issue here?"
"3565","blame the games ? why dont blame the law ? see the differences here ?"
"3566","You kids must stop playing these violent video games! there to blame!!"
"3567","Yeah.. I stopped going to those, I only go to marathons now...


I know.. Im a ass hole."
"3568","people with Deidara as an icon cant be a faggot"
"3569","seriously they should stop blaming videogames and start doing something about the fact that weapons are to easy to get!"

"3576","ment the N64 game :P"
"3577","You miss that one that inspired The Boomtown Rats to make ""I Hate Mondays""."
"3578","Um... what? xD lol

I'm not 100% sure how to respond to that. Are you really that stupid and childish? Jeez, lol. xD"
"3579","I like how they put ads on this video. Profiting off the death of others, very smooth."
"3580","bullshit! fuck off you little pussy!"
"3581","the movie is my favorite Bond movie but i played the wii Goldeneye and i loved it"
"3582","true"
"3583","So you put this video up on Dec 5th right? The Sandy Hook schooling happened over a week after you posted this video. So WTF? How did you know bout it on the 5th when it happened on the 14th."
"3584","people cant blame video games because video games arent the only  products that display violence. u still have violent movies and music"
"3585","just get the fuck out and dont even try."
"3586","the fact that you responded to me about wat a frankly dont give a shit about just means you are a fucking faggot. nice paragraph bro it might go on the fridge. "
"3587","violent video games made them kill people :))"
"3588","whaaaat?? wow lol she blamed the nuggets.."
"3589","it's kinda overated =P"
"3590","If i hear one more person blame violence on video games then i am never going to the massacre convention (school) ever again."
"3591","it is stupid about how they whine about COD and such but do not say a word about South Park"
"3592","ok
i wish i could play Goldeneye but atleast i saw the movie"
"3593","R.I.P. For all how lost ther life's under this shooting's. Hope them all are in a better place."
"3594","remember, this was when Goldeneye was ""lots of blood"""
"3595","yes but my favorite game series is Assassin's Creed but i just became an 12 year old on 13 april so i honestly dont care about kids playing violent games but only if they dont brag about it"
"3596","the best quote i heard without acknowledging our past we are destine to repeat it so true"
"3597","Chciken nuggets causes mass shooting... This Bitch"
"3598","If in all U.S. history than what about The Boston Massacre? Unless they mean when it was a country like 6 years later?"
"3599","-facepalm- Um, I'm only generally speaking. 

Media always blame video games and you wont hear them say a thing about all the violent movies and television shows that're out there and are easy for kids to watch.

Not that I'm blaming either of them, I just hate the hypocrisy.

The fact that you don't understand that I was only generally speaking and got all defensive is pretty funny though. A little slow, aren't you?"
"3600","I agree"
"3601","totaly agree, but think about it: 18+ games is really easy to obtain, so children (Not in Sandviken =D) can easely buy them.
beside, 99,9% of all the games has some degree of violence =P
hope you read all of this =P"
"3602","I grew up in northern Virginia and I was there when the sniper attacks were going on.  I remember my mom being scared to let me stand out at the bus stop."
"3603","but its dumb to blame videogames because not all of them are violent! alot are not violent!"
"3604","so more families play video games instead of watching movies?"
"3605","armed citizens have obviously failed make a difference though.
you dont need to be a criminal to get a firearm. we all have a hint of insanity inside of us turning a normal person into a murderer. each citizen could become one."
"3606","when movies does the same thing?
well, videogames is more in famelies"
"3607","I know I play video games and they don't want to go out and kill because of it. However when I watch current affair programmes that show politicians and the wealthy screwing over the average Joe and getting away with it that gets me really pissed off. But hey them video games yeah they're to blame not the fact that societies laws give them assholes a free ride whilst screwing the working man"
"3608","The reason why all these people killed is the same: They're a bunch of pussies who are far too self-centered to ever realize that they're not the only ones in the world with problems."
"3609","Besides, criminals are criminals. They're going to find a way to obtain firearms anyway. So if we talk about stricter gun laws, what we're actually talking about is disarming the citizens of their right and ability to defend themselves. We're not actually talking about disarming criminals, and the facts prove this beyond debate."
"3610","Correction, four times as many."
"3611","Gun laws have nothing to do with it. People need to start researching things for themselves instead of just becoming pawns of the media. Statistics prove that stricter gun laws do NOT reduce crime. Compare Chicago and Houston for example. It's much easier (and more legal) to obtain and carry a weapon in Houston, yet Chicago has 3 times as many homicides a year. For every one criminal act involving a firearm, a couple hundred people defend their lives with one. The media just doesn't report that."

"3619","That background music is so relaxing!"
"3620","I have no idea why...
"
"3621","Any killer who survives one of their Mass Shooting sprees should be executed!"
"3622","Same here. At the time, I lived in Ashland, Virginia were they shot someone at the ponderosa steak house. Very scary!"
"3623","why would people blame violent video games when without access to firearms, it just couldn't happen."
"3624","I lived in VA during the sniper scare. It was fucking terrifying, still brings back bad memories."
"3625","the school shooting happend on dec 14! how did u know about that on the 5th!?"
"3626","dont forget that his music is amazing"
"3627","nu weet je dan jongen"

"3629","4 min 30 TALOR SWIFT"
"3630","I believe they do it because we are in control of the games."
"3631","blame the war"
"3632","wauw ik wist niet dat animal crossing gemaakt was om mensen te vermoorden"
"3633","i don't know. because they ""take the role of the killer and think it's a video game""."
"3634","oh my god get off the fucking bandwagon already, and do something about it if u care about guns so much. jesus christ if i ever have to see another comment like that ill stab my head with a SPOON and give u something else to compare and talk about."

"3646","Animal Crossing made me contemplate suicide."
"3647","fuck you! do you even know how ina-fucking-propiate DC Comics and Marvel are?"
"3648","if they blame videogames they also blame Animal Crossing"
"3649","People blame Violence in Video Games and Movies, like are kids allowed to play these games no."
"3650","because they're stupid"
"3651","the reporter did mention violent ""movies"""
"3652","You aint got shit dick wad."
"3653","because the media uproar blamed goth culture, music and videogames for their motives, some time later it was confirmed the kids werent even goth or marilyn manson fans"
"3654","Why do some of these guy mostly have brain tumers"
"3655","Why marylin manson ?"
"3656","why do people blame violence on videogames?"
"3657","Because WatchMojo is a Youtube partner and makes money based on revenue from ads. Are you really this stupid? Besides, if you're smart, you can block those ads."
"3658","Did they ever find a motive why James Holmes shot up the movie theater? "
"3659","CHICKEN MCfucking NUGGETS! the cause of a shooting what a stupid way to sue"
"3660","Go fuck yourself"
"3661","They are a partnered channel, meaning they are contractually obligated to have ads on every single video they put up."
"3662","Why do people always blame things irrelevant to the shootings? If games were a problem why don't we hear about people shooting others every day? Millions of people play stuff like CoD yet 1 person with a serious mental problem starts killing people & it's the fault of the game? Maybe if people didn't buy their 5 year old little bundle of psycho an 18+ game there'd be less of a problem"
"3663","You really don't make yourself look intelligent or mature in the slightest when you use terms like 'batbabies' and feel the need to say 'shit' every 4 words or so.

Your post did give me a good chuckle though."
"3664","Why do people blame violent video games, but not violent movies? =/

It's not just stupid it's hypocrisy."
"3665","you think content means anything to advertisers? you clicked this video for entertainment.. in exiting for entertainment, you must watch commercials. what don't you understand about that?"

"3668","Dang a lot of these shootings happened in Texas..."
"3669","who would've thought that next to the top list is Sandy Hook , a week after this vid was published. "

"3671","This guy knows what the fuck he's talking about. The gun laws aren't the problem. If we outlawed guns, these killers would use explosives. If we outlawed explosives, they'd use machetes. It's the killing INTENT that is the problem, not the weapons themselves. The real problem was these men were raised by single moms who failed to teach them how to be men and take charge of their relationships. GET YOUR BALLS BACK, MANHOOD101. COM"

"3677",". . . I can't really consider it my government, I actually am from Sweden. plus, that's a conspiracy theory no-one can really prove if it was the government. As of right now all we can say is for certain is that it was a terrorist attack. That's all there is to it as of now. "
"3678","I have to agree.  As some one who had to sit by and watch a friend lose his mind AND be powerless to do anything about it I can say the mental health laws need to change to weed out people like that and get them the help they need.   Also, in cases where they do this stuff to make a name for themselves or for attention their names and images should be withheld from the public and never released."

So it's a catch 22.  Truth is, people are going to kill, no matter what you do.  All we can do, is be aware of situations to get out of the line of fire.

If you are going to post the photo of one killer first, then roll the story, post the photos of ALL the killers first then roll the story.  Who's the killer of the first mass shooting?  I would never know, but I sure know the face of the sniper because it's posted.  Why is that ALWAYS THE CASE?  Show them in normal photos as well, not crazy ones, what needs to be said is these are normal people at some point. People need help."

Can u imagine all they had to go tru by bullies? how tormented they felt and lonely. I KNOW. So no pity for these bullies, schools don't force the rules, take action. simple and understandable.

"3830","Well no one wants shootings to happen. These steps your are talking about have been taken before and did not work. As a matter of fact, they were a colossal failure. Think of it this way, where would a armed criminal most likely start a rampage, the place that has a sign that say ""gun free zone"" or the place with the sign that says ""staff in area are armed and will use deadly force if needed"". Both places exist, and guess what places have more crimes? The gun free zones. Who would have guessed."

The word assault weapon was coined by the liberal media so they can demoralize any weapon that they see fit. People who agree with these dumb ass democrats are ignorant and stupid. Not saying you are but people fail to realize that banning these so called ""assault weapons"" won't do jack shit, the only thing it will do is take the lawful citizens guns away. Question, do you know why the 2nd amendment is their? "
"3834","I don't live in an area with lots of gangs. I do however know several people who the columbine shooting strongly effected. I've talked to them and they say that it makes them sick that people like you think teachers of all people who try to not promote violence carry a fire arm. Also no one in my neighborhood owns a gun and we haven't had any crimes is like 15 years. And if I don't keep responding to you just know that I unlike you have a life and need to do more productive things than argue."

And if u say no i find that highly unbelievable, because i've never heard of a place where shootings happen somewhat often and there being no gangs. The majority of gun crime in this country comes from gang related shootings. And if u know them up close and personal please do me a favor and move to a neighood were there are no gangs. A place where normal citizens have guns, thats the place were u will find less crime."
"3842"," A 1982 survey of male felons in 11 state prisons dispersed across the U.S. found.
• 34% had been ""scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim""
• 40% had decided not to commit a crime because they ""knew or believed that the victim was carrying a gun""
• 69% personally knew other criminals who had been ""scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim""

 The facts surrond us. You just have to look.

I live in an area where shootings happen somewhat often. I know them up close and personal more than you probably ever will. Having more guns won't just solve the problem completely.

"3847"," Ath the sandy hook shcool, Victoria Soto, 27, moved her first-grade students away from the door. The class room had no closet or anywhere else to hide The gunman burst in and shot her, according to the father of a surviving student. Six students were killed in that classroom. If Victoia Soto had a firearm She could have possible stopped the gunman and saved those kids lives. Why cant u people see that a gunman would no longer target shcools if they knew teacher's had their own source of power."
"3848","I don't think a class room full of children getting killed is a good think in fact it's tragic. But I think if a guy could kill a cop he could kill a teacher. If the teachers are quick on their feet and able to get the kids into a closet or something than the killing would be less likely. I mean a teacher would have less training and there fore not be as good with a gun as a cop."
"3849","Well how is a class room full of defensless children getting killed  a good thing? And what was to happen if the bad guy was able to kill the only shcool cop? Once again we have helpless teachers and kids. Thats why it would be smart if teachers had their own means of defence. Remember cops dont show up until after the killings."
"3850","Ok but how is a guy getting killed at all a good thing? I mean I support the second amendment fully. I have no problem what so ever with US law abiding citizens having guns whether it be a hunting rifle or shotgun or a pistol for self defense but I don't think a teacher armed with a gun is a good idea. I think if the school has a police officer with a gun that would work. But face it more guns isn't the long term answer. "

He would go into the store with his gun barking orders and threatning to kill u, and at that moment he would see everybody else with their gun pointing right in his face. He would either leave or lights out for him. 2. He would see people in the store had a way to defend themselves and go to where people didin't."
"3854","Only cops should have guns. Guns should be rigged to automatically explode if anyone elses hands touch them. Hunting rifes should dis-arm themselves the moment they leave the hunting grounds. Guns should be equipped with bright lights and subtle sounds so we know who is holding them. "

"3882","You have a good point. Guns aren't our only problem. There are many sick people out there who will kill people no matter what the cost. I don't think we should take away guns. I mean a knife is also a deadly weapon. And like it or not guns are part of american culture. And the black market dose pose a threat. We can't stop it fully. And I never said ban guns all together I just don't think a person needs a fully automatic assault weapon. I have no problem with a hunting rifle or shot gun."
"3883","Hey I don't want a fight. I agree we should stop spending money in wars we don't need. Now you are right that banning assault weapons won't fully prevent school shootings but I do want to take steps to help lower the chance of tragic shooting. I mean we can all agree that we don't want shootings to happen. Can we fully stop them from happening? No but we need to help reduce the chances of another shooting from happening."
"3884","Joy is right. Banning the guns isn't going to help. With where the black market is today people can still get guns. If we ban guns, then when someone is threatened with one how will they protect themselves. Guns don't people. People kill people. Take away guns people will still kill with whatever they can. If someone is set out to kill, then they will not care what they use to do the deed. I am not afraid of my government. I am afraid of the people who will do whatever they want when they want.
"
"3885","you're a special kind of stupid, aren't you?"
"3886","What about that ""dark knight"" movie theater massacre?"
"3887","Banning assault weapons will not prevent shcool shootings. If u ban assault weapons they will just start using powerful handguns. And then u guys will want to ban handguns. How about tell your new socialist government that you all trust so much, to stop spending money on wars we dont need to be in. And instead spend it on something useful like putting security personnel in our shcools. And perhaps have teachers have a concealed carry. "
"3888","I agree that we should ban assault weapons and have better background checks."
"3889","Hey I don't think we should ban guns all together but we should have better background checks. I mean do you want another tragic shooting? "
"3890","Tragic how just 9 days after this there was another tragic shooting"
"3891","why is everyone fucking retarded :(   (the killers)"
"3892","Bingo. Well said."
"3893","And it would have been absolutely horrible if the Nazi's would have defeated our military, and then came over here to our country were all of it citizens would have no way of defending themselves. And especially if the only thing we had was muskets."
"3894","Where did you get the idea that you couldn't?
 You can buy an RPG under the National Firearms Act as a ""Destructive Device"", following an FBI/BATF background check and the recipt of a 200.00 tax. My uncle owns 2 RPG'S. He's able to because he is a law abiding citizen with no criminal background. Anyway the AR-15 and assault weapons are a more effective tool for killing. It would have been kinda hard for us to defeat the Nazi's if our troops only had RPG'S and gernades."
"3895","9/11 wasn't that bad in the big picture. you know nothing of what happens around the world."
"3896","i know 9/11 was bad and out of this world, but 9/11 doesn't happen everyday."
"3897","Columbine is given way too much attention & because of it other shootings have emulated it where the people wear black (va tech guy) and play out their ""basketball diaries"" fantasy for attention then KILL THEMSELVES. But the craziest and most  ""impressive"" snipers of all time were (imo) Charles Whitman who had a ""one shot, one kill"" idea and he just did it!  No movie fantasy.The 2nd scariest is the San Ysidro shooter.Whitman and Huberly were out of the blue-no reasons.Oh, yeah & cops Killed 'em."
"3898","lol it's cool, dude, I'm just trying to push your buttons a little bit. The most important thing to remember is for the left and right to have an open dialogue on ALL issues. The country is very divided right now, and both sides need to give a little to iron all this shit out. I think it can be done, with some patience and common sense from both parties. I understand the second amendment and its importance, but let me ask you, if I want to own RPG's and grenades, should I be able to?"
"3899","fuck all thies pepole they are going to hell forever and some are"
"3900","True our country has high statistics on gun crime. But not all of it comes from shcool shootings. The majority of the stats comes from gang related shootings. True banning guns will lower gun crime. But it will increase overall crime. Rape,burglary,theft,muggings, etc. Banning guns will only strip good citizins their right to defend themselves. Britain banned guns and their overall crime more than doubled. Criminals will always find away of getting firearms. There are more good poeple than bad."
"3901","lol wut?"
"3902","it wasnt a massacre the definition states u killed ppl who could not defend themselves the americans had clubs "
"3903","Hey shut up its not her fault ppl like u are OCD Screw off"
"3904","The day that all you democrat ""socialist"" liberal's (joydivsion77) are succsesful in destroying your own second amendment, and disarming the american people at the extent of killing millions of  law abiding true patriots who refuse to give up their weapons.

"3907","I don't know, bob, but something needs to be done. Banning assault weapons, beefing up background checks are a start, but I think the problem may lie with the fact that this country is just gun-obsessed. People like Lee King, who exercise ""their constitutional right"" (I'm so sick of that rehearsed phrase) by owning weapons for self defense because they think their lives are somehow threatened by the government, blacks, Mexicans, etc. I do think over time education can change all of this."
"3908","that's not the point, lee. you need a car to get from point a to point b in your normal, everyday existence; and I couldn't care less what substances someone puts into their body, they're only hurting themselves. i'm pretty sure you're a racist as well, but at this point it's just a hunch. Lee ""Tea Party"" King...yeeeeehaaawww!"

"3919","Well Im going to remember our little debate to when a man comes to a mall with his stock pile of guns, and trys to shoot up some people and i blow his ass away before he gets a chance. And i will think to myself wow alot more of these mass shooting would stop if more people would exercise there right to have a concealed carry."
"3920","Ok. By the shear volume of your posts and their content I can only surmise that you have some problems. You can bring up quotes from the 1700's all you want, but it is a different world we're living in my friend. I'm going to cease and desist with this senseless argument because neither of us is going to change the other's mind. However, when I hear that Lee King of Anytown, USA has snapped and shot up a mall somewhere with his stockpile of weapons, I'm going to remember our little debate."

"3926","First of all I'm absolutly suprised to hear any american say they would rather be defenseless in a hostile armed situation. ""Arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self defence."" - John Adams. If the founding fathers were there believe me they would have at least attempted to shoot at the assailant with there muskets. ""I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery."" -Thomas Jefferson. But u would rather run for the door like a coward while they all die."
"3927","Wounded knee massacre ??? 300 died ??"
"3928","No, I would not be more comfortable having a gun in a situation like that. My number one concern is getting the hell out of the theatre, not blowing away the assailant.  Remember, the 2nd amendment was written at a time when people were armed with muskets, not semi-auto weapons, some with 100 round capability! An amendment is precisely that, a change, and it needs to be altered (and improved) to fit this new nation of 500 million+ people"

"3932","I think you forgot the words ""so hard"". Your insult loses something without them."
"3933","Just because there are criminals we should not lose our constitutional rights.  Its our second amendment for a reason. Early americans and the founding fathers knew from personal experience how important bearing arms was. Let's look at some history. Adolf Hitler(dictator) banned guns, joseph stalin(dictator) banned guns, Fidel castro(dictator) banned guns,Chavez(dictator)banned guns. And look at how big and controlling there government is when they know there citizens are armless.  "
"3934","What if that day your friends and loved ones were in the aurora theatre.Wouldn't you feel more comfortable knowing if they had there own gun to protect themselves.Or just be helpless sitting ducks like they were.
The founding fathers gave us the second amendment for a reason.Its to protect ourselves individually, and from oppressive government. Its people like u who would not have stood up and fought for americas independence. "
"3935","What about the wounded knee massacre 300 deaths ???"
"3936","lol, when i saw your screen name and avatar, i was certain i would not be getting an insightful answer. why do you like guns so much? this goes out to all you gun lovers out there. why do you feel you need them? for protection? how many times have you actually needed a gun in an intense situation? for me, my family and everyone i know, that would be 0."

Around the age of 20 to 30 they recive military style gun training and afterwards they keep these heavy weapons in there homes.They basically all have guns and concealed carry.This country has virtually no crime.In the 40's not even hitler dared to invade.He knew very well that a country with mainly all of its citizens armed he would have sustain mass casualties.That's the true power of citizens with guns."
"3945","I believe the answer to 90% of americas mass shooting gun violence could be solved if the government would help promote, support and honor the second amendment by helping law abiding citizens get government coursed concealed carry classes thoughout every city and town in america. Not only would it help protect you and your family, but it would also create a more unified national security force through its common citizens.
  "
"3946","Good for the woman standing up for the second amendment at 4:25-4:54.Just imagin that day at the aurora shooting if most of people in the theatre had there own concealed carry.James holmes would have walked in started shooting,and every body in there would have pulled out there own gun and blown this mother fucker away!!.Im sure holmes would have thought twice about going there if he new people were packing there own."

I do agree that guns like rifles require some safer precautions, but every law-abiding citizen should at least be able to carry a handgun for protection."

"4066","Yeah or else the USA would have a huge number of homicides like all these ""unsafe"" countries with gun controll. Do you want to live in fear and agony like e.g Canadians.
* sarcasm off *"
"4067","a mentally disturbed american is more dangerous than any al qaeda terrorist."
"4068","Yes, true, very true, there is some merit in what you say. I suppose it's a very difficult & complicated issue, to tackle (let alone fix). Look I know there will always be egomania in our western societies, hell the western world was built on that, but we do definitely need to be generally speaking more civil & kind to one another. We need to stop the kind of bullying that can go toward contribution to these horrible events. We have the tools, we're not 3rd world, so we should know better."
"4069","Are you serious, you think a few mini fucking submarines could take over a country as densely populated and big as Australia? Someone needs to get some perspective. "
"4070","I do think that is when it really starts effecting people, when they go home and have no support. But I also think a large part of the problem is some kids never learn proper social skills, therefore never being able to improve their situation and just letting it get worse and worse."
"4071","Second Amendment, nuff said"
"4072","banning guns is the stupidest shit i ever heard
we need guns for protection
"
"4073","American government said in an interweave ""You don't need a AK-47 to defend yourself or your family, it has to much ammo and is to dangerous to carry around, Buy a shotgun"" 
How about we stop creating guns"
"4074","good thing I chickened out and didn't use my 45 when I was in hs "
"4075","Yes you have some great points, but they way some of these kids & a lot that I witnessed growing up was pretty much soul destroying. Non-fucking-stop harrasment (like these bloody facebook kids) beatings every second or third day at school & after school, like on the bus home. Being humiliated & demeaned by the opposite sex & also (and really most importantly) further bullying, abuse or even just plain being ignored in the homstead. ThisI IS a textbook breeding program for psychopathic behaviour"
"4076","Honestly, I've always been part of the ""popular"" group, so I never really experienced bullying. That's not be said that I was never made fun of, but I usually shrugged it off and ignored it. But I also think that kids who take bullying seriously just aren't dealing with properly, so to fix the problem I think instead of always teaching and punishing those who bully, I believe we should also deal with the bullied (not in a negative way, of course) so they can learn to deal with it properly."
"4077","Moron *shakes head & facepalms* you obviously don't know the full story behind the Sydney Habour assualt....do you? Or did you go just look it up on wikipedia? They were midget class subs, shrimps. 2 of them got sunk, before the 3rd only sunk a ferry ship. Barely enough of a fleet to take over OZ, let alone Sydney ahahahaha. They were after you ships haha. And the fleet subs that came after, barely did anymore damage than the shrimps. Anyway, I've had enough of conversing with dimwits. See-ya :)"
"4078","not shit sherlock it WAS in america read the title LIL BOY!!!"
"4079","i think fight gang fight gang wars bullys school shooting war will never stop u cant stop it if u wanna stop it u better get a bigger gun bc so far now china making nukes korea wanna nuke somone america is going down the drain the world is fine but the human race we know it is geting close to the end. things happen bc people dont even know what there doing to you to me to everyone the world thats why things happen "
"4080","O-P-E-R-A-T-I-V-E,  C-A-N-Y-O-U-U-S-E-I-T-I-N-A-S-E-N-T-E-N-C-E.  If it was not for Americas military your country would be speaking Japanese.  The only reason Australia is here today is because of American Military O-P-E-R-A-T-I-V-E-S-S-O-S-T-F-U.  At least elbaseh1 had something to say.  "
"4081","Ok that is 3 out of 10. So the other seven were bullied kids.  And you know these kids were all bullied how?  "
"4082","The military always hurts innocent people. American military has proven that. Shredding Iraqi farmers to death, from a gunship. And that's why I feel for the bullied kids, because the fucking bullies just get away with their behaviour in the end. Because bullies were victims of these school shootings, their pre-massacre behaviour gets completely looked over in favour of the shooters actions. But how do you reckon it got that outta hand in the first place? We need to deal seriously with bullying."
"4083","Well I guess most of them would've joined the military because when they first realised their problem they would've wanted to deal with it without hurting innocent people. With bullied kids, well I'm sure they just wanted payback or were resentful of the world. "
"4084","yes, I glad you are one the few too many Americans who know what the issue is. Good on you. If there were more level-headed Americans like you, the world would join along and cheer you guys to become great western inspiration that you could be :)"
"4085","True true. If the American government actually spent time looking into fixing the problem, instead of mourning for roughly a month, we make actually make some progress. Most of these psychos are either ex- military with psychosis or little kids who got one too few hugs so they walk around with a chip on their shoulder."
"4086","5:44 was that real??"
"4087","Yup. AGREED 100%"
"4088","I think your getting it :) And thankyou for responding in a civil manner. As I said I would love it if the U.S came together, healed (properly), saw what the underlying-deepseated issues are, corrected them & became the once great nation I once saw it as when I was a lad. Anyway, take care & stay safe!"
"4089","Yyyyyyeeeeessssss....That's what I've been saying all these years, Jimmy Savile for No.1 
"
"4090","Yeah, you're not far off the mark. Sad world, hey? You don't see Syria or Iraq's 'top 10' mass suicide bombers. Or Mexico's top 10 biggest shootouts between the Cartels & Polic. Or Africa's top 10 mass casualty ethnic cleansings. They all have humility. "
"4091","You're not reading it right sonny, the statement reads 'all shooters were EITHER...' Either being the operative word. Do you know what operative means? O-P-E-R-A-T-I-V-E, look it up"
"4092","...America but somewhere along the line, most of Y'all lost your way. You cannot deny that, most of the outside world & even your own are seeing the bare truth. Look at all these Jesse Ventura videos, now he's a TRUE great American. He's something to be proud of. If I had someone like that in my country, I would be re-patriotic. And I'm not ignorant little one, I've visited your country twice for a total of 2 & 1/2 months....I saw what I needed to see to make my own judgements :)"
"4093","....of light, hope, change & soverance. You've earn't this title through bullying other lands & 'big brothering' the world. So PROVE IT! And don't attack OZ, because frankly I don't give a shit at the end of the day. If I had enough money, I'd live on an Island somewhere. It's quickly becoming 'the 51st state of America' because of the shitty influence of people like Gaga & Minaj. I'm definitely not patriotic, I'm a citizen of the world. Don't get me wrong, I love the orginal idea of building..."
"4094","Hahahaha you think by throwing in an attack about Australia (that doesn't make sense by the way) is going to get me to see things the way you think are correct? Ignorance is rife in OZ, I've known this ever since I was a little lad being labelled a WOG or DAEGO. Even though I was born here. The whole western world is very ignorant, hell the whole world is. But the west is 'civilised' and prosperous, we should know better. America, who claims to be superior, should be the leader & beacon of...."
"4095","cool man and i understand what ur saying they prob should reconsider the ""top10"" part of the heading ""worst10"" fits the bill i think. its a shame these crimes happened so this video can be made. take care pal."
"4096","on your profile picture, is that a ship from eve online or something?"
"4097","no it was in aamerica"
"4098","Columbine was in australia, wasn't it?"
"4099","Jimmy savile for No 1!"
"4100","yea lol, Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold and the Virginia Tech guy all served atleast 4 years in the militairy at 17 years of age. well actually the virginia tech guy was ex marine."
"4101","No no, the reason they're fucked in the head is that they have had enough mass shootings to be able to pick and choose a top 10.
"
"4102","That is a stupid statement.  All the shooters were either ex or serving U.S. military (STFU)"
"4103","i'm sure they're gonna do an update soon....you think the americans should have learn their lesson a decade ago eh? shitty gun laws."
"4104","If you weren't as ignorant as you sound, you would know that all the ""Top 10s"" video series on youtube weren't for entertainment purpose. Many of them also serve as an educational source, not just to enlighten mass murderers and show off video games. But of course you wouldn't know that, because THIS is why Australia was a Penal Colony."
"4105","where's the sandy hook shooting when all those children died?"
"4106","its really cool and funny "
"4107","Yep no agruement there buddy. I mean it also makes you think why anyone murders or rapes. Rape is a crime of hate (self & perpetuated) serial killers were children once. Children, while maybe a little different or weird to all other kids, were bullied & harassed relentlessly for years. Like I mentioned to the other bloke, alot of bullied kids go into the police & army to use power. You gotta understand this, to understand why there is such UNNECESSARY horror & violence in our western societies. "
"4108","I know & I realize it's a reminder but if it adds nothing to the resolution or hinderance of future tragedies, then what exact purpose does it serve? I'm actually interested, because kids who were too young to know can get the information from publications in libraries & independent media broadcasters. One thing I can gather is all the shooters were either ex or serving U.S military (not a big surprise) or bullied kids (much of who end up in the military)."
"4109","I was watching the previous top 10's like, time travel films, alien races in films etc...then clicked on the next recommened video. Just don't believe this serves any purpouse ar all. It's not trying to achieve anything, I mean just listen to it. She's just spouting of the 'facts' and general outline of these tragedies. I do understand what you're trying to convey & I respect that, but they really shouldn't just repeat the stories for exploitation purpouses. Nothing will change because of a vid."
"4110","ban guns now. they're bad. and I'm not just saying this becuz of what happened in sandy hook. fuck sandy hook. even if sandy hook didn't happen, there'd still be another 11,000 people killed by guns each year in this country."
"4111","yes"
"4112","It's amazing how one man ca effect thousands or millions of people"
"4113","You seriously think it's just as easy to commit a mass murder with a knife as it is with a gun? Making guns tougher to get will make it so that people with problems will not only have to search low and high, but pay a hefty and if they do caught, will still get a hefty prison sentence."
"4114","Don't take this as defending US media (I'm Aussie), but I don't really think this was for entertainment value as it was for maybe, I almost want to say educational value, or maybe just as a reminder of dreadful things that have happened over the years. "
"4115","im just saying i really dont think any1 not even americans are fucked up enough 2 see this as entertainment. i mean its not the only show/program about the ""top 10"" disasters. ppl watch them out of curiosity rater than amusment. i knw thats the only reason i watch it. 
      y did u?"
"4116","No it's mentally fucked for commiting them, allowing them to keep being commited & the cheap tacky programs like this who use the phrase 'Top 10'. They are not paying tribute or raising self awareness, they're just 'counting down' which is entertainment. Raising self awareness would be done in a bullet point format with situation & outcome presentation, through a reputable organisation. These people are another E.T. And if they raising awareness, who to? 15 year olds who CBF'd learning the issue"
"4117","like Al Roker is responsible for it raining too much???"
"4118","Wtf? ""Ten most infamous U.S shootings"" but this title is a bit sinister. And btw, va tech had more deaths and casualties, why is it lower on the list than columbine?"
"4119","Marylin Manson is responsible for columbine"
"4120","i dont think this video was made 4 a purpose of entertainment but instead a source of education and awareness. i agree america is mentally fucked but 4 commiting these crimes not 4 documenting them."
"4121","This is wrong on so many levels. But it's America, people will tune in and watch."
"4122","Yes, yes, you are correct....but this sort of tasteless cash grab & so forth does not help. I mean, you don't see countries like Russia, Germany, Spain, Italy, China or Japan using stuff like this as cheap entertainment value. I believe that's why, generally speaking, the children in those countries are usually more well adjusted. Respect their elders, get along better as a whole community & aren't part of the 'ME & NOW' generation. "
"4123","And thank god (or whoever or whatever) that you dealt with it in another way :) I'm so sorry you had to go through crap like that, I used to hate seing smaller or weaker kids get picked on. I used to defend them, when then would get outnumbered or when they used to refuse to stand up for themselves. I also feel sorry for these kids who felt that this was the only way to deal with th problem, that it had destroyed their life that badly :( Innocent victims AREN'T the only sufferers. Everyone loses"
"4124","Takes a bit more than a YouTube mistake to do that."
"4125","NNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!"
"4126","I like how they ignored the massacres performed by the government on it own people, much higher than many of the ones mentioned in the video."
"4127","@1:14 IT'S OBAMA~~~!!  OMG,"
"4128","That's right....society & in particular the bullies"
"4129","All I'm pointing out is, you don't have to forget the tragedies infact embrace the memory (not that the message is really sinking in to your general public with numerous mass shootings later) and do everything you can to make a positive difference. But why is it acceptable for a pop culture entertainment shows like this & ET (one of your most empty & scandulous piece of shit excuse for a show your country has ever produced) to air things like this, but a serious film can't show the Twin Towers?"
"4130","Yeahhhh...NO. This show is not political correspondance, they should stick to what they do (the worst) which is ""who's your favourite super villian of all time..."" I'm pretty sure this braindead slut host didn't put herself through 6-8 years of media & political studiesYa don't see CNN or ABC news hour counting down top 5 sexiest RnB peformers. These idiots should stick to what they're paid to do. No matter what you say, this IS tacky."
"4131","Capitol hill massacre 2006 seattle, wa. Rip all."
"4132","Because this is not entretainment, this is simply a reminder tthat this is not the first shooting.
Wether we like it or not, this shootings are now part of the history, and as is very know, we must study and learn from history... or else we are doomed to repeat it over and over again

PS:check over, the category is news and politics"
"4133","WHY mojo why this is not entertainment its serious"
"4134","This was before the newton school shooting"
"4135","WHATS THAT YOU CANT HEAR ME OVER ALL YOUR FREEDOM AND FUCKED GUN CONTROL "
"4136","Remember kids, if you want to be cool and be immortalized on a top 10 list on the internet, then all you have to is kill kids. -_-"
"4137","Top 10 Over Dramatic Individuals on Youtube"
"4138","The guy on the left at 1:18 the first person that came to my mind was barrack obama"
"4139","What is the guy who caused the sandy hook shooting watched this and it inspired it... "
"4140","Ummmm....My issue with this is, *AHEM*, how the fuck do WatchMojo think this is entertainment material? Counting down the top 10 child & innocent bystander murders?
What's next? Top 10 most successful Genocides? Top 10 phedophiles with the biggest victim count? Top 10 mass casualty natural disasters that happened in 3rd world countries? You see, this IS why the U.S is mentally fucked."
"4141","Not that what they did wasn't wrong, but most of the time it is not the actual person's fault, and very few have done it just for attention. All of them has psychological problems not recognised but the government and think it should be treated at home, not in a government/medical care building. "
"4142","@NaftaliRa I don't know who he is but I hope what he said at the end shut them up!"
"4143","only an idiot blame Marylin Manson for Columbine"
"4144","all of these people are cowards. They shoot and kill people to get attention. Most of them dont want to take responsibility for their actions and kill themselves. "
"4145","LETS BAN MCDONALD CHICKEN NUGGETS!!!"
"4146","lol the chicken nuggets made my husband kill people LMFAO!!!!"
"4147","it's not about the music, games or movies people listen to and watch, or else everyone would be shooting everyone, it's about what's going on in someones' life and how no one does anything to make things better, we just ignore "
"4148","People need to realize that ignorant parents and teachers are to blame in these situations. Failing to realize that some of these children have a moral lack of character, and a fading scence of reality. And no one seems to think that some of these people idolize the radical actions of another like minded individual and obtain the courage to carry out a shooting spree of their own.    "
"4149","Why?"
"4150","Columbine was on April 20, which is Hitlers birth date. Many think it was a an act of Nazism "
"4151","where are the kids then!!
"
"4152","Sand hook wouldve been first."
"4153","its just a reminder of how life can change in seconds.Its not like its the end of the world just because this video was posted."
"4154","it only had 2 deaths and 9 injuries.it wasnt as bad as any of these."
"4155","best quote ever about columbine at the end. Thanks Manson"

"4165","3:26 22 dead 19 injured. Those damn nuggets!  GIVE ME MONEY!!!! "
"4166","They may have updated the description afterwards.  If you do that it still says date of upload "
"4167","it didnt talk about it in the video they just put it in the description. They were just saying their thoughts and giving condolences "
"4168","theres nothing racist in that statement"
"4169","why does this say ""published on Dec 5, 2012 and talk about the Newtown shootings, when those happened Dec 14, 2012...9 days later"
"4170","you know what 
i taking my words back 
you are not Racist 
you are a Fucking Pussy
shut up and be polite 
Bitch !!!! "
"4171","This video was made before the sandy hook shooting"
"4172","Thats was an stupid excuse from an even more stupid so called human saying that Chicken McNuggets can make someone kill lot of people. 
I hate that stupid woman. "
"4173","where are the COPS ??????????????????"
"4174","It was a stupid question,but i'm kinda angry that when something happens in Europe(or anywhere else) People just forget it after a short time.But when something happens in America the world is ending for them."
"4175","Unfortunately, yes. Mainly for political or religious reasons though. Americans just do it because its Wednesday...."
"4176","personally i love canada (my ex girlfriend was is canadian) and you know what i mean when i say LOVE!"
"4177","isn't it a little fucked up they're couting down shootings? just like how they counted down assassinations?"
"4178","Everybody here in America likes Canada, we also just like joking about them. As well as we like joking about every other country."
"4179","Alright, listen here you American fuck, Canada has the lowest crime rate, Best job finding, and less poverty! It also has great town councilers.Nothing is wrong with Canada! (No offense to other Americans but faggets like this piss me off)"
"4180","So Chicken McNuggets make people shoot a restaurant, thats why they call us a dumb country"
"4181","Yeah i get why you cried but i cried when i heard mrs Todds story why did she deserve all that punishment because of one mistakeD=.Bulling should be a crime for all who have been bullied like me =(
 "
"4182","Video games don't create Killers, their actions and personalities do."
"4183","we had this big presentation at are school about the shooting at columbine it was called rachels challenge i cryed so hard it was so sad"
"4184","Any Infamous Mass Shootings that are not in the US?"
"4185","Am I the only one that thinks is a little bit strange to rank mass shootings?"
"4186","Yeah that's not racist mate."
"4187","don't be Racist 
this shit happens Everywhere 
"
"4188","You called Americans retarded because of this...... since this video was made by Canadians, you just made a fool out of yourself."
"4189","What in the name of god, country, monarchy, theocracy, and a onion rings am I reading?

You expressed your idiotic opinion and now expect me not to criticize it simply because it's your opinion? How am I post to respect a ninny like yourself if you can't even spell 'you' correctly? Please, do me a favor and make sense."
"4190","Weird idea for a video"
"4191","A little condescending dont u think!!, lets not lose sight of the fact this is only opinions and what i said doesnt represent or express my whole beliefs on this matter as i DO agree with some of what u have said. Besides not everyone is peace loving in Britain, Blair went to war to get his hands on the oil ;) lol  its all about having power at the end of the day, whether it be politics or owning a gun! it sickens me the way people have no respect for one another these days "
"4192","'virtually non-existant'
Because you have absolutely no problems with gun violence and no one would shoot you in Great Britain. Everyone in Britain is a peace loving angel who would never repress freedoms with a government more then willing to take those freedoms away just to protect you.

Its not like there are muslims somewhere more then willing to kill you or something. Now my little angel, just sleep and dream of British Utopia."
"4193","same difference ennit lol
"
"4194","but that wont happen will it as i live England!! Gun crime is virtually nonexistent here compared to America, im not saying its THE cause of violence of course im not, but it sure cant help matters surely!  Theres so many factors involved with this sort of thing, its not as cut and dry as ban guns i know that. At the end of the day, why do we need guns in the first place!!! i suppose what im trying to say is: WHY CANT PEOPLE JUST LIVE IN PEACE. "
"4195","You know what.

The next time a rampant murder with a gun bursts into your house, I would love to see you throw gun control papers at a criminal and see where that gets you in life."
"4196","and the aurora, sandy hook, and virginia tech shootings were inside jobs"
"4197","the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun"
"4198","What people don't do is to THINK OF THESE CONSEQUENCES before taking action. When doing it, think about people you know or think of ur favorites, so that you don't rage or kill someone else. We human beings have a mind, but there are people (NOT everyone) who don't think twice before shooting. I may be angry at times, but it's feelings and emotions that can be talked about in school, at home, or anywhere else. I know that I have to make your read this entire list, but that's all I have to say."
"4199","I could also reason with you, if someone had a gun other than the shooters on those days. There might not have been any deaths except the shooters...... You cant use these as examples to ban guns. Many have also been saved by the right to bear arms......"
"4200","It says they live in Canada........... "
"4201","You're cute."
"4202","The fact that Americans have made a so called "" Top 10"" murders video says it all, retarded fuck wits!!

"4214","ok im done with you. so you are saying the government killed innocent kids and adults just to take away people's weapons? I pray nothing like this ever happens to you or anyone you know before get your head out of your ass and face the facts."
"4215","you know exactly what I mean; MP5, AK-47, ACR e.t.c are military style weapons that civilians should not have in the first place. period! there are no use for those type of weapons on the streets."
"4216","if we let them take away those guns it will lead up to eventually taking away all guns, what they should do is monitor who is able to buy those weapons the criteria must be more strict because people kill people not the guns, bro aurora and sandy hook are staged"
"4217","no im not saying take away all guns, that would be crazy. take away weapons that civilians shouldn't have like assault weapons, snipers e.t.c. "
"4218","Only in America. Must be a proud proud country"

"4233","I doubt Marilyn Manson had anything to do with this all but okay.."
"4234","But what would happen if they bashed someone's head in with a hammer, tire iron, or just fist. 
So much for gun laws... now were going to ban Assault Hammers, Assault tire irons, and Assault fist. Anything that can kill is going to have assault put onto to it and scare people into banning it.... 
Or you can have a gun and shoot the fucker who is trying to hurt you."

"4238","In the University of Texas Tower shootings it was reported that Civilians opened fire on the tower before police arrived, there are the heroic armed civilians weather or not they were the ones who achieved the kill. However many people are afraid to use guns on others even to protect other because they are scared of consequences, and i agree that it is a right to own arms and not automatic weapons that could in the hypothetical kill many unarmed civilians, but taking away those"

"4244","people kill people not guns, if u want to kill someone , u will do it no matter if u have a gun or not, if u dont know how to defend yourself , u gonna lose , no matter if u have a fucking gun, instead of worry if people should have guns u should look for ur childrens to dont become like that."
"4245","That's a first,,the Chicken McNuggets made him do it. "
"4246","having more or less guns it will be the same. you have illegal gun trades. you have the government selling guns illegally which leads to more deaths. and the funny thing is that when people die from other countries by the us government the us could give two fucks about them. and when something happens here we got fucking laws going through america is a fucked up country. having less guns is cheaper because illegal gun trade gets more money the US doesnt care about kids getting bullied "

"4263","Shouldn't this be called the Top 10 FAMOUS mass shootings? Mass shootings are one of the many things that make this nation great. I know of no other nation on earth that guarantees it's citizens the right to murder each other in the Constitution. Wowee! What fun!"
"4264","Video games make us violent? Your ass is getting a blue turtle thrown at you"
"4265","only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good one, and even if they took up guns, the bad people ( some of them) dont have licences so they wont be taken up, so then mass shooting rates will go down, but the ammount of people killed in each will skyrocket"
"4266","""but they couldn't do anything unless they can get their hands on weapons"" Oh ok, I'll go tell the people that to the 198 people who died in the Daegu subway massacre in 2003 in Korea that the guy who killed them is totally harmless because all he has is pain thinner and no gun."

"4268","Automatic guns are heavily regulated by the Hughes amendment to the Gun owners protection act of 1986. ""Where were those heroic armed civilians during that time?"" Sitting defenseless in ""gun free zones."" Please do some research before you spread your uninformed opinion. "
"4269","Yes a right to own arms, not a right to own a weapon that would outright kill and terrorize unarmed AMERICAN CITIZENS. An armed civilian with automatic fire power against a unarmed populace causes a massacre. Where were those heroic armed civilians during that time? How can you be sure that if they were armed that psychopath wouldn't have killed them taken their weapons in a planned assault. It is so easy to blame the criminal of the massacre. But would it happen if he never had access to guns?"
"4270","i'm so sick and tired of what psychos do being blamed on video games. i've been playing shooting games since i was 7 (now 20) and not once have i thought, ""oh man this looks so fun. i'm gonna go on a rampage and kill people"". "
"4271","hahaha americans and their fucking guns look at canadas murder rate compared to the us gun control is effective "
"4272","there were also the school shooting at Newtown, CT."
"4273","I HATE THAT THEY CHANGED THE GUN LAWS... this is America! WE HAVE A RIGHT TO OWN A F*CKING GUN AND CARRY IT. IN THESE SITUATONS... IF MORE PEOPLE CARRIED THEM... LESS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. "
"4274","Hahaha what? No, who the fuck carries a gun to school? Are you saying there should be SWAT teams on standby in every classroom so you can protect yourself from a mugger? Stop making yourself look stupid. I was proving the point that guns are impractical for protection in the USA today. Could wait for the police to come....after 10 kids have been killed, or you can have it like in other countries, disarm the madman with a knife who injured one person."
"4275","As long as you think like that idiots and psychopaths will effectively have the ""right"" to kill your kids, your family or anyone else you give a shit about. yes, it's the fact that the person is mentally fucked, not the gun, but they couldn't do anything unless they can get their hands on weapons, like you can in America. It's quite simple really, as long as your gun laws remain as they are, innocent kids will die because of one person who has a few issues."
"4276","thats how stupid you people are the most deadliest mass murder ever was at wounded knee almost 300 men women children mostly unarmed where systematicly killed by the us army so much for your reporters knowledge of hystory educate yourself on your own history .shame on the us army.
"
"4277","Or delegate that cops shouldn't just wait outside a school before everyone in it is dead.. I've seen countless of videos where there's a school shooting happening and all the cops do is surround the perimeter waiting for the suspects to either kill themselves or kill everyone in it. There's even some cases where they wait hours on end before they go in. There's no reasoning with psychopaths. just go in and blow their head(s) off. "
"4278","No guns = safer environment. 
But even then people that truly want to do a mass murdering will still get a hold of illegal firearms anyway, even then there would still be a dramatic deference ..

More guns = safer environment.
If everyone had a gun then how likely is it to stop a person from actually committing such a heinous crime onto society? You'll most likely kill the perp before he commits a mass murder.

What i think you guys need is gun control. Run background checks, get licenses, etc. "
"4279","You can use guns in fucking war e.g during the liberation of America, but for everyday use, for idiots to use as well? Haha it's a fucking joke. Guns enable the massacres, could columbine have happened if they couldn't get their hands on guns? there have been many crazy kids in other countries brandishing knives at school in other countries, but nothing happens, a scratch or two. Guns ENABLE the people to kill, get that through your thickshit skull."
"4280","honestly i think its videos like theses that FUEL others to commit the violent crimes they do. Since when was ONE SHOOTING GREATER THEN THE OTHER?!?!? those people who see attention so badly think ""dang. I will be infamous for this"" like seriously? I think the media should first quit glamorizing the killers and focus more on the victims... hardly anyone can name more then 5 victims of any of these murders but right on the spot people know the killer. PEACE AND LOVE EVERYONE. "
"4281","But it's the guns that enable the weirdos to kill normal people. You say guns can be used to defend against the weirdos? Where were the students guns to protect them while they were being gunned down by weirdos? What about the primary school children gunned down recently? Where were the guns protecting them?"
"4282","I was arguing with the idiotic justification of ""guns don't kill people, people kill people."" Or the idea of the 2nd amendment should be held strong even if it actually disadvantages people in the country. Even the idea of shooting a mugger is ridiculous. We may agree on restrictions (although I'm thinking your restrictions will be pretty lax) but we agree on little else."
"4283","This is America where school shootings are the norm. :)"
"4284","I LOVE ERIC HARRIS "
"4285","this was uploaded right before the sandy hook shooting"
"4286","Not true, if you ban guns they become a whole lot harder to get a hold of, even for outlaws. Other countries have done it, they have far lower murder rates. Outlaws can most certainly get a hold of more dangerous guns and also more of them if guns are legal. Your argument is illogical. You can also teach kids right and wrong as well, that would also help. The simple fact is that it has been done many times before in many countries and it works. It's not a complete ban, you can still hunt."
"4287","the solution isnt to ban guns. if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns. you teach the children that there is right and wrong and that there are consequenses for there actions, wich public schools are doing a shitty job of."
"4288","Dude, there are far less murder attempts when guns are banned. Many countries where guns are banned have far lower murder rates than america. In New Zealand, even the police aren't armed. Think of it as guns enabling murder rather than guns protecting from murder. It's much harder to kill a man with a knife, both physically and even psychologically."
"4289","Yes, the amendments were laid down a very long time ago, but times change and the law needs to change with it. America is very resistant to change due to their wrongly-glorified history, despite the fact that the old ways don't always serve best in modern times. You honestly think that you being able to save your wallet from a mugger should go hand in hand with allowing people to go on massacres? I'm not talking about banning guns outright, just no automatics or concealables and tough licensing."
"4290","wtf is with this person's voice??? it's like she's talking about the weather and not mass murderers !!!
"
"4291","how was this rated? impact on the media?
"
"4292","no but if guns are banned then we might as well make murder legal because there wont be a damn thing we can do about... i mean seriously if some ones trying to murder you your not going to tell them ""Please stop i need to call 911 so they can shoot you"" like thats gonna happen dip shit."
"4293","was right outside Blacksburg when the VT shooting happened, had a friend of a friend who was shot.... RIP to all the students who died."
"4294","I doubt that. Seriously....who competes in kills when they can kill eachother."
"4295","This was made 9 days before the Sandy Hook shooting."
"4296","But you're blaming a Youtube video that counted down (not glorified) the most well known accounts of mass shooting for being a potential incentive. If a mentally disturbed individual wants to commit an atrocity then he'll be motivated by his own agendas.......period. "
"4297","This is what's wrong... Videos like this, that glorify and rate murders based on who has the highest kill count only spurs on more psychopaths to compete with one another. Then fucking morons blame video games, movies and music for the problem."
"4298","Just because someone says its so, doesn't mean it is!"
"4299","So we shouldn't ban something simply because people will still do it ? Should we get rid of laws that ban things like murder since people still do it even though it is illegal? "
"4300","The people were killed with the guns... "
"4301","I don't play CoD. But it was still badass! FUCKFACE"
"4302","columbine is down on the list

Vtech owns it"
"4303","Badass? I guarantee you are a COD fanboy who has never even fired a weapon in real life, sure only 2 people were killed in that, but 18 others were injured, some permanently paralyzed. ""Shootouts"" as you call them are terrible things. What is so badass about that? Retard..."
"4304","How about the 1997 North Hollywood Shootout?! That one was badass!"
"4305","Uh... no The good guy could easily be taken out by the bad guy(s). Especilly if the good guy is outnumbered. Guns themselves aren't bad but they should be regulated. How would you like your kid or whatever to be shot to deth because some crazy got their hands on a gun due to us believing him to be a ""law abiding citizen""? Now I love all of our amendments so don't you dare accuse me of not loving my rights."
"4306","They also had automatic rifles, so that argument doesn't stand. You can hold a crowd at gunpoint, but you can only hold one person at knifepoint."
"4307","That's just not true. Where I come from, you wouldn't have a hope in hell in getting a high capacity clip, and even less hope of getting a gun to fire it. Go look it all up, the numbers are there. It would take a while for all the guns to filter out of US society, but it's a long term investment. Other countries used to have free-for-all gun laws but the change, although took time, improved things vastly."
"4308","In the case of columbine, they had knives equipped which they used to kill people, which makes your argument invalid @kro235"
"4309","People kill people, but guns enable them to do so. You can't go on a massacre without the high capacity guns available to Americans. It's not a fucking myth like all gun-thick Americans think, tight gun laws lower murder rates drastically, it's proven. America is slow to change (i.e slavery, womens rights, imperial system etc) but when you guys finally understand, you will change your outdated amendment,"
"4310","You are thick as pigshit, you can't go on a massacre with a knife or a bat. You might kill one person, but you could do that with strangulation. Anti-gun people want to ban enabled MASSACRES."
"4311","oh c'mon.
Shut up!"
"4312","Well said, my friend."
"4313","remeber, no russian"
"4314","Marilyn Manson real ass fuck lol..."
"4315","There's not much more that can be done with gun laws now. The laws that are there just need to be enforced. Those that are responsible enough & with the correct traing SHOULD carry! The more people that have concealed permits, the more likely a transgressor will think twice before engaging in their crime. These tragedies have nothing to do with guns but has everything to do with the individual behind the gun."
"4316","@zendlern AMEM!"
"4317","When people kill with knives, hands, or bats, people wonder whets wrong with the suspect!  When people kill with guns, people try to outlaw guns and completely skip the fact that the gun is what brought the suspect down too!  So to all of you anti gun people, fuck you!"
"4318","Someone should send this to the NRA."
"4319","I'd consider Sandy Hook to be ranked either #3, #2 or even #1 on this list if it were to be updated"
"4320","lol wut? Marilyn Manson was targeted by the media because the comlumbine shooters were both MM fans. And that was 11 years ago so... "
"4321","That is way off topic. Obviously the trend of this video is mass shootings and spree killing conducted by 1 or 2 people. Otherwise, there is much more than wounded knee that they missed.  "
"4322","Death is in are nature and so is people killing each other so how can u not see by now its normal. The government kills innocent people all the time for no reason but does anyone care about that "
"4323","what about the massacre of wounded knee? The worst massacre in american history..... Dose nobody give a fuck about that?

"4352","@welkijken That's not an accurate statement, American murder rates are average when compared to the rest of the world, (though to be fair we are higher then many other developed countries) in other countries like Mexico, many South American countries, Asia, and Africa murder rates are 5 to 6 times higher then in the US. So much so that when their people are massacred the world news rarely feels its worthy mentioning."

"4401","10 days later from when this vid was uploaded another mass shooting takes place at sandy hook, possibly the worst out of all of these ones."

"4411","You are pretty stupid by saying that.  Beslan school masacre in 2004, 380 people killed by Islamic separatist militants, mostly Ingush and Chechen.  there has been countless other cases all over the world.  America isn't even in the top 10 of the worlds deadliest countries when it comes to gun violence."

"4417","The Fort Hood shooting. How on earth did someone named Nidal Malik Hasan achieve the rank of Major in the U.S. Military? They have proven to be psychologically and emotionally unstable people. Why would we entrust tem in US military with weapons? Why not just allow chimpanzees to carry loaded pistols? Same thing. This was a ticking time bomb from the start. How could something like this wiggle it's way into the military? Change is needed. "
"4418","ironically this video was posted 3 weeks before the Sandy Hook massacre"
"4419","The title is deceptively used to ban firearms. When you look at the worst mass KILLINGS in america they were done without firearms. I'm referring to the murder of 168 people when the O.C. Federal building was bombed, the murder of 3000 people when box-cutters were used to hijack planes, and the murder of 87 people when the Happy Land Social Club was burned down by an arsonist."
"4420","A man took his moms gun and killed her, next think you know he shot two kids one survived the other was dead.;("
"4421","I've seen worst"
"4422","Exactly"
"4423","yep, thats probably the worst one I have seen"
"4424","I am not a US citizen, im from the UK so i couldn't own a gun legally if i wanted to, however i have fired guns on ranges many times, and i enjoyed it very much. It became a hobby when i was able to. Now in the UK i regularly take part in clay pigeon shooting (with shotguns). Guns are a tool of sport as much as a football it. It's the persons perception of guns that makes it what it is."
"4425","Have you ever heard of any mass shootings besides the ones in USA?"
"4426","Actually, guns like any other deadly weapon throughout history, make it tougher for you to BE killed. It's who had more guys left ALIVE at the end of a battle that won. Not how many the other side lost. 
Doesn't matter what somebody brings to an unarmed class of six year olds. They're dead meat. THAT'S what needs to be fixed. 
""The life GIVING Sword"" - by Yagyu Munenori. 16th century Samurai. Excellent research for the true purpose behind a deadly weapon. "
"4427","Exactly. One could just as easily claim there is no need to have a car solely engineered to go 200 mph when the law says you can't go half that. The thing is, I don't have to prove I NEED anything to retain my right to have it. It's perfectly reasonable to want an AR-15 just because you think it's a cool thing. It says absolutely nothing about you having any intent or desire to hurt ANYBODY. Focus on putting a little security around the kids, not anyone's rights. "
"4428","Guns are a lot more dangerous, largely because they make it so easy to kill. Humans, like most other animals, normaly have an instinct that keeps them from killing a member of their  own species. Even if it doesn't prevent violence (probably so natural rank fights can still take place) it still makes people hisitate when they are about to kill barehanded. Weapons like knifes already lower that hesitation but, because of they ease with which they kill, guns take it away altogether. "
"4429","People make the mistake that guns are tools used only for killing. A gun is no different than a knife in the sense it has other perfectly legitimate uses. People also make the mistake that guns are vastly more fatal than other weapons which is also not true.  Guns don't kill people, people kill people. (i quote :P) The only gun laws that i believe should be focused on, are gun safety laws. More injuries probably occur from gun accidents rather than actual shootings."
"4430","Exactly, and those states with stricter gun laws do not have lower over-al homicide rates. The only statistic gun control laws have ever lowered, were specifically gun-related suicides. More often than not, the overall suicide rate doesn't even decrease. Guns are not the cause of violent behavior, nor the worst tool they could use.

"4431","Nerver heard of the Port Arthur massacre in Australia I take it?"
"4432","Do the math. 

And Switzerland has more guns per 100k than either of them, including assault weapons, and a homicide rate of only 0.7. 
Gun don't make people violent. Simple as that."
"4433","I get really offended when I see a killer who's blaming it on islam and saying that they're religious. the quran says killing one person is like killing all humanity. and who ever kills on purpose gets killed. there's a hadeeth saying it's forbidden to even tutore animals (why we eat halal) and even tutoring an ant is wrong. how about a man saying he's killing for islam -.- crap !"
"4434","I'm willing to bet that armed robberies and hom invasions went up in those countries after the ban. Just look at Australia.  Armed robberies went up 44% and home invasions went up 300% after the gun ban.  WHAT NOW..."
"4435","Not sure this needed a Top 10 list. Poor form if you ask me."
"4436","However guns are often used in these events (mass murders) however gun laws will not simply stop that. After all, when did criminals start following laws. The only thing that gun laws can do is reduce the availability of weapons, however (coming from a person living in the UK), In stead of simply banning guns perhaps it would be better to ensure that they are being safely. Either way, if a person truly wanted someone dead, it wouldn't be difficult to accomplish with or without a gun."
"4437","Well that is how it looks to a person with your mind set however you should also look at it from another point of view. You can look it up, In the US, states with strict gun laws do have fewer gun related homicides (obviously), however the states that have looser gun laws generally have lower crime rates especially when it comes to home robbery which is massively decreased. And most murders are not committed with guns. If a person is going to kill someone then dont need a gun to do it."
"4438","The data on Honduras isn't invalid, it proves that being very poor is a factor in human violence. Which correlates more than gun proliferation. "
"4439","And Yet, The UK has more guns than Canada, and a lower rate. Also, 
Mexico 22.7 per 100,000
British Virgin Islands 8.6 
South Africa 31.8 
Greenland 19.2
Switzerland, with over 400k FULL AUTO Assault rifles in public ownership, compared to US where they're illegal, 0.7 per 100,000

If you're trying to imply guns CAUSE violence in human beings, you have to prove it across all humans. Honduras proves it is other societal factors you're just trying to ignore.

"4440","Why is VA TECH not #1   ???"
"4441","Either you're gnorant or snide/arrogantly stupid.  The title is simply stating that shootings outside of the U.S will not be counted.  If you point is to say that ""they don't have to include US in the title because we all know that mass murder only happens in gun nut land USA,"" then piss off.  Easily the netherlands would take the top spot if that were the case.  Or the genocides handed down by a single man in countries like Rwanda."
"4442","There has never been a CCW involved in a mass shooting incident - Exactly!"
"4443","good ol america lol"
"4444","Wow, this video was published a few days before the Sandy Hook shooting."
"4445","I knew the Columbine Highschool Massacre would either be #1 or 2!"
"4446","3:30 lol are kidding she was trying to say the chicken mcnuggets made him do it wow!"
"4447","I mean Countries"
"4448","But think of the population Usa Has a Bigger Population then all those states of course the death count would be higher"
"4449","I agree with that to a certain extent yes you should not be allowed to purchase a assualt rifle like a ak47 or a submachine gun that shoots 80 rounds per second as in the Mini Uzi but you should be allow to purchase a shot gun a regualr one round burst rifle as in a M14"
"4450","the title only had to say worst mass shootings, and we would know it was in the states.
"
"4451","Add Sandy Hook, R.I.P you poor kids you're with God now."
"4452","OH WHAT NO KILLEEN TEXAS TOO??? I WAS RAISED THERE!!! OMG COME ON!!!"
"4453",":O Fort Hood shooting!!! I was born there D: "
"4454","Could not agree with you more!
"
"4455","Honduras is a very poor and in the developing stage in terms of democracy.  One cannot directly compare here because of this - the data is less valid.
Gun laws are stricter in countries below vs the US - directly related to gun availability, and they share a more common form of democracy.
UNOC - Countries by Intentional Homicide Rate (per capita):
US - 4.2 deaths per 100,000
Canada - 1.6 per 100,000
UK – 1.2 per 100,000 
Australia – 1.0 per 100,000 
Sweden – 1.0 per 100,000

"4458","Weird how most of them took place in Colorado...."
"4459","You should be locked up and prevented from making stupid, ignorant comments such as this one. I know you'll probably cry free speech on this, but in certain cases the right to speak your mind should be revoked and your mouth stapled shut and your fingers cut off. All so that we don't have to read things like this or listen to unfiltered babble from morons like yourself."
"4460","right now Newtown School Shooting was the saddest."
"4461","Isn't it sad that someone who would be labeled as 'weird' or different is one of the few people actually worth listening to?  So many people let looks and judgement of others drive their motives.  Marilyn Manson could careless, so in theory he lives in a judge free world.  I personally think this is a great and rare quality."
"4462","WTF is wrong with you "
"4463","Marilyn Manson is an extremely intelligent guy, and quite mild-mannered. Hate his music and his style, but his personality is legit."
"4464","See in Europe guns are illegal, and shootouts are rare here.

NRA: oh you dumb European, don't you get it?
We need more guns for the ""good guys"" so the ""bad guys"" can be stopped.
hehe.. no more guns.. how absurd.."
"4465","Mine is in Organic Chemistry. I do research all the time. And you still haven't made up a reason why socio-economic status excludes Honduras, besides the fact that it debunks the biased conclusion you had before even looking for stats. Nor do the stats you chose track any correlation between legal gun ownership proliferation and murder rates. Your own sample doesn't even show that crime rises with gun availability."
"4466","9 days dipshit"
"4467","Even if we think its terrible people have always loved to read or watch stuff about terrible things or evil people.
Bad things are just simply way more interesting than good things most of the time."
"4468","Too true. And this is actually exactly a point that was brought up recently after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings."
"4469","Don't fucking ever disrespect someone simply because they live elsewhere."
"4470","what the fuck is wrong with everyone? the top ten? are you fucking kidding me? as if one was worse then the others. this is the shit thats wrong with our world. its not whether people are allowed to have guns or not its the fact that we fucking glorify the criminals as if they were some celebrity. this is the type of shit that makes the pussies want to top the list and do something to be remembered. "
"4471","only 9 days after this video was published, connecticut happened ): what a shame"
"4472","The ending made this vid worth it"
"4473","My degree is in psychology, and I have had significant experience with research and research data, including stats.  You might want to take a course."
"4474","OK, so if you have no idea about research and data, calling the stats crap really makes your point valid!  Oh, look I didn't even need to call you names to make the point!  Go back to your world of 'my opinion is right just because it is', and I will talk to someone who is more informed.  Thanks."
"4475","Canada provides for the US water, oil, timber, fish, and minerals and the USA does not pay Canada to establish these factories."
"4476","This must have been made before Sandy Hook :("
"4477","You are legitimately retarded. You didn't give us freedom, we asked for it and got it because we were smart enough to realize that you don't need to go to war to get it. We use protection from the US because we are allies dumbass and we know we don't have spend trillions of dollars on our army. But our men in the army are just as strong as Americans,we just don't have the population size to support the military you have. Canada stands for safety, equality,and FREEDOM."
"4478","these guys thought they were tough shooting out schools? they should have stayed for the lethal injection instead of shooting themselves."
"4479","if somone wants to massacre a whole school tighter gun laws arnt going to stop them, you can buy swords online for less than 50 quid a pop, anyway im just saying if somone is going to do somthing like this you cant realy stop them by tightning gun laws, they are either going to do it or not. and you can find guns in other places not only gun stores."
"4480","US then guns. This is a well known fact. So maybe we should all start walking  instead of driving? Dont cover something up with something else. Guns are not problem if used for wise things. Its people you need to worry about. You can expect anything from anybody!"
"4481","I am not trying to mean. My fiance  was driving home on new year, and some guys began harrassing her and driving crazy on the road. You can expact anything from strangers. Its society that needs to know how to treat others. A solution is needed like morals ethics, values. People are so out of touch with GOD satan has controlled peoples minds. You dont neccecarily have to be possessed like the exorcist to be controlled by satan. Satan is smarter then that. Car accidents kill more people in the "
"4482","99 One if someone broke into your home with a knife, or a harpoon...or a chainsaw what would you do?Attack him with a spoon? Seriously guns dont kill people. People kill people. If a person wants something especially a gun he can create things at home to kill you in a second.Banning guns doesnt solve issues. Its like methadone.It doesnt cure your addiction it covers it with another. So if you take away guns you are left with an insane group of people who will do whatever it takes to murder you!"
"4483","You make the rest of america look bad by insulting me based on where I live. Canada only produces the majority of the natural resources the States use, is a peacekeeping nation that the majority of people respect, we do not posses a trillion dollar debt (But i guess that comes from paying for Canada), we don't have nearly the troubles as the US when comes to discrimination, we are not completely idiotic about matters outside of our country."
"4484","Assault rifles should not be allowed regardless, but anyway James Holmes purchased his remington shotgun, rifle and handgun along with thousands of rounds LEGALLY! Is that not suspicious? The States do not have to full out ban guns, but they need to place a lot more restrictions on acquiring them."
"4485","A little help with the data and what it means:
watch?v=Ooa98FHuaU0&feature=player_embedded"
"4486","Only the US would have a ""top 10 mass shootings"" LOL. Soon to be top 100 mass shootings"
"4487","Exactly. Since when do criminals follow the law?"
"4488","thumbs up MM
"
"4489","2:01   Lets see, his name was Malik Hasan...Well you're stupid if you didn't think this guy was a muslim fuck ready to shoot americans. Why was he in the American military and issued a gun in the first place? And fuck you sympathizers in advance."
"4490","I agree 100% that the test to receive a gun should be more extensive, but they need to regulate the guns that can be purchased."
"4491","No, sweetheart, you're just trying to turn a meaningless factor into something important. You have yet to even try to explain how a ""developing"" society would throw off the stats. You're beat, because your logic was crap, and your own examples from the high-end of gun proliferation don't even track. Your childish attempt to save face won't hide it. Be an adult and re-examine your beliefs. You're just wrong. "
"4492","So you think people should be allowed to own an assault rifle because if that is the case, then there is zero reason to argue with you."
"4493","no"
"4494","I think a lot of people are afraid of the other side of that coin, which would be how many kids get caught in the crossfire. "
"4495","What that guy at the end said, those may as well could of been gods."
"4496","They Should Have Officers Patrolling The Schools Daily"
"4497","Why should you Make a top 10 about This?? WTF."
"4498","As far as school shootings go no one mentioned a change in school policy at all other than arming teachers or assigning cops.  Do me a favor and google Response Options Group.  They are a consulting group that is ""paid"" to limit casualties due to active shooters via policy and training.  Policy regarding an intruder is squarely fucked, just ask the experts.  Everyone who isn't qualified has an opinion which is great but of no benefit to anyone."
"4499","Wow you might as well take ever hunter's hunting license to huh? guns are not killing people thats what people like you need to realise the person behide the gun is killing to get a gun or to own a gun license you should have to go threw a strict test with mental testing as well as physical "
"4500","Dam right before Sandy Hook"
"4501","Heres a fun fact, most mass shooters in the US were young adolescents and adults who were put on mind-altering Psychotropic drugs often perscribed by their doctors and psychiatrists.
I don't see anyone rallying together demanding that we ban psychotropic medications. Its always the usual scapegoats."
"4502","Homicides by firearm per 100,000 for the UK is 0.07, the US is 3.0.
Gun laws make it more difficult to acquire guns for both criminals and law abiding citizens. More guns just causes more death and violence. Pro-gun people shouldn't be so stubborn"
"4503","He killed his mom and stole them from her, is that not illegal?"
"4504","The connecticut's shooter's guns weren't obtained illegally."
"4505","why did you make this video?? shame on you"
"4506","This comes from different view points, while I definitively see the advantage of more armed individuals where ever there are large groups of pepole. I dont know if it should be teachers, in Canada I'm not sure about the States, we have School Resource officers. Which is a RCMP member who does 10 of his 12 hour shift at the school, this provides a person who is not only armed but very well trained, a well trained weapon is better than one thug with a grudge."
"4507","OK, you obviously do not understand data or comparative values or validity so there is no point in arguing it with you - it's sort of like arguing with an unarmed person - pun intended.  I didn't say 22 kids were injured in China, there were a few injuries.  Thanks for playing!"
"4508","Well, when this situation did happen in China, the teacher was unarmed.  There were a few injuries but no fatalities, including the assailant."
"4509","I don't think that was their intention, I think they meant to remind us of prior tragedies in light of the recent Newtown shooting. While they may not have executed it perfectly, I believe WatchMojo intentions were respectful. Also, I think you should've read the description. "
"4510","People are found in those scenarios still sitting in their desks with a bullet hole in their head. People carrying guns are still considerably more likely to shoot to scare as well. Drawing those weapons is a in the situations discussed is a skill drilled into those legal and armed forces people. While I think it would have made for a more interesting story, I doubt it would have made much difference. "
"4511","We should probably make sure that any changes stemming from these incidents are based on REALITY, not some hippie dream world where everybody loves each other, you can un-invent the gun, and CAN'T exist."
"4512","There is simply nothing about a developed or developing country that changes the circumstances. Crazy is crazy. You can't remove guns from the equation any more than you can people. Pandora's box is open, thats it. Prohibition never works. 
A guy in China was able to cut up 22 kids with a knife, could have killed all of them if he went for the neck, because NOBODY COULD SHOOT THE MOTHERFUCKER!!!! The bad guy's weapon isn't the problem. The absence of one to fight back with is!"
"4513","I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to be a ranking system, they probably put the ""Top Ten"" by accident"
"4514","Tell that to Joel Myrick, assistant principal at Pearl High School who used a pistol to stop 16 yr-old Luke Woodham during his rampage in 1997 - right in the middle of the Assault Weapons Ban."
"4515","The british we now know as americans"
"4516","What makes you think that armed teacher would even be capable of pulling and shooting? Even with a gun they are just as likely to pull a stupid face and do nothing."
"4517","wheres sandy hook???"
"4518","Americans: They believe healthcare will destroy society, yet guns will protect it."
"4519","The guns legalized are ridiculous. Who needs to ""protect"" themselves with an assault rifle. Just compare the USA to many countries where guns are illegal and you see the number of shootings in microscopic in comparison."
"4520","Actually you can't - according even to the most basic research procedures, it makes the data invalid.  You are absolutely correct about inanimate objects - now if we could just remove people from the equation, guns would be fine.  So, let's compare something else, how many people do you think would have been killed at Sandy Hook if the assailant only had a knife?"
"4521","this is what happens when you legalise guns to Americans.........trigger happy nation"
"4522","than dont watch you stupid fuck"
"4523","Oh yes conquistador is an oh so british title."
"4524","They aren't rating them. These are just ten of the most infamous ones."
"4525","Its informational and was made a week before. It doesnt glorify it "
"4526","Actually you can. Because Human beings are Human Beings no matter if their country is ""developing"" or not. And inanimate objects, no matter how dangerous, do not cause homocidal rage in human beings. The causes of these incidents, and what made them soo deadly were in their heads, not their hands. The researchable fact is that gun proliferation rates and murder rates dont correlate. 
Guns aren't the problem. Gun owners and advocates are not the bad guy. "
