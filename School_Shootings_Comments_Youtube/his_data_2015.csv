"1","in 14 years old but this teaching prepares them and I wouldn't lik it but I think it is a  class needed teach in school its frightening of course no doubt but if they had these I would feel more protected💖💖"
"2","We just usually hide under our desks - Instead in a corner is easier for someone to get Killed...."
"3","she is badass."
"4","So dumb these days I would push all the desk to the doors NO one would get in cause they can bust threw a door"
"5","When I have drills they act like its nothing and as soon as the alarm goes off the teachers tell everybody to hide, close the blinds, and the teacher sometimes just sit on the computer."
"6","What kind of fucking school does this shit as a drill. I would kick their ass if they did this to us as a dumbass fucking drill."
"7","So the news can argue that people can disarm a shooter after one training session AND
that concealed carry students have absolutely no chance whatsoever.
right."
"8","how about more than just two guards with only tasers to prevent theese school shootings ?"
"9","shi ima be real i would get the call of duty mentality and let generations of blood thirst flow"
"10","3:35 when you tryna fake cry so u dont lok lik u wana shot up de skewl."
"11","You ALMOST got a ticket when going 130?!?!?!?!?!?!? Holy shit!"
"12","Dang y'all they all jumped that shooter down the floora, dogg!!!"
"13","Lucky for me, my school has cameras at the door for the secretary can see who it is then let them in, other wise the other doors are locked with gun proof windows, and inside the buildings the doors to the classrooms automatically lock as soon as you close them, are school does this too, sooo yeah I don't think a Robery would happen at mine, extra good thing about it is that they rebuilt a new middle school in 2013, that's what I am in."
"14","What's it going to take for parents to pull their kids out of school?  This isn't ""live shooter training"", it's obedience training with trauma thrown in.  

Where is the evidence that these drills have ANY beneficial outcomes?"
"15","thats my school"
"16","Liberals are stupid and place too much faith in the power of the ATF to prevent illegal gun use if guns are controlled strictly.

Only conservatives are smart enough to know that no amount of enforcement can prevent criminal gun use. Look at the War on Drugs. War on Terror. Both epic fails. War on Guns? Sure to fail. 

So please stop being a dumbfuck libtard."
"17","What if the shooters learn how things work?.... what if he know what students will do?"
"18","These kids are all gonna get slaughtered when some1 finds them... especialy in a group, what safety practice"
"19","Fake blood! Oh lord!!!"
"20","My school did one of these. Though if I am honest it was a bit more realistic. But, it was traumatic and terrifying. The trauma impacted me for a couple years and I can still remember it in full detail. It didn't help me ""prepare"" because there is no preparation that can prepare you for someone coming in and killing a bunch of people. You act on instinct and if a real situation happened to me at my uni, I would still act on instinct. You should prepare for school shootings with lockdowns and verbal instruction. Just like you do with fire drills. I've never seen a school prepare for a fire or earthquake drill by actually recreating it."
"21","Its not that easy, I mean, the shooter can fire the gun and the training only goes as far as fighting back without the gun, what if the shooter try to kill the teacher?"
"22","Why are the teachers unarmed?"
"23","This type of drill is what desensitizes our society toward guns. Whoever thought this up needs a serious evaluation because they have no idea the way the mind works. Having drills of going through the motions prepares people, scaring them doesn't. If you are, or know of someone conducting drills like this, this is psychological abuse and you should NOT allow this for your child. Knowing what to do through repetitive actions will suffice. Anyone who has taken martial arts can attest to this. You are instructed on ""what to do if"" and even have sparring and competition, but they don't try to kill each other. It's called self-defense, not self-offense."
"24","someone juggled the doorknob during a lockdown"
"25","Duck and cover is back to stay."
"26","Hey! I have an idea... FIX YOUR GUN LAWS"
"27","ABC would advocate and support doing nothing and dying a frightened miserable lives...."
"28","glad there's practice and thought...too bad they are still teaching the kids to huddle up into one big mass target"
"29","3:25*"
"30","3:26 so you get a adams apple?"
"31","Please take a moment to look at this, at the very least pass it on 
https://www.generosity.com/emergencies-fundraising/rescue-task-force-needs-help/x/12197679"
"32","Just a prank bro!"
"33","This is just sad. Clean up your act America."
"34","Nothing like traumatizing our children from a very young age.... don't be fooled by ""preparedness"" meme that's being used to build the new ""security"" industry... thousands of school districts, BILLIONS of DOLLARS. FEAR... the ultimate weapon!"
"35","I like that they use these 'Combat-exercises' but they only take out pistol gunners. Yes, the chance is higher that the attacker has a pistol, but full auto SMGs or Rifles are possible too. You can't disarm him like that."
"36","Schools need drills like this. Hell, even have student actors wearing blood packs that they can pop when the blanks go off. Students nowadays just go in the corner and chat and check their phones. The way these drills are run now are far from training, they are just ""Cool, I get some free time during class.""

I'd volunteer to be a blood-pack-wearer or a mock shooter."
"37","this shows that you can never be to prepared so start practicing"
"38","we need drills like this"
"39","""No warning"" if it was real there would be no warning"
"40","Omg Holly Carpenter is my teacher!!!"
"41","UNDENIABLE PROOF THAT SANDY HOOK WAS A HOAX"
"42","Where I live in California, we have open campus schools..."
"43","I would love this"
"44","When they were butt fucking on the floor, the guy could have grabbed her leg and broke it in a matter of 2 seconds if it were real."
"45","guys I you ever come across this in real life, push there eyes in...and blind they ass"
"46","We have school stores, they should put them in their schools so they could hide in there."
"47","sam pepper pranks be like.."
"48","You know a country has a gun problem when you need to have school shooting drills. You cant stop pissed off mentally unstable white male individuals with the intent of self-destructive mass murder with easy access to guns defended by overweight sensitive hypocritical middle class white pill-chugging conservative christian families who still believe in the reefer madness and has BBQs before watching their football game."
"49","Columbine high school is bad there was a lock down where over 100 people were killed"
"50","This won't solve anything. what will help is if every adult working in the school is packing a gun..stop teaching children to play the victim and wait for help every time something happens. They have to learn that they are responsible for the safety of there own lives. We are raising a generation of idiots !! That only know how to do what there told and can't think for there selves."
"51","lol my school shooting drill is shit. all they do is to say we are in the lock down then we hide under the desk. Which I find it very bullshit how our lock down are very unrealistic."
"52","at my school we are in defense mode ok after Columbine my shool is really in defense mode . if a shooter came in he/she would have a broken rob or would have a injury. we lock our doir even if the doir was locked we would have our text books , book bags,etc ready to pounce . we would even use the chairs or desks . our shool is not that big ,but our bigest buulding id on LOCK DOWN . i mean they will even use the 1000$ insramints just to protect them selves"
"53","In the beginning, you could see the kids laughing during the second drill being shown. They don't understand how dangerous it could be and how in risk they are for shootings!"
"54","""At least 5 minutes"" MINES LIKE 30 MINUTES DAMN"
"55","Lol"
"56","But 30 min later they gave up and left"
"57","They had real guns they fired one thought the window"
"58","I've been in a real shooting befor and there were 5 shooters and our door couldn't lock so I was scared"
"59","#guncontrol for america now.how long will it take,how many deaths?"
"60","I am in high school, and we have lock downs, and it's so scary just to think about it."
"61","just the plain turn the lights off and lock the door drills terrify me and i get anxiety and stuff so if people came in and started fake shooting i would have a panic attack no thank u"
"62","if the us government would ban guns , 155 of those 160 school shootings (the 160 school shootings the media covered.....) could've been prevented..but oh yeah a 300 year old constitution (out of a time where automatic weapons weren't around may I add) is obviously more important to keep than the safety of people."
"63","This is just wrong"
"64","My school makes all hide by the door and turn off the lights so he can't see us.. For real do they think the gunman is gonna be like ""oh they're not here"". If I'm in class and there's a shooting happening, the rest of my class better get some chairs and throw them at him with me."
"65","I'm just saying but so do schools not realize shooters know in a lockdown everyone will get in a corner and turn off the lights? Like think of someone better please so I don't die if a shooting happens. Fr"
"66","Or you could ban guns"
"67","I think that  the  drills  are  good( because  it can  teach kids  how to  react in a  terrifying  situation) as  long as  parents  are  informed    so that  when  they  receive  text  messages from  their frightened  kids they  can  react in an  informed  way  my  high  school did lockdown  drills and  basically an  announcement  was made saying  that  we  are  going  to  go  into  our  C  day  schedule   and that  was the  sign that we needed  to hide    but  everyone  would  joke around  for the  most part because  we  knew it  was a drill . Just  to reiterate  drills  where  they  scare  the kids  can be  good  as long as parents know  when  they  are doing  them  that way  the  parents know  what's  going  on but the  kids  are convinced it's  real as  to  prepare them  for   something that hopefully never  happens  because  when  kids know it's  fake they  won't  take  it  seriously"
"68","Arming teachers with combat skills and kids with techniques to not get killed whilst AT SCHOOL!! Should be indicative that perhaps guns are not a good idea e.g. Australia."
"69","Train teachers and let them conceal carry. Problem solved."
"70","I know weird ways to take down shooters i know how to acess pressure points to immobilize them an get their gun try to take out the mag or use their gun against them"
"71","Nobody died at Sandy Hook.  These ""active shooter"" events are staged."
"72","these drills are fucking horrifying at my university. we have one-two a year, and we lock down for a couple of hours. they'll do announcements before it starts so nobody panics and calls the police, but other than that, they're extremely realistic. a volunteer from the theatre department follows the shooter around with packs of fake blood, and anyone who gets ""shot"" has to drop where they are and they can get the blood poured on them if they want to. it seems kind of fun at first, but when you're running down a hallway listening to gunshots (albeit clearly fake ones) and it's full of very still, bloody people? kind of nerve wracking."
"73","It's just a prank bro"
"74","Why huddle in a corner? It would be like shooting fish in a barrel!!!"
"75","we have lock down drills at our school but they dont tell us abou them so the teacher lets us sit in the lockers if were really skinny"
"76","hahaha they are throwing the ball at the.........the.......... bad guys or something"
"77","JUST A DRILL DUDE!"
"78","honestly if i was still in highscool id want to be a trained student and id most certainly want to help take down a gunman if thats the last resort"
"79","i think it is important to teach teachers self defense. school shootings have become such a problem"
"80","gun control is an extremely difficult issue."
"81","I remember when my school had a lock down and I was with a teacher in the library. she was new. we heard the code word for a lock down, and we just sat there. I was waiting for directions but she just carried on with the learning.  all I heard was people screaming and running and doors closing. it was only me and her in there. if there was an intruder we would died cuz we were right next to the entrance. I found it funny when I went to lunch and she asked what happened and the teacher told her a lock down. I looked at her like
""Did u miss the meeting about the codes"""
"82","Are you fucking kidding me? America has shooting drills? Omg. That just proves your gun laws are fucked."
"83","they need 2 do this 2 all schools. it might save lives."
"84","As long as there's bad guys with guns I want a gun. Personal defense can't and shouldn't be made illegal. But the government thinks otherwise. But that's why we have the 2nd ammendment"
"85","How about instead of practicing these, how about having stricter gun laws? Canada has stricter laws, and how many school shootings have they had in comparison to the states? Definitely not as many. We hardly ever have lock down drills because they are hardly ever needed. We might have 1 a semester maybe if the principle remembers, but hardly. I just feel if laws were stricter with guns in the USA, these preparations wouldn't have to be necessary."
"86","IMMA THROUGH A MUTHER FUCKING DESK AT THEM"
"87","My distant cousin did something cruel like this a few years ago. I'm glad that teacher from Columbine High School survived. God bless her heart."
"88","I agree that it's horrible we have to do this to protect schools, but honestly the world is a sick place and u would feel so much better if my kid went to a school that takes school shootings so seriously."
"89","All the comments I'm seeing say somethings along the lines of ""Americans so dangerous they actually have to have school shooting drills!"" well, it's actually a really serious issue. I'm in middle school in the US, and we have drills for every possible emergency scenario, and we have them often. for some, this is a really big deal. please take it more seriously."
"90","One time my school had threats against it and they didn;t call, and they didn;t tell us anything about it, and tried to get us to go on a normal day and we were all flipping out"
"91","What do they make them huddle in a corner? My school makes us go under our tables and pull our chairs in and stay as quiet as a mouse."
"92","i think it's good to teach kids this...what to do...where to go & how quite to be...think blood & fake bodies is way too much...teaching them lockdown is good...but thats a bit too far...ive heard a gun but never seen or been in a gun experience...but it terrifies me...i even cry around fireworks as i'm that scared x"
"93","And this is what you don't do when teaching about an active shooter."
"94","why would you put every single kid in the exact same spot I mean if a shooter came in then for 1 the shooter would spot all of the kids right away and for two it would only take a couple of shots to kill EVERY ONE because they are in the same spot I mean I know that some people shoot others for the thrill of it so they actually like it when it is hard to find every one ya know the whole "" give me a challenge "" thing but not that many people do it for fun they are either filled with anger or they are trying to be noticed so I really don't understand why you would huddle everyone up in the same spot can someone please explain the meaning of that cause I honestly do not understand that"
"95","Its sad that these drills even need to happen. America is the only place where a white person will try to shoot a bunch of helpless kids, and nothing will be done to help the security of schools."
"96","this is really stupid you're just giving future school shooters more information. They should jump at least the window its better having a broken leg than being shot to death."
"97","This is stupid because if the gun was real and he pulled the trigger she would bleed out"
"98","When we have lockdowns our teacher takes our phones if anyone has it on them and we just keep quite for a while. Then the principle and the police officer who hangs out around the school since I go to middle school and there are some bad kids at my school, anyways the principle and cop opens all the doors when we are done."
"99","I would bust a window and run, not wait there with everyone, then your basically sitting ducks, Ide rather die trying to escape than die while sitting there"
"100","We need more shooter drills then STUIPID fire drills"
"101","you send them to a chl class and buy them a gun"
"102","That drill was so uncalled for."
"103","My principle was at columbine high school when that shooting happened"
"104","as a high school student, I have gone through tons of these drills, but never have they gotten as morbidly realistic as this. There is not point in making it hyper-realistic if all the kids will do is sit in the corner and wait for the shooter to come in the room. That's pretty messed up."
"105","if you dont fight you die"
"106","I think the lessons on taking down a shooter is actually like a really good idea"
"107","Is that jenna 0:39"
"108","Omg it could be real too"
"109","This makes me sick. You are going to scare all these kids by putting them through these drills on the off chance that it might help them if something happens? How do you explain to a 10 year old why they need to do this and how do you prevent all those kids from feeling scared about something they probably cant do anything about anyway? I get it that people feel that schools should do something but you should also weigh the pros and cons and its a pretty big con that you are making kids face these things all the time and feel like a shooting might happen to them any moment now."
"110","just no just no stop we can solve every issue by letting teachers have guns obviously locked in cabinets or something just in case of emergency. or locked by a computer system that someone in the front office unlocks when they trigger the lock down. something not as stupid and cringe worthy like this"
"111","cringe"
"112","How did he almost get a ticket? He was going 130. He deserves a ticket XDXD"
"113","So my kid gets shot for lunatic right-wingers ""right to bare arms"". Right makes total sense."
"114","Am I the only one who laughed when she said her husband was doing 130"
"115","Thats a shitty drill it would be like shooting fish in a barrel"
"116","I would of cried and hugged the most unattractive guy in class😂 and probably shit myself. One time we had a drill ( dangerous person near campus) and a lot I f people knew about it and I didn't and I almost cried😂"
"117","6:13 hmmm niceee"
"118","police help!!!!!"
"119","TACKLE HIIIIIIIIIIIIM"
"120","7:22
of summer
No im not sorry"
"121","If minecraft was real I would take my diamond sword and kill the shooters"
"122","lol the students reaction when they threw the balls at the shooter made me laugh 😅"
"123","Wtf, hide and hope? Nah, here's a better idea: lock the door to slow him down and jump out the window"
"124","That shit never happens here. germany for the win"
"125","There were rumors in my school saying we're having a lockdown"
"126","Only Americans do this haha you people are sick. What the fuck is wrong with Americans shooting children in school? Would never happen in England"
"127","true"
"128","+Davine Nixon with"
"129","+Blake Mayhem we spend times qith both"
"130","If only they spent as much in literature as they did in defense."
"131","+SFMShorts XD mi auto correct tho"
"132","+Davine Nixon Holy shit that spelling is bad!"
"133","+Luisa Souza...therefore you are dangerous. "
"134","I think"
"135","would've*"
"136","because a guy won't shoot up a school because guns are illigal"
"137","Its hard down here, dude. i hate my country. why couldnt my family be born into japan or uk even."
"138","+Foouhomeyg yeah :)"
"139","+MyOwnPrivateAlex90s Amen dude."
"140","jump of the windows*"
"141","true ! like theres no fires that happen, ever !"
"142","I have fire drills but i live in uk anyway"
"143","I live in Georgia and of course everyone loves guns down here and we are fully capable of fighting back. In fact in my school our teachers tell us that we should hide behind the desk but if some one comes in the room we all have different jobs. For example my friend gets the box of scissors and I ready to throw I get about five text books and try to hit him in the groin or temple it all depends on my mood"
"144","For our school we do something similar, but different. We have a man knock on the door and yell ''ANYONE IN THERE?'' then leave"
"145","when you see a scene from your school"
"146","if we have a real shooter at our school I'm screwed bc we hide under our desk and I'm right beside the door......"
"147","jump out the window and run to the hills"
"148","This is in Pueblo Colorado"
"149","every school should do this"
"150","You lock the fucking door no shit sherlock."
"151","Wait, they don't even lock the fucking door?"
"152","Ban guns! Why Do Americans never Learn"
"153","you would think that the most effective way to respond to a shooting would be maximum chaos to disorient the shooter. Like play loud jarring noises through the loudspeakers and shoot confetti and rubber bullets out of automatic launchers concealed in lockers. Also like strobe lights would work too. Shut off all of the lights, except for random strobe light bursts.  And while all of this shit is going on, have a special police group that does all of there training in these conditions burst in and hunt and kill the shooter."
"154","When a shooting came to my school the thing is My dads family and my moms family is crazy so there is no need for my teachers to protect me so I will be going super crazy so good luck of who that person is 😈"
"155","Mass shootings=drills made to look real"
"156","Would you feel better with your children huddled in the corner waiting for the gunman to come in and kill them 
or

Would you rather they be huddled in the corner and the teacher positioned with a gun waiting for the gunman to step inside the room???"
"157","YEA scaring kids for life will help them 👏👏👏👏 
principle of the year right here 😂"
"158","This is so dumb you should be evacuating them if there's ever a shooting not put them in one corner"
"159","2:36 look at the boy in the background looking like he going to Disneyland or something"
"160","Fucking White Christians always shooting up schools."
"161","At my school we have a ""Fight or flight"" thing. We no longer do the ""duck and cover"" , And we just turn off the lights, lock the door &' sit in our regular seats, our teacher has ""wasp"" spray to stun him because they're not allowed to carry ""weapons"". And students are encouraged to help take out the bad guy in emergency. We're told to fight back in all cases, no matter what. Like in the video they threw things at the gunman, were encouraged to do that also. And if fighting doesn't work or something goes wrong, we run. (Multiple doors in all rooms) , we done it once before because a school close to ours had a gunman there & we were on lockdown for 2 hours , but it was a ""open lockdown"". We resumed teaching class, but the doors were locked and nobody was allowed to leave. Unless they're parents were there. I don't know what y'all think, but in my opinion ""fight or flight"" is a whole lot better than sitting ducks."
"162","So the teacher was in columbine during the shooting?"
"163","The school should tell the parents before the drill so they know what's going on"
"164","These teachers are sooooooo fine! Where do I find one? ?!!!!"
"165","To be honest I would be excited because of the lockdown. I'm only in middle school too. xD"
"166","Our orchestra teacher was talking to us during our drill one day, we have a door in the back of our class that leads outside. He said that if there is ever a real shooter and they aren't in the front area and parking he's gonna open the door and were gonna run. All of us were crying, we thought about how we'd leave all of our friends in danger but then again I'm pretty sure your friends will be the last thing you care about if you're in a shooting"
"167","It made me cry when I saw the sign that said Rachel joy Scott"
"168","this makes me happy that they are holding drill and training teachers and students but it is sad that we have to do this in the first place"
"169","Wow. My school is nothing like that. We do all huddle in the corner though. It's stupid, but I can't change it."
"170","Its awesome how skyview is doing an active shooters trainjng for teachers. it will really save lives someday"
"171","How Is It A Fucking Drill If You Don't Lock The Door Or Even Turn Off The Lights? AND THEN THERES PEOPLE GOING INTO THE CLASSES SHOOTING THE KIDS! If I Was In That And There Was A Shooter,I Would Fucking Start Attacking Him.
Excuse My Language. I Just Had To Share My Thoughts"
"172","omfg xD"
"173","try high school wood shop or welding those are the one class rooms no one goes to"
"174","Oorrrr... Instead of ducking in the corner and have the entire group of kids be shot up, there can be a presence of firearms!

What a grand idea! I'm such a genius!

NOTICE HOW EVERY TIME YOU DONT HAVE GUNS SOMEONE IS GOING TO SHOOT YOU WITHOUT YOU SHOOTING BACK!"
"175","i think this is smart but they should warn the parents."
"176","This Holly carpenter girl probably hates her 'kids'"
"177","They are basically giving people places to go shoot and the shooters will know what the have plan"
"178","Ew the school have ugly outfits for the class"
"179","White people smh"
"180","there's no winning if you did a drill your wrong you don't do a drill your wrong get over it"
"181","This can't happen in my school we already have a police station merged in it Jan Mann Opportunity Highschool"
"182","real 🔫"
"183","At my school most teachers have baseball bats and wait next to the door."
"184","😭"
"185","The kids that are huddled in the very corner are the safest"
"186","rolling on the ground tackling the guy the shooter pulls the trigger and kills a kid."
"187","did anyone  se that kid wave when they were showing the front of the school?"
"188","Truealerts!"
"189","130 whut by jeanally"
"190","they have done something similar to that"
"191","7:55 really the woman is the one to be by the door and try to take the shooter down?? (Lol I know it's just drill btw) but I know there are bigger and stronger men in that room that could try and tackle the shooter. Realistically, I don't think she would step up (I wouldn't either) lol. I think the throwing a bunch of things the shooter is a good method of trying to stop them, but the that means all of them are standing up and one of them could possible get hurt since the first thing the shooter sees is all of them standing up getting ready to chuck something xD so their instinct might be to pull the trigger.They should flip the desks down as a protective shield!!! Well a gun would probably go through that....but it will lessen the impact right? N they can hide behind the desk"
"192","Yo wtf this is crazy xD in my school, we do the same but they don't go crazy and use fake guns and a fake intruder. One time, they didn't announce that it wasn't a drill and we were like wtf they didn't say it was a drill lol. But this is pretty cool that they have the teachers do this training. I do think that it is pretty wrong to traumatize kids like this though."
"193","Idk maybe if the teacher had a gun and was trained!"
"194","This is a starts. School should always make a plan. And teach kids and teachers how to react when something like this happens."
"195","I can understand natural disaster drills, but a school shooting drill, really?! -.- I remember when I was in school they did a lockdown drill once. Lights were turned off, window blinds were closed, curtains covered the indoor hall windows, and everyone curled up in the corner giggling. I thought such a drill was stupid then and I can only imagine some moron thought, ""Hey they don't even take it serious, lets surprise them with a shooting simulation.""
While they are at it why don't they just start fires for fire drills, flood buildings for flood drills, place real bombs for bomb drills. 
smh."
"196","Why not just have the teachers carry a gun"
"197","Even if it does not help to hide in a corner, it does keep order."
"198","I would love if my school did this drill actually. Show those bitches what to do"
"199","tbh I would try to get something sharp hard or devastating and do whatever to kill him not going to die in a corner better chance if you go bezerker on them pencils in the eyes ANYTHING"
"200","If a shooter is trying to fight back and not get taken down he wouldn't just squirm.  He would punch you in the head, unrealistic training."
"201","this is actually a good idea. I would be scared in a drill like this but that's the point they should just notify parents and kids though to save the terror"
"202","also. A quote from my music teacher ""i think everyone should have the hardest thing in their hands and when the shooter comes in just pummel him by throwing everything at him but the kitchen sink and then some"""
"203","i know something that would be a lot better, have every teachers desk with a sawed off shotgun underneath with a release lever that only the teacher knows how to release it. it would make it 100 times safer then huddling into a corner where the shooter wont even need to aim he would just need to dump his gin in the general direction and probably kill the entire class. your just making it a lot easier for a shooter to make a bigger death toll."
"204","My school does lock downs just in case if there is a shooter in my school. sometimes I get scare at lock down and this one lock down we did not know about we all went in a concer in the class room I got really scare I thought there was really a shooter in the school I go to."

"206","For my schools evacuation plan (to be used in case of a bomb threat) they literally bring the whole school outside and put them in the stands of the football field. The whole fucking school. My district is so fucking stupid I want something to happen, just to show them what is wrong with the plan😕"
"207","Just a prank"
"208","oh yes because every school shooter knows and acknowledges the Ducking behind a Desk law. where if someone is comes in to a school with the intent to kill children all you do is duck behind a desk and pray he doesn't kill you. fucking seriously are people literally so stupid to believe this would work. the shooter would have cleared 4 classrooms before getting caught by the police."

"213","They might as well fight. If the shooter comes hes gonna kill you anyway."
"214","it's incredible that americans need actual drills for school shootings"
"215","What the actual fuck here's a fucking idea, get rid of the guns, you can't shoot someone without a gun, it's actually sickening that a western country would allow their children to live like that, it's the type of atmosphere you'd expect the children in Syria to have lived in a few years ago"
"216","Great now the shooter knows what the teachers are gonna do"
"217","Wait, the girl's logic was ""The police came and I'm scared"" (fair enough) and then ""I thought they were going to kill us!"" I'm sorry- not really getting it... Maybe she just didn't explain it properly, but seeing as she didn't even see any criminals, only police, I don't know why she thought she was going to die...."
"218","My five year old baby brother lives so close to sandy hook. My mother personally has sold beds to some of the family's an friends of the victims of sandy hook. I have this incredible bond with my little brother, and I would want nothing more than for the practices to help children of all ages. I believe schools should be doing more exercises often. My elementary and middle schools never did any. Only once in 6grade and it was a for real experience but I rather teach an save than have uneducated kids lay with fear.  So I hope schools everywhere can step up an do at least two lock downs a year and try to make kids understand how important it is. When my 6th grade class had one there were a couple kids that were joking around. It's not a joke. A joke could cost a life or thousands."
"219","I think there is another solution for your problem. If you just think a little bit, you might see it."
"220","I might join the police to take down these school shooting motherfuckers"
"221","What if the shooter has tear gas then they are disabled can't throw anything or fightback"
"222","#American problems lol"
"223","Ya wrestle the guy with gun it's not like its gonna go off or anything "
"224","hmmm maybe in the future, every class room in the building including the bathrooms and offices will have an installed metal locked down, bullet proof walls, doors.. oh and explosives won't do shit. so the plans are foiled for the ones shooting up the school. if they cant get to the people they are trying to shoot then they are basically there for no reason ether until they go away or the cops get there.. the metal doors can be open from the inside only.

yes, it does sound very very expensive.. but i think it could work.. maybe i dont know.. will it?.."
"225","WTF *pulls own shade* i guess theres no one in this room ill try the next
fucking stupid
didnt the fucking shooter shoot the door open?"
"226","if a shooter would enter my school I would stand by the door with a chair and knock the motherfucker out"
"227","Damn theres some cute ass teachers in that school"
"228","My high school made us lock the doors then pile all the file cabinets against the door and barricade us with desks all of our windows were at the top of a 6 foot wall. I really like that I wish they would do this in all schools."
"229","I wished my school would do more of these things :) they should be glad to be prepared"
"230","my school had a lockdown for 2 hours cause there were bomb warnings"
"231","My school has those drills a few times a year. There was one time when there was this Great Dane that sneaked in our school and they had a lock down. I don't know if it was a mean Great Dane or nice but it's good that we did the drill"
"232","TBH those drills look kind of fun...  Fake blood and volunteers pretending to be dead."
"233","Just teach the teachers Ikido, Turning oppositions aggression against themselves to over come and opposition."
"234","Ok. In most cases it is a pupil or student doing the crime. In which case they will know •if other pupils had training• what they are in for. But at the same time. There are many other pupils and yes. Some might be severely hurt in the process but they could bring the gun man down. Now in the case of a stranger coming in. The stranger probably doesn't know what to expect so it'll catch them off guard. Either way this is %100 safer then just sitting in a corner expecting them not to break through the door. They don't teach what happens when a gun man does come in. All they do is teach to sit in a corner and hope. Which does not work. So I do agree with teaching self defense"
"235","We have geese the that live on our campus and one time one got in and so we had to go on lock down while the goose was just waddling in the hallways😂"
"236","I just thought of a far easier and more effective way to stop a crazed gunman. Arm the teachers. Put a gun in a locked drawer of their desk. Make sure they know how to use it safely and effectively. Who's going to storm into a classroom knowing there's a person somewhere in there with a loaded firearm more than ready and willing to empty the clip into whoever walks through the door? And if that crazed person does decide they have skill to forcibly enter a room, find the teacher, aim, and shoot them before that teacher takes them out, chances are, the teacher (who only has to aim at the door) will be far more likely to stop that crazed person before any further damage is done. It's just common sense. 

Or, we could continue to allow crazed psychopaths to enter our schools, freely enter a room and shoot up everyone inside without any real threat of death."
"237","Jew-itt school... LOL!! Pretty ironic when you see how many.. er.. Zionist's?? Are involved in theses psyop events.. (Sandy hook.. Pozners, Parkers, Kaitlin Roige etc etc)"
"238","most people in my school don't take this seriously"
"239","Let it be known that in ALL schools there might be staff that is armed.
Highly unlikely that a shooter would risk going into a situation and have no clue who is armed and who isn't."
"240","Jewett is a pussy ass school lol #Clearwater"
"241","At my school we are told to line up against the wall. The teacher puts paper over the glass/window in the door -_-."
"242","""These drills may be too frightening"" lol you think a real shooter is going to ride in handing out candy on a segway?"
"243","That's actually a good strategy."

"249","And I just realized that that would probably never happen unless if the shooter came after school lol. Because all adults (teachers) would not be in a room together during school hours, they'd be teaching a class, which means that that method of throwing things would probably not work if it's a class full of kids :((( id hide my kids in the cabinet lr something"
"250","yeah but the guy wasnt actually fighting back"
"251","Because some mentally disturbed teacher will shoot a student and everyone will shit themselves"
"252","Ever since last year the lockdown drills have been changed by the state to fighting back instead of hiding. It might just be my state though."
"253","i think schools should take shooting drills more than fire because in fire drills u can excape but in shootings u cant at all do that"

"260","lmao it was such bull at the end. That man was trying in the slightest against the teacher. Otherwise he would have gotten his feet under him and lifted her off the ground."
"261","I support this, if a shooter manages to get into a classroom wouldn't you want your kids to be protected? As for enlisting the help of kids, if the shooter is outnumbered (were talking older kids not young ones) the chances of him becoming disarmed is higher. I don't have kids but I have 3 nephews, I would want their teachers to try and tackle someone if it can help protect them."
"262","some crazy fucked up guy can shoot the door open. schools should have a secret underground place to hide in while the police show up"
"263","Why can't teachers get a safe in their desk for a handgun. Have them trained to shoot and reload and clear a jam. Have teachers bring the guns home at night. I know I would rather have a gun during a scenario like this."

"280","It looked like they had a blast with the drill at least. We actually did a drill like that here in Canada but not that intense. More of like, code blue (or something), then we hid underneath the farthest desk."
"281","In 5th grade they called a lock down without saying it was a drill and  we all started crying cause we were hearing banging on the doors and it went on for so long"
"282","The reason you think us ""law enforcement types"" say don't be a hero, is because us ""law enforcement types have to worry about liability, and if we say what we are REALLY thinking, which is, TAKE THAT MOTHER FUCKER DOWN WITH A STAPLER!!!

"289","One time we went in lock down and someone started banging on the door but it was the pricible"
"290","Hiding in a corner of the room is like hiding under your desk during an atomic bomb drill. It doesn't matter what you do, you're going to die no matter what. If the intruder comes into your classroom you're obviously going to die because he's going to look around the classroom and find you anyway. Scaring kids into thinking they're about to die doesn't help them, it traumatizes them. I'd like to see a shooter go into a police station and pretend to shoot THEM up as part of a government drill. It's bullshit. If a shooter is in the building you open the window and get the hell out of there. I'd break the window with my backpack and run at least 2 miles before I even turned back to look."
"291","I feel like some teenagers at highschool are much more capable of kicking a shooters ass than the teachers."
"292","(Sorry in advance for the long post.) At my school, they recently instituted a policy of all emergency drills (fire, earthquake, and lockdown) being 100% surprises. Nobody gets advance notice, and they explicitly don't make a distinction between lockdown drills and real emergencies when they make the announcement. It's freaky as shit. I strongly disagree with our school district's opinion on the matter. Especially considering the fact that I have (albeit mild) Asperger's syndrome, and any sudden stress can be brutal. "
"293","it's good to have school fire drills, lock down drills, a  evacuation  drills. and don't worries about the alarm noise. at least your safe from the danger."
"294","I have severe anxiety and I would have been crying and having a panic attack"

"298","We once had a lockdown at my high school. The career tech school had a crisis so they as well as the high school & middle school and a local college had lockdowns (all three schools were in the same neighborhood as the 'career center'). A guy apparently was drunk trying to pick up his daughter & fought with the front office & he had some kind of weapon. Then he ran off into the building and while cops were looking for him we all had lockdowns until he was found and arrested. We didn't know all of this until later but in my class teachers were called & they told us to get away from doors/Windows & be quiet it was a lockdown. No one knew what was really going on. For a little while I wondered if I'd get to go home that day. I didn't have my phone & I wanted so bad to text my mom telling her I loved her cause I didn't know if I'd see her again. Thankfully after an hour things were okay & when I got home and saw my parents I was so overjoyed"

"300","It's complete madness that we now live in a world where school teachers are being taught how to disable a gun man. Sad times. America needs to revise its laws on guns. In the UK this type of incident is so rare it almost never happens because guns are not readily available to everyone x"
"301","Those take-down techniques work until it's a real gun and they shooter could easily shoot the person taking them down."
"302","In Texas, we all gather and hide somewhere where the shooter wouldn't see us if he/she opened the door. What kind of idiot makes the students huddle in the corner, right where the shooter could see them?"

"306","its drill time"
"307","here's a thought. if you want to stop a shooter prop desks up on the door. more shit in the way the harder it is to get in."
"308","I actually had a real lockdown once but it was just a false alarm. But if this ever happened why in the fuck would you just sit in the corner of the classroom and lock the door thinking that you would be safe? All they have to do is shoot the lock open and they're in. If this ever happened at my school I would be getting the hell outta there because i'm not just going to sit there and let them kill me. And are the kids really thinking that throwing things at the gunman going to keep them safe? LMFAO"
"309","I cant beleive you guys are over reacting about this, I have experienced these drills and they arent scary. we all keep quiet and wait. it really isnt scary. this prepares us. the more real the drill the more self aware and considerate we become, besides this report reveals the process of protocal"
"310","Yeah cause putting children in a corner makes it all the more harder for a shooter to aim."

"318","""You're asking a lot of people to be heroes. Who don't even have the training"". You don't have to have training to be a hero. Anyone who risks their life in the effort to save another is a hero. Even if they died while doing so. Even if their efforts were useless. The fact that they tried, and the fact that they valued their own love so much less than someone else's makes them a hero."
"319","It's so difficult. How do we protect our kids? I mean, some say give teachers guns. Nope. I had a teacher who broke my arm by throwing a metal chair at me for talking. In FOURTH grade. Parents complained and nothing had been done. Some parents, including my own, decided to send us in with recorders. We were then threatened with a lawsuit by the school. I remember leaning over and asking the kid next to me if I could use his sharpener. After he threw the chair at me, he refused to let me go to the nurse. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and got up. All the commotion moved to the doorway where he was trying to physically restrain me into the classroom and another teacher came out. I  didn't care how much he was screaming at me, my fucking arm was fractured. I was sitting there at my desk before I got up, with my head down just holding my shoulder screaming. Other kids were even crying. I would never want teachers to have guns after that. Opens a door for an all new kind of terror."

"326","All of this nonsense over hoaxes and lies. they want our guns. Wake up"
"327","In my school, during a drill like this we are not sitting on the ground. that is the worst thing you can do. The shooter can just walk in and shoot kids even easier. they should be up and throwing objects to distract."
"328","7:45 countries with no guns be like"
"329","The problem with these drills is that they probably would never work. Most teachers would not have the courage to actually get close to a real gunman, and if they did would probably be shot before making any contact at all. I think they should find a way to lock the doors securely and fastly, get their students in a corner invisible by the door window, and have teachers armed themselves with qualified training. or maybe even a taser."

"339","Wow are our neighbors really doing this in their schools? This is insane, I live in the murder capital of my country and we never hear about this especially in a school. Why expose them to artificial trauma in the chance it will happen, there must be a better way like investing in safe lock doors/ bulletproof glass interiors or methods of non-lethal self protection given to staff?? I have no idea...Craziness!"
"340","giving the shooter a big massive target in a corner of the room is totally the logical thing to do... which down syndrome nigga came up with this. the better thing to do is 1. get a bunch of people next to the door and jump that nigga when he walks in. 2. barricade the door with the fucken 30 desks laying around"

"353","Our school doesn't tell us if it is real or not. And they actually have the emergency alarm and a person walking around pretending to be a shooter. It's actually scary as hell."
"354","Your drills may not be, but ours are since we've had close calls in the past. We aren't told if it's a drill, the teachers dont know. No ones knows if there is a chance people we once saw everyday will be lying dead inside the room next door. They keep us hidden for over thirty minutes, long enough for doubt and worry to settle in. Then, they don't ever announce that there isnt a killer. They go door to door unlocking them and calming all of us. And on the occasion, police officers will be in the halls looking for anyone who was out in the halls or in the bathrooms and they will come to the door and evacuate certain classes just to make it feel more real and test how we would react."

"384","my lock down drills are Boring but I like it cause we just sit around and no learning"
"385","Idiot gun nuts in the comments"
"386","I think preparing for attack is a way better plan then sitting in a fucking corner. Seriously what the fuck is that going to do? You should have someone by the door (someone strong) with some kind of weapon. That way if the shooter walks in hes caught by surprise and then have the whole class to back you up with there weapons. Really REALLY stupid to just sit and hope that he changes his mind and doesn't shoot you. Yea sorry im not gonna await my death."
"387","in my school we just hide in the cubbys there is no act"
"388","i was in choir practicing for a concert for that night we were in the auditorium. when the announcements came on the principal said there is an intruder in the building he said it quietly too  my teacher ran to the doors and locked them and told us to get down we were all actually scared and i seen fear in my teachers eyes too. the announcements came back on and said it was only a drill. we were all just mad and scared. if the teachers were suppose to know about it my teacher looked as if he didn't and we all were almost in tears. i thought that was scary. this is too much. wow"
"389","I had one today .."
"390","If I was the teacher I would be getting all those desk and covering it real good"
"391","is this like a code blue cause I want to be sure OK?!?!!"
"392","How about arming some guards in each school so the kids can have a chance, instead of just cowering and hoping not to die.  It's all about money, they don't want to pay for guards, so the common practice is to just cower down, and hope the bad guy runs out of ammo before he gets to you.  Fuck that.....PAY FOR SOME ARMED GUARDS."
"393","I don't get it when people say ""if there is no guns there will be no shootings""
Guns will always exist whether you like it or not."
"394","Umm. that teacher training shit is really great but the real question is what happens if the shooter kills the teacher first? Then what?"
"395","omg this is terrible they shouldn't scare the life out of kids that's just cruel"
"396","Personally I feel that if you need drills like these then there is something messed up with both your gun laws and education system."
"397","Here's the solution to stop school shootings. Arm all teachers and staff with a gun, and have a big sign out front that says ""All Staff Are Armed And Trained."""
"398","I'd be the kid under the desk to say out loud ""where's a gun when you need one."""
"399","lock down drills hell the shooters have done this in school so yea they know we're the fuck we are"
"400","Why not put locks on every door going forward? If it's a fire hazard then fine, utilize it only when your in immediate danger...but wouldn't that help? Or have like a chain or some sort of mechanism that will keep the door shut!   "
"401","My school hardly do any drills. The last time we did, we all walked slowly to the lobby, lineup and that's it. We don't learn to survive for barricade ourselves, thank God there aren't any shootings where I am."
"402","when we have a drill, the freaking girls get on their phones and start laughing"
"403","basically theyre saying, better get used to school shootings. don't ask any questions unless you want stomped and but stroked. good job America. such, conspiracy theory to think this is manipulation. wake the fuck up you dumbfucks. WHY and WHAT is the point of these ""drills"" what is scaring the kids do? what does taking guns do?"
"404","drills that basically show you *exactly* how they fake this shit. haha sandy hook?? are you serious?"
"405","How bout security guards get a gun?"
"406","We need more armed citizens, More armed teachers or School Staff. Fuck this Gun Control bullshit."
"407","3:50 the girl who just jumped out and exposed herself to the hallway would be dead even if she successful disarmed the shooter if there were another shooter behind him, and 4:15 look at how skinny that girl is, she'll never win a wrestling match against the dude twice her size, and the shooters are probably armed with other weapons such as kinves and pistols as back up, she should be striking the vital organs such as eyes, throat and focus on escaping when she have the chance. the only thing these practice does is give the kids a false confident into playing hero and getting them selves killed, if they r really planning on fighting back, they should gear the kids up with protective equipments and train them in realistic combat where their opponent don't just play along and actually strikes/ shoot back"
"408","What if the teacher is a psycho and starts blasting students."
"409","I do like the idea of self defence though"
"410","I think lockdown drills more than once a year are great, but not fake dead people in the school!!!! God and even the fake shooter. Just have a teacher come and check if they can see the kids or not"
"411","I live in England and I used to get excited over fire drills when I was in school! Thank God I live in England"
"412","White people making schools worry..."
"413","Solution is simple. There should be a hidden gun in each classroom with a code and safe, that can be opened only when there's a shooter alarm."
"414","if someone was shooting up in my school i aint hiding under a desk to get shot, im out that bitch"
"415","If the teachers were armed this shit wouldn't happen"
"416","We had a tornado drill gone wrong before. So are school went into a tornado drill (they do this 2 times a year) but what they did not know that there was actually one at the time and when we were going back to class, the school was hit and no one was killed and only like 4 were injured"
"417","For fuck sake this is the 21st century, why don't we just place bullet proof doors and windows in every single classroom."
"418","Police officers are fucking pussies, they wait for several hours outside schools while students and teachers die then they start to enter fucking classrooms, libraries, etc when everything is finally over."
"419","the real question is ""are you gonna use that tactic if its real or are you gonna coward in fear?"""
"420","More schools need to use ALICE training. It's a billion times more effective than just hiding and making yourself a target"
"421","I shit myself when there is a fire alarm, I don't know what I would do if they do this I the UK..."
"422","They actually enjoy this.

Crazy...Ass...Country"
"423","Crazy Ass Country."
"424","Americans are so full on"
"425","Bruh their giving information to the school shoters"
"426","Why not just break a window and haul ass"
"427","I'm climbing out the window. Fuck that shit"
"428","Who the fuck is gonna be all crowd in a class waiting for a shooter to walk in and get a 30 kill feed and get a tactical nuke and bomb the school? "
"429","Sandy Hook Shooting was a fake, gtfo."
"430","We protect our president with guns, we protect our government buildings with guns, we protect our celebrities with guns, gun owners protect their families with guns, we protect our schools with a sign that reads "" GUN FREE ZONE"". That's why we have school shootings"
"431","0:41    really......... really"
"432","lol in a near future school shotings will be part of american cultures"
"433","hard to watch..."
"434","All teachers should have a 50 cal end of story"
"435","Sandy hook looked faker than this.  WHOOO EEEE"
"436","What do you guys think we should to prevent School shooting? I want the public's honest opinion. (Edit: I know we can't have a 100% success rate but we can help decrease its incline.)"
"437","Im Soo scared of lockdowns lat week the lights went off and the fire drill went on every where i live the lights went off and some how the fire drill went on because of that"
"438","Hmm if it were money we would guard it with armed guards but not our biggest investment. Our children. Smh"
"439","For her sake I hope the gunman doesn't have two guns lol"
"440","haha america"
"441","teacher: oh no lockdown better clump in a corner to be safe!
shooter: COLLATERAL"
"442","Sadly, these type of drills can't really save people from these madmen. The teachers should be armed, as well as trained to fight. That's the only way. Not to hide and hope the ""Boogeyman"" goes away. Or try to jump the gunman as soon as he gets in the door."
"443","these hoes dead"
"444","crazy america.....wow"
"445","holy fucking shit. if sandyhook did indeed happen, why the fuck is that child in a fucking Styrofoam fucking coffin. fuckin bullllshit.  fuck abc, fuck fox, and fuck cnn."
"446","Yeah teach the kids to group up in a corner. Real smart except for the fact that the shooter would most likely have explosives meaning if he throws and explosive into the corner half the kids will be dead. Good job america."
"447","Wow, in Canada, class behaviour is actually worse during a lockdown drill. C'mon, two people were watching Doctor Who under a desk."
"448","My school does this a lot"
"449","What a stupid country America is.. doing drills for school shootings instead of changing gun laws and fact that anyone can buy a gun and civilians are allowed to buy uzis, semi automatic machine guns. (Which are pun intended Over-kill for self-defence)

Children should not be living in fear. But while culture of America is based around fear paranoia and perpetual wars and violence."
"450","What a stupid county America is.. doing drills for school shootings instead of changing gun laws and fact that anyone can buy a gun and civilians are allowed to buy uzis, semi automatic machine guns and ak47s. (Which are pun intended Over-kill for self-defence)"
"451","Look at these ""heroes"" taking time out of their school day to rehearse their own deaths... Murca moves in mysterious ways."
"452","no one in the bay area would actually shoot up a school cause most of the kids have guns on them so theyll be fuck"
"453","Give some guns to the teachers and be done with it..."
"454","ABC News is so full of shit. Come on down to any public school in the ghettos in Los Angeles if you want to see a real lock down."
"455","i think kids should get this training so they know what to do in a situation like that"
"456","Everyone come to school to learn. But when you know what there's a gunman this isn't right.I DONT get how after 18 you get guns like that's just stupid why would u be able to get a gun when policeman protect you because ALOT OF people use it for bad reasons.Imagine your child texting you, ""hey mom there's a shooter I'm scared"".
•1 how would you feel?
•2 what if it was your child if not niece 
•3 think about it and leave it in the response bellow and what would u say."
"457","I go to th awesome school they have closets and we hide in there I'm in elementary school first grade :D"
"458","wow... desensitizing kids instead of hiring security and imposing strict firearms regulations..."
"459","Or you could just ban guns..."
"460","If that was me I would be out the window."
"461","I saw police with guns in SandyHook Elementary School because students scared locked the doors and windows down kill and dead"
"462","this is absolute madness..."
"463","I go to Arapahoe and my lock down drills are upwards of 2 hours, I was t their for the shooting, but ever since the shooting the school feels different, but a safe different, we have 6 campus patrol officers, 2 in the school, and a fire station AND police station right down the street, I was at Powell middle school when the shooting happened and we had to stay at school until 730 at night, and we still had fricken school on Monday, but bottom line this school handles it wrong"
"464","gun control."
"465","So much for gun laws in the U.S.A. they have to resort to doing this."
"466","Out of 160 shooting 99.9% is fake hoaxes.  This video is disgusting.  Who's selling fear porn?  "
"467","All my school does is turn off the lights and hide behind a desk. Anyone could shoot the door open."
"468","If a shooter actually came through the door, they would fight back way harder than they showed here,  most likely reloading right before coming in the next door, and they aren't going to tell the practice shooter to punch the people in the face so they aren't truly prepared."
"469","My school has that!"
"470","Well there are parents and students constantly coming and going from probables to the building and parents coming for early dismissal, though they should lock every door but the main entrance."
"471","+Nate Bravender lol the average high school in the USA starts at 7:45-8:00"
"472","+Kevin Aero At my school our security guards have guns."
"473","+Space underground Security guards are trained tho."
"474","Shooters will take down the guards first and get more ammos"
"475","My school security guard has one."
"476","+Space underground Put it on the school supply list at the beginning of the year.  SOME parent is bound to send their kid to school with a Glock and a bag full of ammo.  COME ON, this is America.  I could find a Glock faster than I could find those little glue stick thingies.  Tell me that you couldn't.  Honestly."
"477","Government don't want to spend money buying guns for every school in every classroom."
"478","Going for the M.O.A.B"
"479","lmaooo"
"480","Care packages incoming where do you want it?"
"481","+mavishill Guns are like drugs. Even if they're illegal, people will get their hands on them."
"482","""What a stupid country America is"" doesn't complete ellipsis and is using site made by Americans"
"483","Omg life's so hard isn't it"
"484","+EpicMILFTime Guns already aren't allowed in schools.  It doesn't get stricter than that.  By the way, we have a right to own guns in the US so it's not like that's going away unless 3/4 state legislatures ratify an amendment to our Constitution."
"485","but my school already had both of those."
"486","Well if they had a) a fucking cop squad with metal detectors on your school. b) better fire arm regulations so that fucking asshole couldn't get the gun in first place, c) if they just implement the fucking chip already.
d) if they made fire arms illegal... sure criminals would probably get a hold of guns either way but it would be SO much more difficult for these idiot kids who just go and grab daddy's gun and
 then shoot people at school, that's what serious, strict regulations mean, and to begin with only people 30 and up should be allowed to acquire guns, people with kids should be legally forced to make sure those guns are safely locked away (and this should be inspected).
Personally I think they should just implement the fucking chip already."
"487","The thought of kids just sitting there waiting to be shot scares me. I'd rather each class room have an emergency open window. The kids would have more a chance running. 
And what about the poor lonely kids stuck hiding on the toilet?  All alone.  Just not right. 
Run and or fight back."
"488","if somebody going to knife me I GO THEACHER YADERE XD like that u can't kill theachers and 911 yea"
"489","Loool American schools need armed guards on campus and metal detectors, haha glad I don't live in that shit hole. Great I think your gun laws are defiantly helping you. Haha"
"490","At Least do a fallout drill"
"491","This is why my school reinforces the doors so that they cant be opened easily when locked. Grate glass (ya know the kind) are also used. Plus my dean has a .357 in a glass case on a shelf and the rounds in a safe. Big guy, very imposing. Plus if something happened you know there would be the really tough maintenance guys coming at him with steel tire irons and nail guns."
"492","I had a drill out of no wear where my gym teacher was holding a bat and saying if you come any closer I will knock you across the head with it is this bad we where all really scared almost crying we thought it was real that's what they made us think"
"493","FEAR MEDIA!!!"
"494","Your kids should not have phones in school!"
"495","give those teachers some jiu jitsu lessons"
"496","How do you know what hand the man is holding the gun in?"
"497","These drills are all bullshit. There only trying to put fear in everyone to think that guns are bad so they can start the war on guns and confiscation. They use patsies if needed."
"498","km sad"
"499","The scenario in the video kinda happened at my school today. We had NO clue it was a drill. We ALL were texting our parents that there was a lockdown. It was the BEST drill that ACTUALLY prepared us for what might actually happen."
"500","Why not just take the shooter down to the ground, they are not immortal"
"501","at Bronaugh R7 school the class will atack"
"502","my school does not do that but it looks fun as a Drill"
"503","a kid brought a bomb to my school once but he wired it wrong so it didn't go off. if it did it would blow up half the school. thankfully it didnt"
"504","she has that let me talk to the manager hair"
"505","The thing is that my school doesn't have curtains for doors"
"506","If America just fucking banned guns this wouldn't happen. Why is America just the worst, most stupid place in the word. Sort it out asswipes"
"507","in my school we hid in the bathroom"
"508","My teacher says if 50 of you guys throw chairs and random stuff at the guy then we should be ok😂"
"509","i was in one for 5 hours it was so scary now in in vithhurl school"
"510","The last scene with the tennis balls and tackling the gunman could actually work i think. But the best option would be if all the teacher had concealed carry."
"511","what's columbine?"
"512","Shooting drills? Only in America because anywhere else doesn't have such frequent school shootings."
"513","fight back"
"514","Not warning the kids. Fuck them. Someone could have gotten hurt, really easily. They should have warned everyone. Assholes. Rot in hell. I would transfer to a different school if they did that at my school"
"515","This is really fucked up in so many ways."
"516","I feel bad for laughing, but I totally died when they threw the tennis balls at the shooter"
"517","In a real lock down i would break a window and leave and run to my local store. I wouldnt stay and die. These procidures where made by liberals and democrats who WANT kids to die so they can force gun control"
"518","Wow, it makes me feel fortunate not to live in a country where you have to worry someone could come into your school and shoot you."
"519","the government should make the guns and bullets  ridiculously expense like 50 thousand dollars and get gunmakers to keep their job by making the guns only for the government army and police departments. Actually, I don't think we need to make guns and ammo expense when those weapons are for the military and police"
"520","Terrible idea. Now kids won't want to come to school. That doesn't help anyone.
And if you're going to have this drill teach the bigger, stronger kids to ambush the shooter at the door. Don't lie down for target practice.
Better yet, put a plain clothed officer in every school. That's the best way to stop a shooter. We have the resources as a nation to do this. But we don't care enough about the kids to make it happen."
"521","I wish our school had awesome drills like these ^_^"
"522","One time, 2 years ago, there was a robbery at TD Bank a few miles away from us. The criminal had firearms and every school in the district went into lock down. The lock down lasted about 2 to 3 hours PASS our school time. Then, we had the police swarm around our school. Luckily, the criminal was arrested! It was truly terrifying because my mother was with me for ""Take Your Child to Work Day"". That was a day that I will never forget."
"523","I go to school in the same district as Columbine, and let me tell you, hiding under a desk gets old..."
"524","I go to school in the same district as Columbine, and let me tell you, hiding under a desk gets old..."
"525","how times have changed. when i was in elementary school, we had fire drills and earthquake drills; never shooting drills."
"526","Saving lives, how I hate that."
"527","This makes me angry."
"528","I feel like this is a must do for all schools not exactly sitting in one area all to gather but at least teaching the teachers self defense and disarming like this"
"529","Bruh, my school does nothing like this. They just announce that there's a drill and we huddle in a corner and talk like nothing is happening. The principal then walks around the school and shakes the door a little bit."
"530","We are told to stay in one corner and I never know why. Staying in one corner could kill everyone. And everyday I think what if somebody comes and shoots everyone what if I live but my friends day. Why do they let anyone have a gun. Why is America like this. I'm 13. I shouldn't have to worry about this. Nobody should have to worry about this shooting. And what happens if my little brother dies or anyone I know dies. What if someone breaks in. Yes, we put heavy desk and laptops and books around but. What if is the worst sentence ever."
"531","okay im in school but why not say to the person who is going to kill you ""why are you doing this why:"
"532","5 minutes at most? In Canada we have lockdown drills that are unannounced and last approximately 45 minutes.
I really like the idea of training the teachers, though."
"533","I want the job of the guy that gets to do a school shooting without consequences.."
"534","Really I'm just saying they have a fucking gun and I know what to do during a shooting don't be a hero and pretend ur dead unless they are shooting the body's then when,u get the change run and try to save people not to be a hero to help ur fellow classmates and friends"
"535","It's all fun and games until little Jimmy reveals his hidden m16 and joins with the terrorist(s). Maybe you shouldn't have made fun of his speech impediment. Maybe sharing that kitkat bar would've saved your life. Now, the last thing you'll hear is the sound of him studdering, struggling to say the words - ""Wow what a great audience"""
"536","I always tell my brother to teach me how to fight if the drill was not real he said i dont care :/ but he teahed me something"
"537","what if it's a RPG?"
"538","1:25 omg thats my friends mom!"
"539","Yeah, sit in the corner in a big group.

That will definitely not make is easier for him to mow down the entire class."
"540","Dear God, I have two nieces, and they're starting Kindergarten this coming Wednesday, I'm a little nervous that something Like This happened at their school, because if it happened in Columbine, Virginia Tech, Conn, Penn, etc. etc. it could happen everywhere."
"541","I think Teachers should have handguns or at least Taser Guns to protect their Class, BUT a gun License would be needed!"
"542","Heroes don't have training.  It's better to fight for your life than to sit and die....  I think that is the message we need to get across.  Shooters are cowards...they have no more power than one person deciding to say ""not me...not today""."
"543","In florida you don't need license plates on cars?"
"544","Only in 'murica"
"545","Oh yeah, just hide behind a desk, talk about shooting fish in a barrel... I'd just point the kids towards the front door and say ""run and don't look back"""
"546","Wow the colombine teacher is sexy!(; lol"
"547","No point in teaching disarming skills when they hardly work in real life."
"548","They wouldn't have to do these drills if they just got decent gun laws!!!"
"549","I asked my teacher what we would do if a shooter came in (someone had said online that they would come shoot up a school in that area, not one specific school but we still had the school full of policemen) and she said she'd protect us with her life"
"550","that holly teacher is hot"
"551","6:11 HOLY SHIT"
"552","When my school does lockdown drills the teacher would jump the douche and the kids would break a window and escape through it while the teacher holds down the douche until cops come."
"553","If the teachers pull down the blind on the door, then the shooter is going to know which rooms are occupied... I don't see what difference it'd make. "
"554","Oh yeah, sit in a corner and hope not to die. "
"555","Fuck that if this shit happened to me I would not stated that damn corner I would break the fucking window in the fuck out then dip down the street hell no I'm getting out tf outta there!😂"
"556","In my brothers school their was bomb threat ,it's scary thinking about that stuff."
"557","God these drills are scary. But effective. They teach us to get into any cupboards and lockers we can fit in. And if we're out in the hall, to either run into a classroom or run outside and hide. Most drills are fun, some are just plain terrifying. We never actually had a shooter though."
"558","When i was in 6th grade i had just recently moved to a new school and i became friends with this weird kid. Everyone bullied him and was very mean to him and i was his only friend at the school until one day when in the lunch line he told me he would bring a gun to school and kill the people who bullied him, and if i told anyone he would kill me too. I stopped talking to him after that."
"559","Next year in 7th grade I hope to get a certain teacher because he has a metal bat behind his desk"
"560","Ahhhhhh........America "
"561","We just hide in a corner. Then lock the door. Once we put a note out that we were at the library 😅 they just rattle the door"
"562","During our drills the teacher would pin the shooter and then....... RELEASE THE BEASTS"
"563","I don't know if this is just me but if I'm in a classroom and I see a window in it and hear shots in the hallway then that motherfucker is getting broken and I'm leaving because what is a little piece of paper pulled over the glass in a door against a fucking gun? Nothing....."
"564",""
"565","The fact that there has to be shooting drills makes me sad"
"566","my school does shooting drills without the guns"
"567","I don't understand people who says 'in my country this doesn't happen because we have strict gun control'; well in my country we also have it, and it's total CAOS, only the bad guys have guns and the population is totally helpless, and we also have one of the highest killing percentages caused by guns...
"
"568","This is the dumbest shit I've seen in my life responsibly armed teachers is the answer."
"569","In my school, they put a football player in every classroom so if the shooter were to come in, they would truck the shooter hard "
"570","Here's a question, if you're that worried about somebody hurting the kids, why not arm the teachers and tell them to shoot and kill them before there is another columbine shooting?"
"571","Barricade the fuckin door, I always said that's what me and football buddies would do"
"572","We have lockdown drills twice a year. I think that these drills are awesome because last year we actually had two students threaten to shot up our school. Had they done this we would have had to do a lockdown but without practice we would have not known what to do. Thank god nothing happened but if it did how would we know what to do without practicing a lockdown? At my school we also do fire drills, emergency evacuation drills, shelter in place drills, secure the building drills(similar to a lockdown but the difference is the door is just secured and regular education continues. We do these when a student gets out in the bathroom or in the hallway and we need ems to take them to the hospital or if the police where searching for a suspect nearby we go into a secure the building) and tornado and earthquake drills"
"573","This looks fun.. "
"574","We do the same thing at my school. Except there are no police with guns. We even have one teacher that waits by the door with a metal baseball bat."
"575","My school tells us to go under our desks but my science teachers do anything to hide"
"576","when we have a shut down i guy have a gun its not a pistol it was do you now the swats guns i grab that and my teacher say grab it i did and i shoot him in the head and the police good job they say i will pay you i say ok and the police man say here your mony i say thx"
"577","That's sad 
"
"578","i also get made fun of for liking and caring for dogs. Really now? i thought people have hearts for dogs? i guess the people at my school dont. thats why we need more shootings in schools to wipe out the idiots."
"579","im so fed up of my classmates making fun of me for liking disney and looney tunes. What the fuck man?
   i cant like whatever i want to like anymore because of too many judgemental people in society. 
  now i have a bad reputation in school just because of my personality."
"580","we need more and more shootings at school"
"581","I remember the time at my school this happened and we didn't know it wash a drill. And I was in the same class as my sister and brother. As soon as the officer came in I rushed him XD and he calmly pulled me off and told us it was a drill.. I'll do anything to protect my siblings XD"
"582","Once At My School We Had An Shooting And I Saw The Shooter And Attacked Him And He Walked Out Without Hurting Anyone And He Came Out With Scatches XD I Didnt Study 3 Years Of Self Defense For Nothing (And I Had A Pocket Knife Lol)"
"583","My father was in the Colorado shooting since then my dad is scared passing by school. SERECLY DAD? OK .... Awkard"
"584","HHAAAHAHAH STUPID FUCKING AMERICANS, THIS THINGS HAPPEN ONLY IN USA BECAUSE USA KILLS PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES  SO THIS IS A PAYBACK, I HOPE U ALL KILL EACH OTHER ! ! !"
"585","Kids shouldn't need to be taught how to react and behave when a school shooter comes in. Why? There shouldn't be any school shooters, American citizens shouldn't be given the freedom to buy and own a firearm. And if anybody asks my logic behind this, guns are banned in the UK. Look how few shootings we have."
"586","When I have lockdowns (4th grade. technically now in 5th) I get really scared thinking will I die? And I feel unsafe, when the principal shakes the door, I curl up, my heart- at a racing pace.."
"587","You look at the fucking gun he's holding in your fucking face."
"588","No guns at my school though."
"589","The school you shot up."
"590","+Dylan Klebold That's ironic. Dylan klebold one of the shooters XD"
"591","they never actually wanted to go wyd???"
"592","+Matt Williams Some schools can't afford extra security though. I know the high school I went to, could barely even afford new text books, let alone repair the roof that leaked every year, or replace the heating system that only kept half the building at a semi reasonable temperature."
"593","You act as if kids show up to school anyway..."
"594","Which is very sad that they don't take it seriously. that's why you have to educate yourself so if something like this did happen at least you would know what to do."
"595","Same any kind of drills in my school are never taken seriously"
"596","Well if your like his best friend or something "
"597","I know but what if? He doesn't"
"598","If you say that to them they will shoot you on the spot never trust gunman"
"599","You know that kids at Colombine actually pretended to be dead and it worked and didn't die"
"600","+PooTato Dylan Klebiod and Eric Harris"
"601","Lol maybe the jocks wouldn't have died if you haven't made fun of (Colombine kids I can't remember there names) and maybe JUST maybe you could have been friends but nooooo you had to be a jerk."
"602","Then everyone's fucked."
"603","yeah I mean let's ban guns when they go to shoot up a school they would be like ""oh darn guns are illigal dang can't shoot up this school"""
"604","+becka if guns are made illegal then the only people who will have guns are criminals who buy them on the black market. Then the criminals will have guns and the law abiding citizens would have no way to protect themselves"
"605","+BeckaBN ""But you wouldn't need them for safety if nobody had guns""        That's the dumbest thing iv'e ever fucking heard.    YOU need a gun.   Guess what sweetheart if a 250lb man grabs you and you don't have a gun your going to wake up with a sore ass...     If he doesn't cut your fucking throat open.          I don't know how you've survived so long being so naive but i truly hope you continue to be lucky."
"606","+BeckaBN ignorance is bliss"
"607","But of course we don't really break a window in practices. We just pretend to."
"608","+Uncle Ben In the drill they were probably told by the fake killer to go there."
"609","Lol that would be pretty fun I would be laughing"
"610","+Uncle Ben That's literally what you do. My principal it so stupid he told us to ""Throw paper balls at the shooter if they access the room"""
"611","+Uncle Ben Those kids just have to hope the shooter is a storm trooper"
"612","+Uncle Ben I know, it's not the safest or effective way, but, timing is the main priority here. It's not like the intruder(s) will give you time to escape. :/"
"613","+aSStronaut111 You should always report threats like that, especially if it involves death among you and other peers. Even if it's a friend of yours! He's not a friend if he threatens to kill you either.."
"614","Did he do it I mean not kill you but bring a gun to school"
"615","it's always a good thing to know how to protect yourself"
"616","fuck off, i cant deal with stupid people no more"
"617","+Robert Sandifer where do I look stupid. "
"618","HAHAHAAHHA CANT ENGLISH, MAN U R SO STUPID THAT U DONT KNOW HOW STUPID U LOOK!!!! I IZNAPUSIS MI SE S KURAC!!"
"619","+Robert Sandifer your the stupid one who can't English XD
Kannst du lesen? 😛"
"620","yes i know u r 2 stupid 2 understand, i feel sorry 4 u"
"621","+xMattyCat YT who cares"
"622","So? Are you me? Are you? 

You're a retard for not knowing you aren't me"
"623","+Inspiree Jamaa You cant have a youtube accout unless you're 13+ retard."
"624","Today I had a real fire drill at the end of the day when buses were being dismissed. My pencil is still in my bus room. "
"625","Well apparently the only school that is f*cked up is my school. Every single drill or emergency that happens, the students never take it seriously. They always laugh and make noises ON PURPOSE. They think they're funny, but they aren't. When the situation is over, the teacher yells at the whole class because of those f*cked up students. And those students will literally get my a** killed or something."
"626","and they only last for like tops 20 mins - half and hour (the drills)"
"627","I live in Australia andwe have a spesific bell just for lockdown drills and when we hear it we just have to lock the door, shut and lock the windows, get under the desks and stay quiet and then once we hear the same bell we heard alerting us that there was a lockdown that means the threat is gone."
"628","Here's an idea: Maybe keep all doors and windows locked shut?
Seriously. that's what we did in my former high school, and someone would always get up to get the door to let a student or faculty member in."
"629","""I feel safer in 'gun-free' zones because the criminals aren't aloud to use guns in them. That's how it works right?"""
"630","After the tragic Newton shooting my school got better safety equipment giving every door (into a new block of the building) a pin. The students new this pin as did the teachers, and the doors would open for 10minuets during class change over, and then lock. I live in England where things like this hardly ever happen, yet my school still worry. Honestly, guns are horrible things, and give anyone power over life "
"631","My little brother I said he sat for 2 hours for some house robber near him spotted with a gun"
"632","Damn!! I live in New Zealand, we had fire and earthquake drills, but we never ever had a lockdown drill. I don't ever remember them talking about that either. We don't have many bad things happen like that here but gosh we would have been screwed if someone did come to shoot! The school would have gone nuts! "
"633","Maybe the parents and teachers should keep a closer eye on problematic kids and give them the help that they need. Don't make depression worse with isolation and singling them out as bad people. When you make them feel like they're part of the community and wanted in the community, they most likely won't have any tendencies to destroy the community."
"634","Better to go down fighting if they come in the room, then cowering in a corner"
"635","Yeah the best thing is to take gang up on the shooter,  with anything when he enters the door.  The door is your last line of defence and he knows that,  when he enters the door knock him out and hold him down"
"636","Now you know when you have a good teacher, she says, Its the thought of anyone wanting to even hurt ""My"" kids....."
"637","Ive gone to alot of schools who never tell you if its a drill or not.And since we live in colorado (Home of the Columbine Massacre) they remind us of the tragedy and scare the living crap out of us"
"638","o  god  good   job"
"639","There was a man who many kids saw including me in the woods beside our elm school in 1st grade and we stayed locked down for 4 hours when the police found him there was guns fired and I was so scared I told my crush I liked him and played on my phone  "
"640","Well that is crazy! Sometimes we have unannounced drills. They announce them we lock the door, cover the windows, turn off the lights and hide in the corner. We NEVER do what they did."
"641","In my school, if we need to break a window to escape the school, were aloud to. Along with rushing the guy."
"642","My school taught us in seperate classes to run outside and in a zig-zag motion in a shooting situation drill. #cantgetusbitch"
"643","If you're American, do you really think gun control is ridiculous, but this is not?"
"644","I think the United States is one of the greatest democracies ever, but if you have to prepare your kids for shootings, there is something really wrong. I'm not talking about the drills. I'm talking about raising damaged kids, allowing them to get access to somekind of weapon. What's wrong with you american citizens? How could this happen so often? You should definetly wake up after all of this."
"645","I don't see how sitting in a fucking corner helps keep anybody alive if some one was to come in the room."
"646","All the teachers do is huddle them up in a corner that's the worst hiding place I've ever seen all the shooter has to do is open the door and shoot the kids do you want them to be killed!? If I was there I would break open the window run home it makes perfect since I mean why would just sit there in class waiting for the shooter to come in"
"647","Awesome prank though."
"648","130 yeah right no road in Fl. can let you get those speeds and almost got a ticket? If a cop caught him at those speeds he WOULD get a ticket. There is no ""Almost"" standard cars can't go 130"
"649","The only reason why psychos like targeting school is because libtards think laws will prevent them from shooting up the place. Organizations like NRA want to arm teachers in school so they ACTUALLY have the ability to defend themselves! The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
"650","What has more brains than the students at sandy hook? 

>The wall behind them "
"651","average 1 a month? wtf? that's not true is it?"
"652","who elsethink teachers shoud be allowed to carry guns"
"653","yeah lets just hide the kids under the tables and wait for the shooter to blow their brains all over the carpet, why font they open the windows and evacuate like that and run as fast as you can and don't look back?"
"654","If they did a drill in my school where they fired blanks I would be like fuck this shit take a school chair and smash the window open and get the fuck out"
"655","And how exactly is huddling in a corner a defense? Doesn't that just make it easier for a gunman to take everyone out quickly? This is a terrible idea, some kid's gun-toting Dad is going to swing by the school during one of these, think it's real, and blow the guy away."
"656","I would have been he one shot in the ass....."
"657","they should hold mandatory seminars in schools for self defense in this situation. Power In Numbers"
"658","So so tragic... a good documentary to help us understand this is ( We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook )...God bless"
"659","I live in the UK and that looks proper scary but I love America I really wanted to visit it in America all their stuff is bigger and better than United Kingdom the foods nicer the stuffs nicer and plus they have really cool places to visit, and most of my fave music and TV shows ect all come from America. 👋🏻🇺🇸"
"660","ok im 15 years old and i think is stupid to sit in a corner while a guy with a gun is in you school try and fight back dont sit in a corner were he just fires and hits 5 people this pisses me off because guess what im one of those kid in that corner and i dont want to die so please change what we do in a lock down drill"
"661","We did drills like these in my high school but everyone just took it as an opportunity to nap cause it took like a half hour for the police to do their walk through"
"662","Is it bad that my school doesn't do fake guns? Just try to get in the doors"
"663","It must suck to live in America... At lease I don't live there XD"
"664","If we had unannounced lock down drills like this, I wouldn't know what to think. Sadly, we don't even have lock down trills anymore and we don't practice the A.L.I.C.E. procedures."
"665","3:00 No. Crazy twat im not"
"666","Good oppertunity to hop the fence and ditch "
"667","This will desensitize these children. When it comes down to a real shooting they won't take any notice as the threat hasn't been real for the last hundred drills, and why would it be now? They wouldn't take it seriously."
"668","I honestly *want* to have another lockdown drill at my high school. We've had like one all year, and it's May, almost June. In my opinion, middle and high schools should have them like every two months of the school year."
"669","In elementary school we had a lockdown I was in the speech room practicing on the word L (It's much better now) with about 5 or so people (the rest of the grade was outside) and they called a lockdown. So they used my jacket and a couple chairs as a wedge as the door. THEN the rest of the grade broke the door down trying to get in. Some people had to stand up in the speech room because it was so small. Then we heard gunshots. But no one was injured. We had another one the same year when we were in the cafe. And we sat there underneath the seats for hours. "
"670","The guy the woman from columbine took on had a popped blood vessel in his eye after she took him down. I'd say that's pretty damn effective if you're causing them to struggle enough to pop a blood vessel."
"671","Im not scared why hide in a room just id go home and hide there"
"672","this is the most retarded shit ive ever seen"
"673","How could u live in a country where school shooting are the norm !!!!!!!!!!! "
"674","Our school tells us to rush the attacker if they come into the room, because if we're a huddled up when he comes in, ya know, it's not good"
"675","Really you used sandyhook for an example are you kidding me that shit was so fake"
"676","We where all in our regular drill set ups. The principle goes around the school and yells and makes noises and kicks doors. Well one time he comes over and just opens the doors and looks at the teacher surprised. The teacher says, "" well um I forgot to lock the door."" Thank God for our teachers am I right."
"677","Dog Pile"
"678","Omg so scary 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
"679","The drill they use will get them killed either way, what we do is barricade the door with tables and chairs, and make weapons out of books and stuff, our drills are fun. ☺️"
"680","In High School we do ALICE, where you just simply run away and get out of the building as fast as possible."
"681","Punk ass school board making pussies"
"682","Australia has like no shootings. Or stabbing a really..."
"683","IS AMERICA'S GOVERNMENT INSANE FUCKING GET PROPER GUN LAWS WE WOULD NEVER EVEN COMPREHEND DOING THIS SORT OF STUFF IN AUSTRALIA BECAUSE WE NEVER!!!! HAVE!!!! SCHOOL!!!! SHOOTINGS!!!!!! BECAUSE OF OUR GUN LAWS!!!!!!!!!!!"
"684","GET IN THERE GIRL"

"687","Mommy...Dylan brought a gun to school,
He told his friends that it was cool,

And when he pulled the trigger back,
It shot with a great, huge crack.

Mommy, I was a good girl.
I did what I was told,

I went to school, I got straight A's, I even got the gold!

When I went to school that day,
I never said good-bye.

I'm sorry that I had to go
But Mommy, please don't cry.

When Dylan shot the gun,
He hit me and another

And all because Dylan,
Got the gun from his brother.

Mommy, please tell Daddy:
That I love him very much

And, please tell my boyfriend:
That it wasn't just a crush

And, tell my little sister:
That she is the only one now

And, tell my dear sweet grandmother:
I'll be waiting for her now

And, tell my wonderful friends:
That they always were the best

Mommy, I'm not the first.
I'm no better than the rest.

Mommy, tell my teachers:
I won't show up for class,

And never to forget this, And please don't let this pass

Mommy, why'd it have to be me?
No"
"688","My school did drills and no one took it seriously because we all knew that the school's security was pretty tight."
"689","last time is happen to me I almost die"
"690","0:17 I would be scared"
"691","160 shooting you have got to be kidding me get your shit together."
"692","This is the sadest thing I have ever seen... Just regulate guns"
"693","Is it just weird i want this kind of drill? Am i the only one? Oh..ok."
"694","The ""teacher training"" seems like they go easy bc if it was real the person shooting would not hold back at all"
"695","I would think that if someone came into our classroom is to jump on the intruder. I think 20 some odd kids can pull down a man!! Surprise attacks or throwing items work too"
"696","Why the fuck would you get into a corner or they can just kill you."
"697","Honestly if a teacher tackled the school shooter I would probably start kicking the shit out of him I ain't fucking dying I'm  helping my teacher (hope to god I never have to)"
"698","when we have school shootings i will be so scared"
"699","One time a drill went of in the bathroom, so me and my classmates hid in the cubbies for at least 30 minutes. My one girl friend was crying and I was so fucking nervous. I went to Lincoln school in Rhode Island and it was close enough to Connecticut that we're scared. "
"700","if someone came into a room in my school with a gun with intent to kill im not gonna sit in the corner of a room. if i might die im gonna fight for my life ."
"701","Yo wtf my school has the shitting drills they just say it's a drill and see if the doors are closed "
"702","if docters invented healing factors school shootings would be a problem am I right people"
"703","if this happened at my school I would just attack/ try to kill the shooter I wouldn't give a shit"
"704","Great job im so proud "
"705","They should of told the parents but still this helps students. I'd rather know this and be repaired (God forbid it does happen) rather then need to know it and not know what to do."
"706","So different, our treachers stand by the door with a big bat, and kids grab scissors and heavy things,and when the door opens you take out he guy coming in."
"707","How is duck and cover going to save you from bullets?"
"708","Vampiro Yoshi -your right but gun crime has gone up 45% since the total ban of guns in the uk.sooooo yaaaaaaaaaa how did that solve the problem for ya.criminals are the only armed people in the street.hmm i wounder why."
"709","one day i was at lunch in school and there was a lockdown"
"710","PRACTICE WHAT, SITTING LIKE FUCKING DUCKS?"
"711","Canada has had 16 school shootings between 1884 and 2014...America has had over 70 between 2010 and 2015, its called gun control people, you should think about using it."
"712","The teacher wouldn't need to struggle that much as I'm sure as soon as the teacher jumped him a couple of students would've started kicking the shit out of him "
"713","in all honesty do you thin that kids while listen in a real shooting."
"714","Drills in which you sit in a corner and hope not to die are stupid. If the shooter comes in they probably know who they want to kill and go to the class and shoot, they don't care about you ducking...."
"715","Another reason why i don't want to move to Ameica including crimes,obesity and racism."
"716","My teacher said if we ever have an actual school shooting we out this bitch, we climbing out of windows and getting help. LMAO YAASS love her."
"717","I mean like, this whole experience drill thing is good. Especially kids texting their parents what's happening. You parents shouldn't even get mad! It's a matter of saving your child's life! It's good practice! But listen, if there was a school shooting at my school and I tried texting my mom for help, damn well her ass would take 50 yrs to call/txt back.. all she do is work, work, work! Can't do shit for her kids! But if it was my dad, he'd be there in a second! He don't play! WE ALL NEED TO KNOW WHO REALLY CARES AND LOVES YOU!"
"718","okay cool and when a kid get s heart attack like some kids do, what you gonna tell there parents? april fools??"
"719","Smoke some weed and chill out.
lol Sandy Hook, fake ass shit"
"720","I remember when i was in Dallas elementary school we had a drill like this. The only difference was that it wasn't a drill and a unknown man entered the building. My class thought it was fake and we started playing around and throwing paper (teacher was a foreigner and not strict). We were laughing and screaming until our English teacher banged on the wall from the other side of the room, and told us to ""shut the fuck up"". Luckily the guy was one of the student's parent that got lost, but they punished our class by giving us crazy amount of homework."
"721","When I see these ""School shooting Drill"", I wonder why they didn't think of them back before 1993, When a student walk into a English Room and open fire on a teacher and then Shoot a Janitor, that was my cousin, that I had to see die in front of me. I was told to run, but couldn't move like I was frozen in place and couldn't see nothing, but my cousin laying on the floor. The teacher said again, in a loud voice run Angie, run and get out of here, I have to live with this memory for the rest of my life. and it not easy as adult, to re-live that day Jan, 18, 1993. But I do every night in my dreams and every places, that has large groups of people."
"722","Hahahah so fucked that is even neccasary in America"
"723","A Teacher can stop a school shooter by being armed, so that Teacher can have a fighting chance when someone threatens their students! "
"724","""Okay kids, there is an armed person in the school who wants to murder as many people as possible because society is fucked and this person is angry as hell. Knowing that this is a gun-free zone and that society has worked tirelessly to make you all fearful of guns, this person has chosen a school to carry out their slaughter. Now, we want you all to sit perfectly still and in large, huddled groups so that when the shooter bursts through the door they don't have to waste time aiming. Be perfectly still, good little sheep."" Fucking idiots."
"725","+ok yeh its different in some places. it just depends on the architecture is, my school had most of it's classrooms in the center of the building."
"726","+Seb Sebster Oh...my former high school had windows"
"727","+ok leave through where? Most classrooms where I live don't have windows. And those windows are not exactly easy to break"
"728","+Seb Sebster Sure it would help. It might not completely block them from coming in, but it would stall them for a bit and give the students a bit more time to take cover or leave through a window. Much better than just having someone quickly open the door and start shooting right?"
"729","Thats not what we are saying at all. "
"730","+Jorge Padua
Yeah... Fuck laws. Just have guns. MORE GUNS FOR EVERYONE. "
"731","+Fury Fresh Yeah, sure, why even have laws if criminals are just going to break them?"
"732","What??? i never seen this"
"733","+Jorge Padua You have absolutely no proof that a firearm purchased from the black market costs more than a car."
"734","+xstylinsooohx #ArapahoeHighSchoolShooting in CO"
"735","It's to make the room look empty so the shooter thinks no one is inside. Breaking a window well depends what floor you're on. Even if you in the first floor there can be a shooter waiting outside too."
"736","Through the years students in my classes have asked what would we do if this were to happen, and ALL of the teachers said something between the lines of  ""I would find a way out of this classroom, we break a window"""
"737","+TheAmazingChristianBigot
Just like how a locked door is an incentive for a shooter to blast a cruise missile at the school?
Not only has that never happened, it doesn't even make sense for a person to bring gasoline with them when attacking a school. It's heavy and cumbersome, and emits highly flammable vapors, which is a problem when you're also firing a gun in close proximity. Also, that would cause the fire alarm to go off, so the FD would show up. Furthermore, the fire dept. knows which alarm was triggered and where that alarm is in the school, so the shooter's location would've been exposed by doing that."
"738","What a fine way to get shot in front of all your friends... The point of hiding is to make the room look empty and uninteresting. If a shooter sees/hears no one and can't get in because the door is locked, chances are they'll move on (unless they have a personal vendetta against someone they know is in the room). The time wasted looking for a room that isn't locked also gives police time to arrive and find the shooter. 
Schools teach kids to do this because it works reduces the risk of being killed or hurt. If everyone lost their mind and started running out the doors like a bunch of animals, many more people would be hurt that could've been safe if they would've just stayed in the damn classroom."
"739","Work on your English"
"740","Kinda sensetive I guess but I like it!"

Good offensive humor."

"744","why do people disagree? imagine you in school and all of a sudden a psycho path comes and shoots everybody what are you gonna do then?"
"745","thats good"
"746","+Heather Snethern oh"
"747","+Adan Paiz Actually some of the teacher's at my daughter school do carry guns. They had to go through special training for it."
"748","Throw one chair at the gunman first so you have more time to run"
"749","Im pretty sure thats what any normal person would do lol if there was a school shooting i wouldnt even fucking duck under the tables like the teacher says but smash a window and gtfo"

"761","+Minezxda55 We were taught to huddle up in the far corner of the room and lock the door..Dammit."
"762","Holy Shit! Where is this! Like do you live in america!"
"763","yeah but what if theres more than one shooter with more than a glock"
"764","True, but it's not the gun it's the people behind it using it. The gun can shoot on its own it has to have the power to take action."
"765","+TheYellowFlowergirl state your sources"
"766","+EmVinci15 hnestly yes, the lock being on the inside is gonna be harder to shoot, but we all know it's located somewhere near the handle/push bar thing. and shooters don't usually come with only a few bullets"
"767","+EmVinci15 bullets break locks"
"768","I see what you're saying but not all shooters are that way. Like Sandy hook the son killed his mom but before getting to his mom he killed innocent kids. Also I remember some university few years ago a guy had a target on who he wanted to kill but how angry he was he ended up killing a couple of students on campus. I haven't heard about at least one shooter going in a school killing the target I always hear about multiple kills"
"769","+Ecko Kaijin ..."
"770","+Emily Whitlow probably someone who didnt know if he was going to live because the class next door attracted a possible shooter because they were being rowdy"

"773","+Emily Whitlow it would of been an emergency."
"774","U who would say f**** when there is kids "
"775","Ok heres a story if that ACTUALLY happened. Ill make it quick. 2 Criminal# watching tv ""Breaking news: Guns given to teachers to defend classrooms."" Criminal 1 ""Aye lets apply as teachers coz the new gun dealerz dead!"" Criminal 2 ""Aight lets go"" (One applies at the school, the other doesnt. Gets the job YAY!!) Criminal 1 and 2 make a plan. Plan is one of them to start the drill and the other gets the gunz and SHOOT ALL OF EM"
"776","+Anonymous Vigilante It's all optional but the gun use training would be a big part of it! How to load it and give it maintenance that sort of stuff!"
"777","But what if a teacher is having issue's?"
"778","Lol. This country is so fucked."
"779","Only five minutes? My school's lock down drills last HOURS. It's eerie. You have to turn off all the lights and hide, while staying completely silent. All you hear is other people's breathing, your own heartbeat, and the clock ticking. And then you hear the footsteps. Running towards you, and even though you know it's a drill, you feel nervous. Would they really tell us if it wasn't a drill? Would they say it's fake so we would stay calm? Sometimes, the police running the drill will suddenly ram the door, breaking the silence and scaring the pants off of everyone. Maybe if guns were controlled better, we wouldn't have idiots shooting up schools."
"780","The amount of anti-American/""America is dumb"" comments here is just getting silly now."
"781","I live in NJ and at my school all we do is a simple sit in the corner with the door locked and the lights off drill.  The principal comes on and says it's a lockdown, never says if it's a drill or not.  But we don't have some guy coming through the halls with a pressurized air gun like that. "
"782","White Devils smh"

"789","It's time to start screaming... what the fuck kind ridiculous shit that? What will screaming accomplish besides inform the shooter of their location! They need defense tactics, not to scream and hope for the best! Launa Hall, if a shooter ever comes into your school, YOU will be the reason someone might die. I sure as hell wouldn't wanna be stuck in that kind of situation with someone like you."

"793","If u hear gunshots I'm out... I'm not staying in the school"
"794","I don't think they should be announced because I remember being in highschool about a year ago lol and we would always play around during drills. An unannounced one can make one take it seriously. Usually I'd walk during fire drills but one day we had an unannounced one. I ran like Momma was on my ass."
"795","Um in my school and my classes are the worst my gosh like they start talk and can't just shut their mouth for 20sec even when the teacher says to close their mouths!!!! I mean if their was a real shooting drill! I think my class room would of been the first or the second to get killed"

"805","It's horrendous that these are required in American schools. After the Dunblane massacre in the UK we passed very strict guns laws, thankfully there's been no school shootings since and British children are free from the fear of a gunman ever coming onto school premises to murder them. I actually can't image going to school with a constant fear that something like what happened in Sandy Hook or Columbine could happen to me. "
"806","They crasy i would have threw a chair at the window and climbed out"
"807","I got a technique that will stop and active shooter real fast. My gun. Too bad that in most places that active shooters target I'm not allowed to carry guns. I have seriously contemplated carrying in those places anyway. Its not like anyone would know and my gun is not going to just go off in those places.  "
"808","americans...."
"809","Honestly I think this is actually a good idea. It doesn't only help you practice but it puts you in a situation where there's actually a person instead of the staff walking around silently and wiggling door knobs. This puts you in a state of realism. If the parents are angry because the students got scared of a drill the  how are they going to feel when it actually happens and they don't know what to do? It would be the parents fault for complaining."

Doors are locked and curtains are shut and we all stay close to the walls under our desks but honestly since we have started these drills it has just made me more aware of how unprotected we are. A shooter can break a door or window and has a full classroom of unarmed terrified teenagers to shoot at. I can't imagine how scary it must be for a child"

"817","If death note was real kids should have a death note with them they can write his name or they should tear the pages and let the shooter touch it and the shimigami appears and scaring the shooter and he runs away and screaming."
"818","The question is, should teachers be armed? At least with concealed handguns as to not scare the children, then again a number of teachers could become perpetrators themselves now that their permitted to carry a handgun around with them, so what if the handguns were armed with rubber bullets first and even adding to that precaution, the guns would be limited to 2-4 magazines. Also ""blanket bullet proof materials"" should be developed, because individual vest for each student would be a waste of resources so as the students either hide or escape, they could travel in groups where the blankets would protect up to 3-7 kids at a time. These blankets would be stocked in cabinets and once a single gunshot is heard, the materials would be deployed immediately and teachers would aim steadily at the doors with their rubber bullets while large groups of students would huddle together behind/under bulletproof blankets. 10-40 armed teachers guarding their own respective classrooms would confine the perpetrators to the hallways where they would be rendered sitting ducks for first responding law enforcement."

Is there gonna be a drill for police stealing your shit as well?"
"825","Haha England! Also she says she thought the police men were gonna kill her? Ofcourse....makes perfect sense "
"826","This is stupid, they shouldn't have to wait worried, the teachers should be armed and trained. If a teacher has a gun trained at the door then BOOM all the kids are safe. Anyone could kill a bunch of kids in a school with a knife, situations in china where 27 people were killed in a shopping mall by a guy with a BOX CUTTER NO GUNS! They have some of the strictest gun laws! Guns aren't the problem, its mentally insane people! Don't make us law abiding citizens have to fight for our guns, because the fact is we will win every time. If you can't deport 17 million illegals from the US what makes you think you can deport 300 million+ guns from the hands of trained citizens? Its basic logic and common sense its physically impossible. Even if ""gun control"" was implemented in the US it would be 100% physically impossible to take away the guns! you might get a couple hundred but we would fight to the death for liberty. Once gun control would be implemented we would gather gun a militia and overthrow the government and make a new one as the constitution tells us is our duty. We have the ""right of rebellion"" which means that it is our DUTY (not right) should a government become oppressive for the people to overthrow it and make a new one based upon our key principals and constitution. The constitution entitles us to fight the government at ALL costs and to defend the constitution at ALL costs. The constitution says ""We the people are the rightful government"" which means that we decide what happens and it also says that we do not have to follow oppressive laws put in place by a one man government, therefore ANY AND ALL executive orders are illegal and not to be followed. I think its time we start to take our country back and have ""Liberty and justice for all"". Now onto the point of mentally insane people, if they are caught red handed shooting people they dont need to sit in jail for 2 years before going to trial, the constitution says we are all entitled to due process of law which says that we need a quick and speedy trial. They don't deserve to sit in jails we paid for and eat food we paid for and sleep on beds we paid for. They need to be put to trial within a month or so and put to death via firing squad, enough of this using lethal injection. Was he nice enough to put those people down easy? NO! He needs a bullet to the heart, its faster and saves us thousand and thousands of dollars! Back in the old days they could have used lethal injection, they sure had the stuff to do it, but they chose that someone that horrible doesn't deserve the easy way out! The law in Texas (where i live) still states that if a horse thief is caught red handed he is to be hanged at the nearest tree! (of course they NEVER do that) but that still says something. If someone can be killed immediately for stealing a horse back in the day why do these evil worthless filth of the earth killers get to live in luxury for 2 years in a mental hospital? Screw that, if i was in a mall and a guy started shooting he will be killed! My family ALWAYS has a gun in the car with us, and when I turn 18 I will be keeping my 12 gauge in the trunk of my car (unloaded and locked as teh law states) because I cant carry a loaded weapon in my car at 18, and you have to be 21 and go to classes to carry a loaded pistol in Texas. Its not how to brits think it is here, only the criminals break laws (derp derp) Stay in your country because you already lost that fight once, do you really wanna lose it again? "

"828","+Hannah Wilkinson in china a man went on a stabbing spree and killed 22 people. i believe that with the right regulations guns can be safer. but an absolute ban of firearms for civilians? thats absurd"
"829","Trust me. The real thing is terrifying; and you are quite glad that lock down drills (as stupid as they may seem) are held in the first place. They give a sense of procedure. A sense of what to do in an emergency. Even if that 'what to do' part isn't the best."
"830","+Nicole Harris I've never experienced a 'real threat', but when I was in third or fourth grade there was a lock down because a skunk walked into the school. That same year there was a bomb threat in the high school down the street from us and we were evacuated from our elementary school just in case. We waited in a nearby church while our parents came to get us."
"831","+Hannah Wilkinson Its even worse in a real situation. I've gone through lock downs for bomb threats, and suspicious people on school grounds. I was elementary school when the local high school had a bomb threat. The worst was a suspicious person on the grounds of one of the elementary schools in my district. It happened during a severe thunder storm. Nobody was allowed to leave on a bus, and our parents had to wait in the lobby to pick us up."
"832","+Lucifer The Great Actually, they are. You don't see people going into schools and stabbing people to death. The fact that anyone is able to get their hands on dangerous weapons so easily is absolutely and ridiculously idiotic."

"855","You could say that about any drill they practice mane, including fire drills. In fact willing to bet way more kids have died from school shootings in the past 20-30 years then they have from fires yet a fire drill is considered a normal precaution. "
"856","+alina wilson
Shut the fuck up! PTSD is for soldiers and Police. Your fucking kid will forget in a matter of days. STOP making this into something it isn't. Mass killings happen everywhere. In China there are coordinated mass stabbings which injure over 100 people and kill 30, and it ain't that uncommon. In the UK (where there is a weapons ban) they have a higher violent crime rate than the US.

You don't see them calling for more gun control, because that didn't work. Their children don't have PTSD, and your children won't have PTSD.

You know who will have PTSD? THE CHILDREN IN SYRIA! They will be shot, they will be beheaded, they will lose loved ones, they will starve, they will die from infection, and they wont have a home.

Grow up America.

"857","+Vance Stone I realize you probably did not mean to come off that way, but your comment sounds incredibly callous.  ""99 percent of the time there's less than three kills...aren't catastrophic"".  It sounds like you are diminishing the damage of these events. This is horrific, this is not something that we should have to just deal with, or just figure out.  It isn't the common cold.  These events are physically, mentally, and emotionally damaging, even if it's just loud noise to you it is totally debilitating. Hello PTSD.   Again, I realize you probably didn't mean it the way that it sounded, but I had to respond.  "

"901","No one was killed. This was a drill"
"902","It is sad that in this instance law enforcement was not more direct in executing a IARD (Immediate Action Rapid Deployment) to respond to the threat more rapidly. Active shooter situations are unique in that the perp is not interested in anything other than creating as many victims possible, and they nearly always result in the perps suicide when law enforcement closes in on them. Why? because these cowards are only interested in the defenseless. Once it is fair fight, the shooter punches out in short order. They are generally not interested in involving themselves in gun battles with responding police or SWAT units, except to maybe buy time as they flee to commit suicide or create more victims. In most of the instances in which law enforcement has managed to capture or kill these shooters, it has been the result of poor planning or execution on the part of the shooter, mostly because they drastically miscalculate the response time of police or their lack of understanding in police procedure in responding to these types of incidents. They have perhaps 5 min tops from the time they fire the first shot until they can expect to be confronted by law enforcement, and in many instances far less. 

 Most of these people are angry at the world over the way they have been treated, or at least the way they perceive they have been treated. This is payback for them. The nightmare scenario for this individual is to be hog tied and carried out of the building in cuffs to be subsequently tossed in the back of a squad car. They seek to deny society of it's chance at retribution, and capture or death at the hands of the police stands in start contrast to this. Sure, the perp is still dead, but they are dead as a result of their own actions, and not the (direct anyway) actions of law enforcement. This is their final act of defiance, which is essentially a narcissistic notion stating that ""It's all about me, I call the shots, I say how things go down, etc"". People with this level of sadistic delusion are terrifying, but also fascinating from a psychology standpoint."

"914","To delude yourself into believing that these fantastical conspiracies exist is simply bizarre to me.  Some times this awful stuff happens simply because a sick and evil guy got his mom's assault rifle and went on a killing spree.  If he used a hatchet or poisonous gas, would that some how make this tragedy more believable?!   Does that mean that every massacre involving an assault weapon is a hoax perpetrated by proponents of an assault weapons ban?  Or is it only Sandy Hook because after the slaughter of 20 children it was just easier to call it a hoax than argue against the ban.  To extract some government plot through nothing more than unsubstantiated media reports, unreasonable inferences, supposition and gossip is utter nonsense. "

Just a thought, and I'm not trying to be argumentative with you at all because my mind is remaining open, but... if there were some sort of cover up, regardless of if it were a massive or small one. Wouldn't the official reports be the best way to NOT find out about it? I imagine the same agencies releasing the official reports would be the agencies at work in the instance of a cover up and it's perpetuation.
I look forward to your input and thanks!"

I wonder which book is from a revelation from God."
"1008","My apology to all my christian friends if I were to offend anybody. In U.S there were few cases happened where THOUSANDS of innocent ppl are killed. Lets take for instance, the Jim Jones  massacre where thousands of innocent childrens and ppl died of drinking cyanide. I blame the bible for being exploited by authors who call themselves Paul, Mark, Mathew and Luke. The bible says that true Christians can speak in foreign tongues and they will not be harm by poison or deadly snakes. When put to the test............every christians have a painful death. I wonder if God Al Mighty is capable of lying in the bible and taking the lives of innocents ppl by a thousands. Logic tells us christianity is a man made religion. Christianity is not mention in the bible."
"1009","America is always  busy fighting a war which they called terrorism. But the acrual terrorists existed from within their own citizens.

The best part is ......it has many pcychopath ppl on killing spree gunning down innocent childrens in schools,  brutal killings of the innocents in cinema and in public places too. The stastic shows that armed robberies happened every 5 minutes in all parts of USA. What a filthy country with full of terrorists."

"1015","Ok so people keep saying guns are bad and should be banned. I have to politely disagree, what about the people that use guns for safety? Ever here about the woman who saved herself and her kid with a gun? Plus banning guns is impossible. There are dealers who could still have access to guns and trying to get rid of them is useless. I'm not saying that guns should be free to  everyone, but I am saying it's impossible to get guns completely banned."

You can't just take the guns away from everyone because of a few crazy people.

"1087","+nikeducks24 I understand your arguments. I am from Holland so raised in a very different culture. In Holland people are allowed to have weapons if they have the right papers. There was one mass shooting in Holland by an 18 year old licensed guy who killed 9 people. I think you create a society that I wouldn´t wanne live in. Most murders here is by maffia with illegal weapons. How many children are killed every year in the USA by guns? In Holland that never happens!  So, enough reason to ban them."
"1088","+Roel Allart A girl who usually carried a Glock in her purse was going to college in a gun free zone and she was not able to carry it with her. She was going to go to her car and a man came up behind her and took her to his car and raped her. Later on the same man murdered a woman and he was caught. The girl that was raped said if she was able to carry a gun with her that the other girl would still be alive. Also Chicago, one of the worst crime zone in the US, also one of the most gun free zones in the US. There are still ways to get guns from the black market, and when everyone is disarmed they won't be able to defend themselves from the people who bought the guns off the black market. One more thing Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, the British tried to take them away from the American colonies to control the people more from the revolution rising. So no banning weapons will not work."

LETS PROTECT OURSELVES AND PROTECT OTHERS! SEND ME IDEAS I WANT TO LISTEN."
"1091","If u look at polling on gun control after the last 5 mass shooting events gun control favorability increases 5% so by my math there'd have to be 20 school shootings with no less than 25 dead in a year to move public opinion to 80% support for gun control laws.

Trouble is, the second amendment to the United States Constitution seems to present a thorn in their collective sides.  So, they want to undermine it, in order to destroy the Blacks and Whites.  
You have heard of Manchurian candidates and MK Ultra?  Well, how about Freemasonry creating some to undertake mass shootings, to encourage the wider public to reject the amendment?  It would be particularly convenient if the shooters died and never gave any information.  
When the American people identify the enemy within, oppressive Satanic agents-for-China, they may act against the crime with arms - despite the Samson option.

Have you ever shot a gun or heard one?  It sounds like plywood snapping.  Not a thud.  Mind you, no panic was going on after the event.  Most of the children, parents, and teachers were extremely calm.  No bodies were removed from the school.  I guess they just fucking left corpses in there? And 100s of bullets were spraying down the halls.  Yet no one was injured and no bullet holes/markings/ext were found?  Wake the fuck up."

At that time, the U.S. was a young country, the organized armed forces small and difficult to quickly move around vast spaces, and there were plenty of enemies abroad. Hence it was felt (probably correctly so) that the need for the availability of an armed militia existed - every citizen to have a gun at home to help defend the country in times of crises <b>if</b> called to arms. No personal aspect in there at all.
Also - just saying - in 1791 a gun was not envisioned to fire 100+ bullets per minute."
"1428","America make's me sick. How many School kids should die before they stop Selling guns too the public."
"1429","Once again the media has become saturated with images of another instance of a tragic massacre where an unstable assailant driven by motives which no rational individual could understand has taken the lives of almost thirty men, women and children. Now around thirty families are probably stricken with a profound grief that any whose lives have not been tragically inflicted by violence could understand. One can help but not feel vulnerable since these senseless crimes can happen anywhere and at any time. Men driven by an irrational hatred and rage strike suddenly and seem completely unfeeling about the pain and loss they will cause and often don't even seem to care of their own welfare. Understandably people ask what is the cause of these horrific events, could it be the availability of military grade weaponry in some nations or a global popular culture where violence is pervasive and sometimes even glamorized. Many are shocked by such events and even angered which is natural, for we all want ourselves and those for whom we care to live in safety and not be stricken down by sudden acts of violence. Our leaders and those in authority promise to act and make the world in which we live safer, yet sometimes the solutions to these occurrences of violence may escape even the most learned amongst us. Any society will mostly be made up of those who will contribute to it, but there will always be a small few who will threaten that society for numerous and varied reasons. People are justifiably scared, not only for themselves but for those they care for, and some may even feel powerless to protect them. So what can be done some may ask.
	In most of the recent cases of these tragic mass shootings the culprits responsible had been known to be troubled before they carried out their crimes. The shooter responsible for the attack on a female politician in Arizona was known to his college piers to be deeply troubled before those events transpired. The man responsible for the massacre at Virginia Tech was known to be problematic, his teachers and fellow students all knew this. In fact in most of these cases the culprit displayed behavior that many found disturbed and troubling. Though most of these men had no criminal record, they displayed tendencies that most saw as disturbed. So it stands to reason that such men display tendencies which may indicate they could threaten others.
	Though I am adamantly opposed to any type of pre-crime where a person is punished not for what they have done but for what they might do, perhaps mental health officials should be able to institutionalize those who may display behavior which indicates they could threaten others. But this theoretical institutionalization would not be permanent, perhaps through therapy and other new methods these men could be released back into society if those involved in their treatment deem them to be safe and capable of being productive members of society. Perhaps both places of employment and academic institutions should have an legal apparatus available so they can notify mental health care providers of individuals who may display tendencies which indicate they may hurt others in the future. But such men are not to be punished but are taken out of society until psychiatric professionals determine them to be safe and no longer and danger to others or themselves. The solution could be treatment and not punishment before such tragic crimes occur.
	Such crimes cause grief to many and currently the public rightfully demands action, and perhaps precautions could be taken to prevent even more families losing someone they love needlessly. At least that is my view on the problem."

"1458","+Colin Pitts Fuck you they are made to kill people."
"1459","+MickDansforth First, you are wrong.  A firearm's function is to launch a projectile much like a bow an arrow, or a potato launcher, a nail gun ect.  What is in front of the projectile is completely dependent on the USER or the people that are holding the gun.  Once more, statistically, there are over 300 million firearms in the United States and there are only around 9,000 homicides with firearms.  So well over 99% of all firearms are being used incorrectly according to you?  They are being used to target practice, to shoot skeet, for competition in national leagues, for family bonding time, for personal defense, and for display/ collection.  

The black panthers were famous for open carrying rifles in rallies to display their rights as free men.  They never shot anyone, or engaged the police in a firefight, but the racists (like yourself) screamed and cried that this was the end of the world because free men had access to firearms.  *the real issue with all of your claims is that they are based off of some imagined reality that hasn't taken place*  you imagine that open carrying of firearms MIGHT end poorly but they don't.  You imagine that places with more firearms will have more homicide and they don't.  You imagine that people that carry guns are more dangerous and they aren't.  You have no evidence, all you have is name calling and internet trolling. "

You realize that our police force is far more capable to catch criminals and investigate domiciles then when they wrote the 4th amendment or 5th amendment right?  You realize that there are more religions and different sects of religions being practices in the United States than when they wrote freedom of religions into the 1st amendment right?

There was the most restrictive ""assault weapon ban"" in place when the Columbine shooting occurred and it didnt do a thing to prevent it.  Your logic would be used to say drug wars and violence could have been avoided if drug laws were improved.  Or deaths by drunk driving could be avoided by alcohol laws being improved.  We have seen example after example of laws being a poor solution to stope people from killing others, education rather, is the best method.


You teach people not to drink and drive and the rate of drunk driving goes down but when alcohol was banned it did nothing.  You teach people not to take drugs for the health reasons but banning them does nothing to stop their use an importation into the Country.  You teach people sex education to stop mistakes and underage pregnancy which has been far more effective than laws agains underage sex or sex outside of marriage.  Your argument when applied to anything else in the world is found to be lacking even the basics in common deductive reasoning."

It doesn't make sense and, oh wait, I know the reason why you keep referring back to the 2nd amendment. Its nearly the only valid point that you can argue in a situation when someone goes ""I think they should ban guns in America"" It is pure common sense to make them illegal because if you did, you wouldn't have psychopaths with a sniper rifle in their shed being like ""Well it isn't against the law is it?"" ""No you are right Bob, it isn't against the law. Go ahead and stock up on military grade weapons and ammunition while we just blindly think you are just trying to protect your property"" Seriously that is what you sound like. And don't give me that ""ITS OUR RIGHT COS IM A CITIZEN OF 'MERICA"". Just because it was signed on some paper hundreds of years ago doesn't mean it completely stops the possibility of making guns illegal. Let me give an example: America - Is famous for some of the most brutal mass shootings. Guns = Legal, Hundreds of mass shootings , Britain - Is famous for its football and tea. Guns = Illegal, (Not sure on exact amount of mass shootings but lets say something like..) lower double digits. France - Is famous for its beautiful Cities and countryside and its baguettes. Guns = Illegal, (Again not sure on exact amount of mass shootings but lets say something like...) lower double digits.

While yes this small list is not entirely accurate (Probably) it does still bring up some key points about guns being legal in America. Guns being illegal = Happier Country. Happier Country= Better economy. It is common sense and to think most Americans throw away this sense because ""Its our right"" is pure stupidity and I hope as decent Human beings we can all see that.


Note: I am aware there was no need for all of this but it annoys me how some Americans seem to argue guns being illegal is wrong and they always come out on top. I am also aware that some information given is probably false. Most of this was written based on confident knowledge and understanding and, of course, fact!

"1592","+Nil C. I wasn't trying to insinuate that you don't know what you are talking about just pointing it out.  I assumed it isn't your first language which is fine you speak it well enough to hold a conversation.

The point of the comparison is that nations have issues with homicide no matter what their laws are regarding firearms.  It is not firearms that lead to homicdies as is made completely clear by these examples.  So what you have to ask yourself is where the majority of homicides come from in the United States.  The answer, is poverty stricken inner cities and gang violence ridden slums with the addition of drug wars perpetuated by the fact that the US has the most lucrative market for illicit drugs.  

Now looking at greenland, Yes they have less inhabitants but we can compare them to states like Vermont.  Vermont has laws in the books that allow the carrying of firearms without a permit and has one of the highest firearm ownership in all of the United states and also has the lowest homicide rate.  So if there are tons of firearms in Vermont and no firearms in Greenland why is it that vermont has homicide rates that are under most european nations even with a small population?  Look into it. 

Lastly, its not ideologies.  Its poverty, drugs, and social issues.  The soccer mom who owns firearms is not the one that is perpetuating the murders in the US.  It is the drug dealers, the gang members and the impoverished.  All of which european powers have far less of which accounts for their lower homicide rates. "
"1593","+Colin Pitts Sorry, English is my third language, I am still learning (thank you anyway).

If you want to compare USA with countries like Brazil or Russia... ok, it is up to you. Those are one of the most violent and corrupt countries in the world, definitely not a good example to be compared with. Greenland has 55,000 inhabitants... come on. This is like you comparing the US with a bad neighbourhood of some town.

Switzerland is maybe the most pacifist and neutral country of the world. USA is obviously not. Completely different idiologies. "
"1594","+Nil C. First of, that is a double negative "" don't know nobody who has"" would mean everyone you know has a firearm because you don't know of any individual who doesn't  have one. 

Second off, Your claim that less guns means less killing is quite obviously false.  There are several case studies for this.  Russia has a fraction of the firearms that the US does but has DOUBLE the homicide rate of the US.  Brazil has a ban on firearms and has a homicide rate of 9 times the US.  Greenland has almost 5 times the homicide rate of the US with little no firearm ownership.  

Conversely, Switzerland has more than double the firearms ownership of any european nation and has less homicides than France, Germany, the UK or Australia.  In fact, they have HALF the homicide rate of all nations with heavy gun control.  Your claim lacks any statistical or circumstantial basis. "
"1595","+Colin Pitts With mid or late 20 year old is still difficult and rare to have a gun here (nobody does). I have never seen a gun in my life and I don't know nobody who has. 
So my point is the same: Less guns, less ""killing power"". Quite obvious. 

You have a bunch of examples (children and young adults):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States#List_of_U.S._school_attacks

"1596","+Nil C. ""Could have"" is bad justification for sweeping regulation and restriction of personal liberties.  Someone ""could have"" used freedom of speech and expression to insight racially motivated insurrection (Nazi Germany) but that does not justify the restriction or elimination of the right to express oneself.  

Now, there have been very few (if any) mass shootings committed by 13year olds in the US or other nations with a right to bear arms so this point is rather moot.  Most shootings are committed by late teenagers to mid to late 20 year olds.  Plenty old enough to acquire weapons or knowledge to produce household explosives like the Boston Bombers or the Aurora shooter who had homemade tear gas and explosives set up in his apartment for police responders.  The argument than ""gun control"" saved people from a deranged 13 year old child is without any rational basis or evidence as there are very few if any examples of 13 year olds using firearms to commit mass murder even in nations with firearms freedoms. "

"1604","+Dan Kumar Okay but how do you weigh those tragic events stacked up against the tragic events that would have happened should the victim not have had a firearm?  There are estimations of defensive gun uses in the millions: http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf

More than 1 million times a year, a law abiding gun owner is using their firearm to defend themselves agains violent crime, and you get one or two of those tragic events like the one described above.  It doesn't make those events any less tragic, but it really puts it into perspective.  Best case scenario for a gun ban would be:  1 million more successful violent crime incidents, no change in the overall gun use by those that are already prohibited to use or buy firearms, and maybe one or two people saved from incidents like that which is described above.  There are ten fold the amount of defensive gun uses in the US than there is murders or gun accidents so basing an argument around the two is simply lacking factual support. "
"1605","+Colin Pitts I really agree with your statement

 'Restricting weapons won't work because the only people that will listen to the restriction will be the ones that you have nothing to fear from.' 


Now the reason for it being banned that would benefit is from tragic accidents did you hear about the kid that shot his mother to death because she had a gun for protection in her bag and countless other tragic accidents cause by guns lying around now i understand that a lot people use guns correctly but even those people could be involved in accidents as bad as that if guns were to be illegal people with guns lying around or with them could be noticed and this could stop a lot of violence  now i have also after reading your statement above realised if guns were illegal a lot of bigger organised crime groups would get mass amounts of guns and start benefiting from huge amount of money they would make by selling them to smaller criminals or people that feel the need to acquire a gun so from this i see where you are coming from.
In my country we have guns illegal and we have had a very positive life compared to America where we don't even  come close to the amount of gun violence where we are but yes we have a much smaller population and yes still only a short while ago man took a cafe hostage with a gun that he probably got from some black market which makes it obvious that banning guns doesn't stop violence but it  COULD be a way to make a move and change your country as far as i know yours? Im from Australia."
"1606","+Dan Kumar Frankly legalizing marijuana would reduce the crime and bloodshed associated with the drug trade.  The fact is that because there is no other source to get it from other than violent drug dealers working in some shape or form for large cartels contributes to the violence.  If it was available else ware there would be less money for the violent criminals selling the stuff. 

Think about it this way.  When alcohol was illegal in the US back in the early 20th century, where was the only place that you could get it from? Bootleggers that worked for the Mob and the like of Al capone.  Because there was still a huge market for alcohol, and the only way people could get it was to pay Capone and the italian Mob, they became more powerful, much like the cartels of modern day.  When competition came up, the mob would kill them much like the cartels today.  When the cops tried to intervene, the mob killed them and others around them much like the drug runners and cartels today. 

Restricting weapons won't work because the only people that will listen to the restriction will be the ones that you have nothing to fear from.  All it will do is give cartels another product to sell to a market that still wants guns.  Legal citizens in the US carrying firearms are less likely to kill an innocent person than police in the US.  They are less likely to kill you than a car accident, or slipping in the bathtub, or falling down the stairs.  So why is getting guns out of the hands of these people such a priority?  History already tells us that its not going to do anything to the career criminal, so why go after these peaceful peoples rights and best defense?"
"1607","+Colin Pitts Ok i agree that  moronic people are to blame when it comes to problems in society but would legalising marijuana help solve  these problems with turf wars if everyone can get there hands on the drug and there wouldn't be as much of a high demand in areas , and what you say is true people do  get violent to do with drugs at times but guns do play heavily in the violence so you cant really say that as a example when the guns are used to put out the violence. the reason the violence occurs is because these people are greedy and have access to weapons not marijuana."
"1608","+Dan Kumar You are very wrong.  The drug cartels make a majority of their money selling marijuana.  It is the most popular illicit drug in the United States.  The deaths that have occurred in the drug wars, the turf wars between rival dealers, and the senseless violence on both sides of the borders resulting from the greed has killed far more.  

In and of itself the firearm is responsible for nothing.  It hasn't caused anything.  marijuana in and of itself hasn't caused anything.  It is all people.  Someone can smoke marijuana and be as peaceful as can be. But another can deal the drug to that same individual and be a convicted murderer.  By the same token the vast majority of gun owners in the United States are very responsible peaceful people.  It is that one lunatic that uses it for nefarious purposes and that is never justification for taking away a right. "

"1632","+Снаяои cry I am referring to the larger question of why there is even an argument about guns in the first place.  In order to be logically consistent, there should be an argument about cars every time there is a bad car accident, a conversation about food every time there is a contaminate, a drug argument every time there is a suicide accomplished with drugs legal or illegal.  The point is, we don't do this with anything else, for some reason peoples reasons and logic go out the window with guns because of irrational fear. 

""Sure, you can skew certain results to make it seem worse than it actually is, but I don't see how that could be done with gun violence. Either a gun was used, or a gun wasn't used. ""

Very easily.  You see, the narrative that you and other gun control supporters want to create is that guns are the problem and the problem that is guns is spread out all over the nation because of the gun availability.  To do this you compare the United States 'gun violence' stats against EU nations and think you are right.  However, you ignore where all the numbers come from.  Its not evenly spread across the country, its consolidated in high crime areas, high poverty areas, high gang violence areas ect.  THESE are the factors that bring about death and gun violence not gun laws.  The places in the nation with the most guns and the least restrictive gun control laws often have the lowest rates of gun violence and some of the lowest rates of homicide. 

""Also, in your example of Hawaii vs. Arizona, you tacitly admit that the more guns around, the more gun violence there will be. So wouldn't the obvious cure for that problem be to get rid of guns?""

Wow, you managed to completely and utterly miss the point.  I can't figure out if you are smart so you are doing this on purpose to avoid hard question or the other way around.  Allow me to make this clear *Gun violence is no worse than any other type of violence if the end result is the same*.  In my example, it doenst matter that there are more drownings in Hawaii because that doesnt mean there are less overall accidental deaths in Arizona.  It just means that SPECIFIC type of accident is more present in Hawaii because there is more water in Hawaii.  

Your argument is like removing all poisonous materials from your house when there is a young child and saying there is no way for the child to die now.  Yet, you don't take out small things for them to choke on, you don't bar stairs that they can fall down, you don't take out sharp objects ect.  You are so focused on the poisonous substances and you think this fixes EVERYTHING that you don't even consider that the child could be harmed and be equally dead by something else.  Criminals are criminals.  When they don't have a gun to mug someone they aren't going to go get a job and a 401k.  If they get by as a mugger, they are going to mug.  You gun violence may go down but people are still being robbed and raped and assaulted. 

""Might I add, you've failed to show my lack of comprehension in statistics, all you've shown is that in a conversation about one particular topic, I failed to mention unrelated topics. ""

I had never said that gun violence was the same as homicide.  Homicide was brought into this argument because that is the reason why people are scared of guns.  If you don't like the color of them and that keeps you up at night that I suppose this doesnt apply to you.  Just take a hot second to think about it for once.  Why is gun violence a problem?  Oh yeah!  Its because it can result in death!  So if a country with all this gun violence and all these guns has places were there are tons of guns and little to no gun violence OR homicide, we can conclude that there are other factors at play in the areas that do display high rates of homicide in that same nation and that the variable GUNS is not to blame. "
"1633","+Colin Pitts You ask why focus on the weapon used, well, because that is what is being discussed. In an argument about guns, why bring up other weapons, just like in an argument about drownings, why bring up automobile accidents. Sure, you can skew certain results to make it seem worse than it actually is, but I don't see how that could be done with gun violence. Either a gun was used, or a gun wasn't used. Also, in your example of Hawaii vs. Arizona, you tacitly admit that the more guns around, the more gun violence there will be. So wouldn't the obvious cure for that problem be to get rid of guns? I don't actually advocate banning all guns, but in this particular example the piece fits the puzzle. Might I add, you've failed to show my lack of comprehension in statistics, all you've shown is that in a conversation about one particular topic, I failed to mention unrelated topics. "
"1634","+Снаяои cry So you use misunderstanding of statistics to show that you understand them? What kind of circular argument is that? 

The United States is not the #1 nation in gun violence.  I cite you Brazil, I cite you Mexico. 

Your misunderstanding of statistics is most apparent in your callous disregard for comparison.  When you compare Hawaii and Arizona for something like drowning deaths for example, you would except that a state surrounded by water would have far more drowning deaths.  This is the same with firearms.  The US has more *gun violence* than many nations.  However, if those nations have more overall violence or more overall death, why does it matter the tool used?  If you look at the US and compare it to Argentina exclaiming ""look how much less shooting deaths there are in Argentina!"" and then ignore that Argentina has a higher homicide rate per capita you clearly don't even grasp statistics 101.  

Mark Twain said ""There are three kinds of lies; lies, damned lies, and statistics.""  This is because you can makes statistics say whatever you want them to say.  If I want to say there are children dying from guns in the US, I can define ""children"" as anyone under the age of 26 and get a far higher number than what people commonly think of as children. 

If I want statistics to say there is a ""mass shooting"" epidemic in the US, I define a ""mass shooting"" as any shooting involving 4 people and I can include most gang shootings as mass shootings which artificially enhances my numbers. "
"1635","+Colin Pitts The fact that people liked this comment shows that I am apparently the only person on YouTube who understands statistics.

The teachers can beat their head against the wall but if the parents can't afford/ don't want to take their child to treatment where are we left?  Parents are already not taking children to the help that they need so how does this fix anything?

So the problem comes down to, you are vesting quite a bit of power in grade school teachers.  Not to say that they are not trustworthy, but you also have to think about liability.  Teachers don't make that much money; would they be willing to insinuate that a child needs mental evaluation and risk a lawsuit if that child turns out not to need evaluation and there was nothing wrong with them?  Or worse, if they don't recommend evaluation then are they held responsible for a shooting that they ""should"" have seen coming?  All these questions are ones that _need_ to be answered."

"1661","+Hare Sassaf People forget that the United States is the home to almost every single major news outlet and even those that aren't american companies have large bases of operation in the US.  Most consumers of their product (information in the form of news) are in fact, American.  Someone figured out that fear, sex, violence, and gore sell big to their consumer market so every little shooting, killing, or gruesome event gets televised, revisited, and analyzed ten ways to sunday.  Then they all want to point to how ""twisted"" the US is because all these things are happening but when we actually look at the statistics we find that the US is not near as bad as many nations out there in the world with any of the things that it gets blamed for.  


For example, a tragedy occurs in the US where a boy stabs, shoots, and runs over a handful of people in California and almost EVERYONE can remember it and recall the weeks of analyzing and talking.  Over 300 people are shot to death in a pakistani school and the story is dead after a day."

Lithuania: Homicide rate= 6.7 part of the EU, still higher than the US
Russia: Homicide rate= 9.2 almost double the US with possible death penalty for firearms possession

So crime deaths are significantly lower in countries that have banned public purchase of a gun?  Why not in these places? If you are going to make a blanket statement like that you need your facts first.  And if you point to poverty of these places, awesome, the US has poverty in the places that inflate its homicide rates as well like Detroit.  Address the real problem.  There is no correlation between private firearm ownership and homicide rates.  Period.  "

Stubborn. The way you talk about it its just a subject to you. Something to prove others wrong on. In fact half the reason I made this was made to shit on Americas gun control and all that because I knew you would respond. It was like bait if you will.

I feel sorry for you and for America. Have fun with your life Θ_Θ"
"1670","+Sloshxf33 I do understand what opinions are, but what you said was suggestion of policy change based off of misinformation.  You would correct me if I suggested policy change based of my personal beliefs that happened to be racist (hypothetically).  Furthermore, if your opinion is able to be stated without contestation, 1)why post it on a public forum 2)why bash others opinions for critiquing your opinion (catch 22 much?) 3) If backing up opinion with statistics is wrong than should we all just scream and bicker without any evidence?  Just a free for all and who ever screams loudest gets to have their policy in place?

Great deduction, mass shootings include guns! But as i said, these shootings claim less lives per year than people falling in their bath tubs so, yes, it is ridiculous to say that this is some epidemic.  It is an unfortunate blue moon occurrence that is frankly no worse than the Arson, bombings, or other instances that I brought up.  Why does it matter if 10 kids are shot opposed to 10 being bombed?  

You continue to mention England and France and discount the rest of the world.  That is simply not how things work and if you can't see that then you are going to have to go scratch your head somewhere else.  Using two nations to prove something about the rest of the world is mathematically incorrigible.  

Finally, I find it rather ironic that you seem to be attacking my OPINION because it doesn't align with your opinion.  So yeah, ill end with this:

It became instantly apparent you had read my comment gone ""This guy knows nothing, I know what I will do, bang off 100 lines of fact that disapproves of his opinion"" What does that sound like? A smartass. And the fact that I used three nations does not matter. Its opinionated. Once again being a smartass. Also, mass SHOOTINGS tend to include guns. Which is what this video is about and is what my comment was about. I'm not talking about arson and bombs. Also please state why you seem to think that mass shootings rarely happen (which is what you're implying) because last time I checked, America is infamous for its mass shootings. Whereas a country like England or France (sorry I don't want to include 197 more, oh look at that, Math!) are less likely to be remembered (if at all) for mass shootings. Now judging by your given personality you'd probably jump on me saying ""America won't be remembered for its shootings"" which is why I will say no America will probably not be remembered for it shootings. Most likely for its obese population or rich and vibrant Cities. I hope you see where you have tripped up and have misunderstood I'm going to continue enjoying the fact that you seem to think this is a game of who knows more (couldn't give a shit if you knew about gun violence or not tbh).

"1674"," 
As a Canadian, I feel many of these gun-control comments are a bit misdirected. Places such as Canada are actually swimming in legal and illegal guns. I see it almost every day. We even have legal access to exactly the same firepower as those in the states (minus fully-automatic firearms), yet our crime rates are much lower.

I am convinced that violent crime is a function of class segregation, political climate, mental health issues/care, and cultural attitudes much more than anything to do with gun laws. I mean, how do we really legislate a psychopath from acquiring and using a dangerous device with malicious intent, whether it is buying a gun from a black market dealer or tearing open a bunch of icy hot patches for the ammonium nitrate? Maybe focusing our attention on getting people the help they need is a better use of our resources, instead of prohibiting inanimate pieces of steel to people who have done nothing wrong. Most gun control measures do not influence crime occurrences at all, but they make some of us feel good and it doesn't affect them personally so many of us jump on board.

Canada has been dismantling their gun control for years, yet their gun crime rates keep going down. Almost counter-intuitive right? In the end, it is easy to point at firearms as being the root of the problem in the U.S. if we convince ourselves that correlation means causation. We must all remain open-minded if we really want to make a difference.

- What type of mental illness does he have?
- How can we calibrate gun laws to make sure that people with mental illnesses do not get their hand on a weapon?

More Gun=More Crime?  I encourage you all to look at Mexico with it's nationwide ban on guns but with drug cartels dominating the country.  Look at Chicago, with the strictest gun control in the nation, but with the HIGHEST CRIME RATE.  Gun control has the *opposite effect*.

Look at Switzerland with it's open acceptance of firearms and it's LOW crime rates.

Anti-gun idiots also bring up Great Britain, with it's low gun murders.  Yet it's known as the *most violent country in Europe*.

1. Semi-automatics/Fully Automatics/Burst Fires makes killing easier
     I respect this argument, however you pick up about a hundred objects a day that can make killing easier. Just get behind a tractor with a stump grinder attached to it and have fun plowing over people while grinding them up either with the cylindrical saw or better yet have one of them vertical stump removers and having it facing forward as you're driving the damn thing, so when you come into contact with somebody as they're running, you'll be able to drill through their back, impaling their body, killing them. Yeah, pretty fucked up.

2. Okay, then while guns may not be the only effective tool for killing, however melee weapons (such as knives) and bombs require skill and knowledge on how to use them (or how to make them if they're bombs) and plus are more preventable.
     It doesn't take 7 years of training to know how to use a crossbow, and plus it doesn't take much to learn where to hit your target either. You're acting as if guns are the only projectile weapons when really, they're not. There are plenty of other ranged weapons that can be effective in killing people. "

"1719","No apologies needed.  It is an insightful and nuanced look as to the real root of the problem.  While there are those within every society that would like nothing more than commit the heinous acts depicted above, the vast majority of homicides are taken out for a motive.  That motive can usually be tied back to the persons personal life, cultural indoctrinations, or poverty/drug related. 

This manner of thinking aims at addressing the issue at hand here that is common in every country.  The US (contrary to popular belief) is not the nation that hold the worst murder rate.  Far from it actually.  Its not even in the top 100.  Farther up that list are plenty of nations with far stricter laws regarding guns and that frankly hasn't done a thing because they have yet to address issues in their respective nations such as drug trade, human trafficking, poverty, and mental health treatment. 

Its less politically ""sexy"" for lack of a better term to try to address these issues than it is to slap a new gun law into place and act like you are the countries savior when in reality all the root causes are still there.  People still are starving and mugging others to get by, people are still dealing drugs and fighting with competing dealers over territory, and people are still being radically under treated for their various mental health ailments.  Getting to the root cause may not always be the easiest or the most electable position, but people need to stop acting like the world is some crude simple place where you can throw a band-aid on like not allowing any more guns and all evil will disappear.  Its willful ignorance at its best. "

You can believe that alcohol restriction enforcement is possible but no one is looking to go down that road again.  No one will vote in a law that already passed and failed miserably and no one wants to allocate funds to yet another government agency that will consistently and systematically violate privacy and the fourth amendment to catch otherwise law abiding citizens. 

In your third paragraph you again assume banning actually affects use which i would implore you to reconsider.  There is no evidence, throughout history to substantiate that a ban on any substance that there is a lucrative market for working.  None.  It would just make the act of trafficking alcohol or the banned substance a lucrative business venture for those that wish to undertake it. 

There are whole hosts of issues with your proposals.  First, if you are required to hand over your keys, people will simply lie and say that they have no keys on them.  Or, they will not bring their keys into the bar.  People don't like to be controlled and there are many ways around this.  Unless you bring a lie detector into the bar too, people will lie and get away with it as usual.  If the legal limit is 0 it accounts for no false positives, or other substances with alcohol that can cause a small blip like mouth wash.  Those have to be taken into account or you are going to get a lot of wrongful convictions.  There has to be a limit and it cannot be 0."
"1725","+Colin Pitts The only people that should have access to the firearm registration list are the ATF, FBI, CIA and local/state police forces. If the job or branch of the government doesn't work with guns, or require that info in an emergency, they don't get it. End of story. And insurance company shouldn't have access to that info and doesn't need it anyway.

The reason alcohol restriction failed was because people can get away with it. The same reason why minor crimes are so common today. If you have a special government branch tasked with tracking down alcohol makers/smuggles (and they actually try) and fierce punishments for breaking alcohol laws (20+ years hard labour) you should be able to curb alcohol use effectively.

I am all for responsible alcohol use and the occasional drink (I drink wine myself) but the problem is even a small amount can cloud your judgement (and you don't need to leave your house to hurt someone) and most people don't drink responsibly. If a kid is misusing something you take it away from them until they learn otherwise. The same needs to be done here. If there was a sure fire way to make sure no one became drunk, had their judgement impaired or used alcohol irresponsibly, then I would have no problem with it. But most people don't, and the amount of people being hurt is too much to overlook. Until we can effectively stop binge drinking, people becoming drunk and using alcohol irresponsibly we need to ban it. And harsher punishments wouldn't work here as a lot of alcohol use wouldn't get picked up, and its always too late if someone gets hurt.

The only way I can think of to potentially reduce alcohol misuse in society is to limit drinks in bars and clubs to x amount. You should have to hand over your keys when you buy an alcoholic beverage, and the legal limit should be 0. That opens up the problem of impaired people on the streets and open to rape, kidnapping, assault, robbery so some form of taxi system would need to be implemented to make sure they take a vehicle home. Reward people for tip offs regarding unregistered alcohol makers or sellers and encourage or reward people to tell police about people drinking too much, hurting others or misbehaving while drunk and given lawbreakers stiff punishments. But even that plan is full of holes. Its easier to just ban it entirely and save people."
"1726","+NathanEpic0123 In regard to alcohol.  Restriction of such has already proven to be a huge failure.  Furthermore, while I can agree that little good comes from binge drinking or things of that nature, you and I are in no position to tell free men and women what to do in their free time.  If having a whisky after a long day makes them happy, then all the power to them.  If they have that whisky and then get in a car, that is a different matter and deserves to be dealt with in court. But here in the United States, you are innocent until proven guilty.  So if i choose to drink I am not guilty of all the crimes and wrong doing that you speak of until proven so in a court of law.  The same as I'm not responsible for the actions of those that misuse firearms. "
"1727","+NathanEpic0123 How about enforcement of existing laws? For example, many firearms offenses currently are discounted in court and plea bargained out in order to catch bigger fish.  It isn't a legislation problem, it should be an enforcement problem. Furthermore, the idea of registration doesnt sit well with many (including myself) due to several privacy issues.  

First obvious one being, if it were well documented who owned a firearm, it could be used to create a de facto gun ban. Now before you jump all over me I'm not insinuating some black helicopter fiasco.  Far from it.  Consider this, if it were public record that you owned or carried firearms, is it ridiculous to assume that insurance companies for instance could refuse you service? It isn't that far fetched, now you can be denied coverage over a whole host of things.  So should a gun registry become common place, the government could pressure insurance companies through government grants to refuse service or reduced service to those that practiced their right to keep and bear arms.  Any father or mother that wanted to have decent life insurance would be compelled to get rid of their firearms in order to protect the interests of their children should the worst happen.  

Just like that you get a very real ""slippery slope"".  While the right to bear arms is still there ""technically""  it is heavily restricted and almost out of existence because of the common knowledge of your owning firearms.  Businesses can write into contracts that they don't hire firearms owners, reduced life insurance, refusal to legal council by certain private practices, ect.  For these reasons people want their ownership of firearms to remain private. "
"1728","+Colin Pitts No. I believe in guns because they serve a purpose. Every gun should be registered along with their owner, licenses should be required to own one and training required for concealed and open carry holders. But there is nothing wrong with guns. They just need tighter control and harsher punishments for misuse (like cars). Alcohol and drugs on the other hand serve no purpose other than to impair your judgement and thought processes which doesn't do any good. I believe I speak for most of the world when I say nothing good has come from either of these. And far more people are hurt (albeit less severely) from drugs and alcohol than guns. I'm fine with alcohol being use as a fuel, disinfectant and other practical uses, same as drugs. But when it has 0 point or purpose, and only hurts people, I don't care for it."

Once more, you claim to be going about this from some unbiased scientific position here, then go on to say a bigoted statement about Americans somehow being genetically different that everyone else in this world by not being able to distinguish reality.  Referring to racism is a very very poor argument.  Genetic superiority claims have been scoffed since Hitler.

Your claims again, are taking a narrow sighted view of the rest of the world and applying nations with other plausible reasons that there are less shooting.  The real correlative data surrounding the shooting deaths is poverty.  Mass shootings, even in the US, is a once in a blue moon occurrence.  You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than you do to be in a mass shooting scenario yet you want to legislate and devote trillions to gun control?  What a monuments waste of money.  More people die each year from drowning in their bathtubs than in ""mass shootings"".  

The problem surrounding the ""mass shootings"" in the US is the education and mental health identification system.  Too often children with special needs are placed in ordinary public schools when they should be receiving specialized care.  Look to a solution not a utopia that doesnt exist.  Look to the numbers.  If you took out LA, Chicago, Detroit, and NYC the US would have a murder rate the same as all your ""western nations"" that you bring up.  The murder difference is coming from impoverished inner city areas that resort to gang violence, not mass shootings, and certainly not the common gun owner. "
"1730","+Colin Pitts Actually, US has the loosest gun control and almost all the mass-shootings. More guns=more gun-deaths. That is scientifically proven. More guns does not prevent mass shootings. 
http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/pdfs/Lemieuxijcjs2014vol9issue1.pdf
page 17. 
US people can't distinguish perception from reality. US has 10-15 times higher gun-deaths than any other western country. Almost all the mass-shootings are on US soil. If you can't handle guns, you don't deserve to redistribute them freely to everyone. The problem is really in the US culture/gun regulation. "
"1731","The same tired argument regarding prohibition.  Ban alcohol and that should stop drunkenness and disorderly conduct right?  Ban drugs and drug use and that should stop all drug use and save the children right?  Ban guns and that should stop all the shootings and crime right?  If you aren't willing to learn from the past you are bound to repeat it. "

"1738","+DJ Nightmayor Well any citizen can walk into a home depot and purchase a circular saw so that is a poor example.  Legally we are talking about guilt versus prevention of liberties.  Yes there is a limit on the blood alcohol level, actually its .08%, but the difference here is the law is enumerating what is and what is not okay to do with the privilege to drink.  We already have that with firearms.  The law states that it is not okay to kill with a gun, it is not okay to carry a gun into places like schools, it is not okay to discharge your gun in a residential area ect.  The difference here is that the law is not preventative.

To use another example, one commonly used to ""prove"" the limits of the first amendment, one cannot stand up and scream 'fire' in a crowded theater.  This argument is factually inaccurate.  You CAN scream fire but you will be prosecuted for it afterwards.  If you were to do the same with free speech in movie theaters as you propose for the second amendment, every patron would have their mouths tapped shut before entering the theater to prevent them from ever having the ability to scream fire.

Ahhhhh now here is the interesting piece of evidence you bring up.  More mass shootings in 3 years.  What constitutes a mass shooting to the media that is reporting on this?  It was reported that there were over 70 school shootings since sandy hook yet upon further inspection it was found that the numbers were skewed to include students involved in shootings , outside school grounds, suicides, and single shot negligent discharges.  Mass shootings?  Hardly.  Under that definition your hostage situation in Sydney was a mass shooting.  "
"1739","You're right, i guess guns can be used by qualified professionals for things other than killing, the same way a circular saw is used by a qualified construction worker.  However, i still don't think ordinary people should be equipped with tools that at their base were designed to kill. Im glad you brought up drink driving. You're right, its morally irrelevant that other people drink and drive and i don't. But legally? no. That's why having even a blood alcohol level of 0.05% (i could be wrong im not expert) is illegal. Why? its hardly fair to say that someone with that sort of alcohol level is too inebriated to drive! But we as a society, (as annoying as it is sometimes) have to set rules that everyone has to follow. By the same logic, there may be many people out there who use guns in the 'right way'. However, as a society, we are only as strong as our weakest link, and if that link happens to be MORE MASS SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE ENTIRE NATION IN THE LAST 3 YEARS THAN THERE HAS EVER BEEN IN 3 YEARS,  then something needs to be done. 86 people die in your country every day due to gun violence. I live in australia. In 1996, we had the port arthur massacre, during which 35 people died. As a result, the government banned guns. Since, we have had no massacres to speak of, apart from maybe the recent tragedy involving the deaths of two hostages during the martin place siege."

"1745","""trying to be the hero of the day making a situation that much more"" Can you site an incident where that has happened?  Gabby Giffords was the closest to that and the guy with the guns didn't go crazy shooting into the crowd.

We know one thing for sure, no other US mass shooting was stopped with a concealed carry person.  Funny how is places where gun are carried this never happens.

Take the Aurora Movie Theater shooter.  There were 7 movie theaters within a 20 minute drive of his home and they were all packed for the midnight Batman Movie premier.  He didn’t go to the largest and he didn’t go to the closest.  He did choose go to the only one posted with a “No-Guns-Allowed” sign on the door.  Colorado is a Concealed Carry friendly state.  He knew the other 6 Movie Theaters probably had armed citizens."

Honestly look at the worlds statistics, countrys that dont allow guns have very little incidents, while america is right at the top for gun related deaths and injuries, but i guess your rational fear that your leader will turn into a dictator and kill you simply cause he was able to take your gun away is much more important.

Except now we have an expensive, unenforceable, essentially useless piece of legislation on the books that took taxpayer dollars to write, present, and ultimately pass for very little change at all.

Nations with similarly high firearms ownership like Switzerland have homicide rates lower than that of the many nation that you constantly bring up.  Ther is no correlation and no causation simple as that."

Why can't you admit that gun laws in America need to be changed. instead you continue saying ""oh well what about the terrorist attack in Europe"" yes I acknowledge that... another point is the isis here in Europe is still a threat, we can not rule that out. they are terrorists, they aren't just some dude that randomly shows up at a elementary school & decides to shoot everybody up.. like it occurs in America, then when his caught you all start saying he was just troubled, didn't have a good childhood blah blah, The United States is currently the most armed nation in the world. plus there are too many stories every year when a child finds a gun sitting around gets hurt because the gun owner didn't properly store their firearm.

"1785","+Rony Theronin yea & what happen to that kwik mart clerk? That's right he got gunned down by one of his ppl. Gandhi was an asshole, he stunk & his breath reek."
"1786","+Rony Theronin  Where is your data to support that assertion?  Frankly it is an oxymoron to say that law abiding people are committing crime because in the act of committing a crime they are no longer law abiding.  Its a circular argument.  It would be like asserting that virgins are the ones that are having sex and spreading STI's.  The very act of sex would no longer make them virgins and the fact that they have an STI would make it statistically unlikely that they were virgins to begin with.  And we find the same with criminals.  Look up any statistics that you would like to, in the US recidivism is rampant.  There are multiple studies that have all come to the conclusion that a vast majority of the incarcerated people in the US had an extensive rap sheet and most of them will be back in prison at some point in their lives.  The most violent offenders are statistically not law abiding people but those with an extensive violent history that built up to murder and assault.

You see, you defeat yourself in bringing up the repealing of the 18th amendment.  The prohibition of alcohol was repealed because it was found to be unenforceable legislation that only affected those Americans that were not alcohol abusers.  The same is true for gun legislation.  If firearms were outlawed tomorrow, what would happen?  There are literally millions in the US and no registry to find them and confiscate them so in order to be effective, the 4th amendment rights to unreasonable searches and seizures would have to be violated as well to search each and every home.  So obviously you see that this is not a practical solution.  BUT you are all for a gun registry.  Which, once more, requires the consent of the individual to be effective.  The simple range going American, the father that goes hunting with his son, the person that honestly doesn't have anything to hide will apply for a registry and in doing so will violate their rights to privacy and enter into a host of inefficient, costly data tapping which is ineffective at catching the real issue.  The parolee, that is already not allowed to have a firearm isn't going to sign a registry.  A two time convicted felon is not going to sign a registry.  An individual that deals drugs for a living or as a side job is not going to sign a registry.  Look at the numbers, recidivist criminals are by far and away the highest violent acting demographic and these people are not going to be addressed by a registry."
"1787","The average murder is not committed by a mob killer, but by the average law abiding citizen who snaps and kill his wife or by simple accidents like the two year old who killed his mother. A registry serves as statistic of the weapons in circulation and prevention for the police during intervention. Imagine a country where cops are not so scared a trigger happy. In Canada you are criminally responsible if your gun is stolen or sold whitout telling the the state. It is simply illegal to own a gun whitout a serial number, but we both know it is not in the US culture to hand the gun simply to verify. And although i'm not sure what you meant by confiscation, I can assure you one thing, Australia and the UK never were as armed as the US. After the registry, many guns that were illegal were declared, a lot of people were encouraged to give their guns,but it is different than saying that the police was making door to door to take the weapons from people.
The second amendment does not justify itself simply by existing. The 18th amendment was repelled after prohibition was considered unfair and undoable. An amendment by definition is a change from the original text. Many times when we try to justify the right for people to pack tremendous amounts of weapons, it turns into conspiracy thinking. Because you cannot justify in a first world country that people do that for self defense. That is why (I have my conspiracy of my own) the NSA nurish the fantasy of the people fighting the government. Hunters and regular gun owners tend to distance themselves from this mindset, but the coots still live like parasites in the majority of lawful gun owners.﻿"
"1788","+Rony Theronin  The issues surrounding registry are first and foremost confiscation.  Now, whenever confiscation is brought up in the US everyone laughs and tells everyone to go put their tin foil hats back on but the fact of the matter is confiscation occurred in the UK and Australia only after a registry was formed.  In addition, when dealing with the 2nd amendment being a part of the bill of rights it is in effect a personal liberty.  Image the uproar if you needed to be a registered author in order to write or speak your opinions to exercise your first amendment rights, that would be ridiculous.  Lastly, a registration only takes into account those that originally purchase the firearm and assumes that the gun in question was obtained legally.  Criminals have been using metal files for years to eliminate serial numbers on firearms, using straw purchases, or illegally smuggling guns into countries around the globe and registries would do nothing to combat this. A registry is only effective after a crime is committed making it a bad crime prevention tool, and also requires that the murder weapon be found which already is the easiest way to convict perpetrators.  If forensic evidence, gun shot residue, finger prints, and a bevy of other evidence on the suspect and murder weapon isnt enough to convict someone, a paper trail to the original purchaser of the firearm isnt really going to tip the scales.  No one is going to be convicted based off of a purchase if there is no other physical evidence to tie them to the murder weapon."

Thats a silly question given we are discussing shooting IN the US and we are discussing changing US legislation.  You are simply ignorant to how reality works and act and speak with emotion rather than knowledge.  You say ""fix"" like you can snap your fingers like a genie and it will  be done.  There are more guns in the US (estimated) than there are people.  How are you going to get them back? Full blown war?  Knocking down every door in america violating not only the 2nd amendment, but the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment, the 3rd amendment, the 14th amendment and so on.  Im all for revisions for the mental health and identifying these shooters before they become a problem, the issue is once more how to do so and since you know how to fix everything I'm sure you have all the answers here on youtube don't you?

You make causation mistakes like a 5 year old or a superstitious old woman.  Correlation does not imply causation.  There are places in the world with far greater gun control than the US and have double the murder rate.  Brazil, Argentina, Russia to name a few.  If you say ""those aren't first world western countries"" than you are admitting that there isn't a gun problem in play.  Its not gun control that all the western nations have in common, its WEALTH.  So we should be focusing on inner city poverty instead where all these murders are taking place rather than a coincidental occurrence like gun laws. 

You most certainly cannot buy a gun in a supermarket in Texas.  Once more, just lazy ignorance.  You need to be Federal Firearms Licensed dealer to sell firearms and ammunition.  If you don't have an FFL dealer, than you can't sell firearms legally it is simple as that, and if they are selling them anyways, than you have proved our point once again that laws don't stop lawless action. "

"1797","That's fucked up."
"1798","+TheSelfishAltruist Once more, easily debatable.  Much like the US, Australia had a rough self reliance attitude for much of their early period as a british colony and as an independent nation.  There is plenty of wildlife in Australia which fostered a thriving hunting culture.  Sane people abhor killing period.  Insane or desperate people could care less how brutal it is or how dirty it is.  People that undertake such murderous actions as those shown above are not in the right state of mind.  They are murdering psychopaths that already have broken dozens of laws so why is adding one more to the laundry list of broken laws going to do anything to stop them?"
"1799","+TheSelfishAltruist Ahh but as I have said numerous times, that thinking is very surface level data analysis.  Some of the most commonly cited nations that have lower crime rates to the US and gun control are nations like Great Britain and Australia.  However in both of these cases, upon further review, it doesnt take long to realize that the murder and crime rates BEFORE gun control legislation are on par with what they currently boast.  So there has been this amazing media spin that has created this notion that these nations were some sort of killing ground before they ""did something"" about firearms.  When in fact, these nations never held the kind of violence that one associates with the high crime areas of the US or with nations in turmoil like Brazil or mexico.  These nations never had issues with high crime or high murder rates even when firearms were more accessible so pointing to that legislation as the sole cause to the comparatively low crime and murder rates in disingenuous at best. "
