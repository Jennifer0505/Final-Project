"1","In porter we beat prospect"
"2","In my school,when we do this every one is still talking when there hiding"
"3","my school each classroom has a shelf and u move the shelf and its a little room"
"4","I wanna work at this place"
"5","in my school we have lockdowns but my second grade teacher told me that when she teached other classes when they head to the corner she tells some of them to go in THE CLOSET  oops capss"
"6","Really? Throwing fucking plastic balls? What a fucking joke"
"7","This isn't realistic at all I don't think some random fuck would come off the street and shoot some kids, if you want it to be real make the shooter another kid"
"8","in Lock downs at my school where not allowed to talk"
"9","what if they had backup or if they had a knife"
"10","If u huddle behind the teachers desk it makes it like 500 times easier for the shooter because instead of 25-30 kids scuttling around the room like ants he/she has them all packed like sardines behind the desk. And if u put it in a lockdown, what if the shooter wanders in an empty classroom or something? Then u could all escape. And if u try to unarmed the shooter he/she would just be like "" bitch don't touch ma gun "" and shoot you to your doom. And probably if u tried to restle a shooter he/she would probably weigh a lot and crush you. And instead of texting ur mom try texting the police because I don't think your parents have an Ak-47 in their closet just in case a mass shooting happens in your school. To all the principals, head teachers and staff, please try to make more efficient drills like escaping the school in the secret exit you should build, then have a wireless button that puts the school in lockdown as soon as the shooter goes in. And all he would have to survive on is the carrots and "" mash potatoes"" they give out. And maybe make sure you don't have many flammables in school grounds just in case the shooter is a crafty one and blows up the school in hope of a person still being inside. And what about closing the doors after about 2nd period? Then open them as the children are leaving school? Or set up cameras outside the school so that you could be more sure of a shooter approaching the grounds? I'm just trying to be logical here. Even hiring a few guards around the school so if a shooter approaches at least you have a few men trying to kill him/her, instead of students having a mental breakdown and inside their head repeating the same message "" we're all gonna die "" "" we're all gonna die "". Even a few German Shepherds could be useful cause they are easily trained and could be very useful in an attack. 

You can thank me later"
"11","Cool, now, can we do something on bomb threats? Because my sister who is 4 years old and in kindergarten had a bomb threat and nothing has happened. I'm in 7th grade and I broke down crying and ran to her school and took her home. And also, no parents were alerted, they only knew if they saw it on their phones. Yeah."
"12","I go to a private school and im in elementary instead of lockers we have cubbys(The teacher locks the door we hide at the cubbys and get down so no one can see us through the window)"
"13","""Covering students in fake blood to make it more realistic""

""Five minutes is the longest lock down we've ever had""

Lol."
"14","Sure! That will surely help if students hind behind a desk/closet and active shooter comes in and shoots them all at once. It is much harder to shoot people if they are separately located, but not together."
"15","everytime there is a lock down my class goes near the computer area away form the window and I like to cover myself with chair to stay safer"
"16","At my school there was never lock down only earth quacks and fires"
"17","At school our teacher said to attack dem badguys if dey r too close to us"
"18","I had a real lock down before"
"19","It's best to be prepared for when jt happens than to not be prepared I have 0 drills for this at all only fire drills so it sucks but it's best to be on alert and make sure to notice when someone's acting up."
"20","when you kneel down and hide in that way it doesn't set the shooter in alarm, or panic kinda like when a predator stalks it's prey it's best if you sit still and cooperate until the cops come. Not every shooter comes and immediately shoots the masses....if that makes any sense. Also I like the idea of teaching the teachers to be able to fight off the shooters I think a good idea would be to grab something and hit the shooter and have 2 strong people to hold them down (preferably cops). And whilst doing that search the person down in case they have any other types of weapons after that have back up and make sure the rest of tje building is clear of other ppl since shooters can often be in groups. After that evacuate the building."

"22","America is literally the only ""modern"" country where this is necessary, just because the government won't accept that gun control IS important. in my state for example all we need is have practice for an accidental fire emergency and even that's uncommon."
"23","I'm scared😩"
"24","And every on poos their pants"
"25","Once my friend heard about the clowns ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY and thought it was right by our school and was yelling ""OMG it's a clown here we need to lockdown and hide! I don't want to die! I hate clowns! Help!"""
"26","We dont have these drills in england...only fire drills"
"27","I feel like I wouldn't want to wear a ""Columbine rocks"" sweatshirt in the state of the massacre happend"
"28","Seeing Holly and him actually fighting was no offense but it was really funny."
"29","back in my day we had fire drills but no fire"
"30","My class is noisy af. If it was a real one they better shut up. Students should also have weapons if the shooter does come in the room, like a chair"
"31","the with the standard prosier is if the shooter is from the school"
"32","What if: the one thats going to kill others, starts When the drill is on going! They would all think its part of the drill"
"33","1:12 Rachel Ray changed her first name and gained 200 pounds"
"34","Schools should have a self defense program or classes instead of those stupid intruder drill. That would make learning more fun."
"35","2:18 ""yeah this will protect us"""
"36","In my school, they just lock the door, put the curtains down turn the lights off and make us sit against a wall."
"37","Police coming into a middle school with guns and the kids know nothing about it? They're shouting that they're gonna kill people? That's just stupid"
"38","wtf at my school they just wiggle the door nob and tell us to hide wtf is this"
"39","columbine should do the drills because of after what Eric Harris and dylan klebold did"
"40","Ok I've always thought it would be better to get them to run? If you run, you're out. Hiding doesn't mean shit, you have to be an idiot not to know they'll be under the desks or some shit."
"41","We had some school drills in Australia. Instead of saying it on the speaker, all parents and police get notified with emails and phone calls, but us students don't get tolled. the school drills come at random times and go from about 1-2 hours."
"42","So there's someone with a gun lets shove everyone in one corner all together. K"
"43","It is better to make a wall of the children's desk at the door and windows"
"44","as soon as i hear pop pop I'm jumping out the fucking window"
"45","murica
what a stupid idea
ban weapons stupid people"
"46","why the fuck would they just have an unannounced shooting drill, that's such a bad idea."
"47","if there was a school shooter in my school I would kill myself."
"48","Having all the kids in one corner of the room would actually make it easier for the shooter to pick them off easier. My school has a drop, tuck, and cover rule. If the warning goes over the intercom, fake or real, we drop where we are in the classroom, if outside, run the the nearest classroom as fast as possible. Tuck your body in as tight as possible to make yourself smaller, and cover your vitals. The teacher pokes their head outside for a few secs and makes sure there are no students outside. She then locks the door and turns of the lights. The students closest to the windows shut the blinds and then drops. The teacher then goes on the school lockdown browser and makes sure all students in the class are accounted for. If she has a few extra students from outside she notifies the teacher that they are with her. We then stay silent and in lockdown until we are released from our principal or other authority figure, and they have to use the correct code to secretly tell us we're safe, if not we will remain in lockdown."
"49","I hope that school fixes there drill system. I live in Massachusetts and after sandy hook we changed our drill to something called ALICE I forgot what it stands for but instead of huddling under a desk giving a shooter 30 targets there are updates over the intercoms where the shooter is located through looking at the cameras while a police officer walks around with an airborne and we run to the nearest exit and run down the road because there is a boys and girls club one way another elementary school another way and town hall another way. And our teachers are trained like in here. Also if there was a real shooter we are allowed to throw whatever at them if he comes in the room. But I do agree with the video saying that this could be scary for some kids but we only have a police officer come in when drilling the high school and elementary school"
"50","I hope the next president makes it illegal to buy guns without a licence. And the reason I said 'next' is because Donald trump doesn't give a fuck. I don't understand why you can buy guns, people say it's to 'protect yourself.' But why would you need protecting if nobody has one? Like if you agree."
"51","My class keeps this old tv with all the inside parts taken out so if there's a school shooter, we can throw the tv at them."
"52","* Shooter walks into school and everyone is hiding in their classrooms

Oh well obviously nobody's here so I'll just go home!"
"53","BigEvilToast they just made it because one time they shot a whole classroom"
"54","Pinkamena Diane Pie I WANT ONE"
"55","Anton Zikarsky banning weapons won't stop criminals from getting them, most shooters get them illegally"
"56","I guess to make the drill seem more realistic with the students being scared for their life and thinking it's an actual shooting and so they could take it seriously."
"57","It was my idea and the school actually accepted it"
"58","Jelly Penguin at our school the classes in the basement gives us scissors in case we aren't fast enough to jump out the windows"
"59","I live in Britain and we have Bullet proof windows. My school doesn't have many corridors and it's mostly outside so we just put our phone on the desks (to make sure that no one is contacting us), lock the doors and hide under the desks."
"60","rip"
"61","You don't scare kids. You prepare them, dammit!  I mean, yeah, scare training sometimes is necessary, but all you've got now is the social girls in tears, the meme-obsessed guys with piss-stained pants, and then the social media group all huddling together, with both tears and wet pants. Good job, Florida!
👍😀👍"
"62","once uh i think 3rd grade? they were on lock down and we heard a gunshot im like DA FUQ GOING ON? but we knew it was a drill since we heard people talking outside  xD"
"63","Here's a story I'm in 6 grade seriously on Friday last week we had a lockdown drill we failed all we did was crawl on the floor and talked and screamed"
"64","if an actual school shooter comes to my school he's going to fucking die."
"65","The end was funny 😂"
"66","If it would not be a drill i would grab my pocket knife charge to the side of the door and if the villan come in IMA STAB IT UNTIL IT'S DEAD >=D"
"67","We did an active shooter drill at my school and when we were hiding, everyone was laughing and pulling out their phones"
"68","I would be like, Lets get this Sh^t Going!"
"69","she made the biggest mistake by grabbing the gun"
"70","May the kids and teachers that lost their lives in the columbine shooting rest in piece"
"71","I can see a serious flaw with these lockdown drills. I always have, even since 5th grade. What if the shooter KNOWS that they've gone on lockdown, and they KNOW how the lockdown drill works because they had it when they were a kid? Then they'd know everyone is still in their rooms, and they'd know they were huddled in a corner."
"72","I disagree with this because they might get used to the drill and if a real shooting happened they won't think it's real"
"73","Are drills are boring"
"74","Looks like msheartattack that teacher"
"75","If a shooter came into the school and he tries to harm u you just kick him In the nuts or the stomach!  The. That will save you,hopefully!☺️"
"76","We have lock downs drills but not the school shooting ones."
"77","Eric, Dylan... I'm so glad you fucks are dead, pussyshits."
"78","ummm, in my school we don't have these and we live in one of the most dangerous places..."
"79","Every time in my school when we have a drill every kid except me just laughs and giggles and I think they don't care if they die in a drill and I hope my best friend does not think to do any of that."
"80","It would be so ironic if it happened a school shooting during a drill"
"81","my drills just have someone to check if the doors are locked. lol"
"82","What happens if you stand up and yell ""nice meme"" during the drill?"
"83","5:55 but whilst they're on the floor he would probably shoot her on the leg"
"84","3:48 this looks really fun. Not if it actually happened but as a drill. Not being disrespectful just I would love to miss lessons for this"
"85","First you jokers need some to do something with bullies in school, but you teach em how to stay behind table and lock doors?:DDDD OMG one shoot in doors and this is open... And you all die... :DD All bullies die!!! ERIC AND DYLAN BEST !!!"
"86","okay guys! be fucking real! if you came face to face with a shooter in the hallways of your school you would freeze the fuck up! stop acting like a tough bitch and come to the reality of things! if you were smart you would know that a shooter could fucking shoot you whether you ran or attacked!"
"87","my class stands in the flipping hallway. oh shooters here and we cant hide anywhere now!!😡"
"88","Honestly if you're smart then board up the fucking door"
"89","the funniest thing is that america could solve this whole problem by just getting rid of their loose ass gun laws like damn you don't fucking NEED them."
"90","why don't schools do bully test like this tbh there are more school bullies than school shooters"
"91","One time I was in a lockdown and me and my friends were laughing it was hilarious my teacher sent us back to our seat I said if I die he/she is most likely to kill everyone too so she told me to comeback after"
"92","I'm so glad these teachers are learning actual defense techniques rather than just sitting in the dark waiting to be shot."
"93","I would be like fuck you i dont give a shit im not scared xD "
"94","..Why don't they just ban guns already.."
"95","Why don't schools just lock all the entry doors?"
"96","My school warns us about the drill and just explains the basic like: where to hide,and what to do if you are outside of the classroom."
"97","So I live in a country where school shootings are very rare. Do Americans find this disturbing or do you think this is a good idea?"
"98","A killer is gónna shoot what he sees he isnt gónna look for u he would have to think fast don't u guys agree?"
"99","We had a bomb threat at my old school, and we had to sit under a table for around three to four hours long. Me and my friends were literally crying"
"100","in germany it's illegal to have shooter trainings"
"101","Whenever i hear about a school shooting in america, i never feel bad. Sell guns= death"
"102","she could of got shot in the leg"
"103","Alternatively : ban guns but hey probably shouldn't say that don't wanna get shot"
"104","my school dosent have lockdown drills even though we have a police officer always in the school to keep us safe"
"105","smh, fucking Americans, lmfaooo"
"106","I used to live in a town neighboring Newtown. On the day of the shooting, I was in art class when word got to the school. We went into lockdown and no one knew what to do."
"107","1:16 his face"
"108","that's scary"
"109","Love how everyone in comments are acting like some Ninjas or wizards or something."
"110","I think it's a good drill"
"111","There was a fire drill and it turned out there was a tiny tiny fire and then people actually thought it was fake because at first it was so we went outside thinking it was fake and then the people who were leaving doors open and the main thing a fire needs is oxygen so we were already pretty much dead and then because they had organaised a drill they sent us back inside and there was a mini fire in the hall that had at that point turned into a full blown fire and then we were all getting on with the work we were meant to do and then we were outside again and this time we weren't faking and some people going to the kitchen for our daily tuc shop almost died in this whole thing"
"112","I don't do ANY type of drill at my school, apart from Fire Drills."
"113","What if Bruce lee was in that school?And he was a teacher?"
"114","Truth is, one person should at least stand at the door with a weapon in case an intruder broke in. This makes schools even safer. As my theory states, if school students and teachers know how to defend against intruders, you can save many lives as if you are in a position you can not undo quickly and someone is shooting, y o u r  d e a d . 

schools, for students safety, please teach how to defend against common dangers."
"115","i would have shit myself"
"116","My history teacher told us that they now have a 2 by 4 to barricade their doors with and some students (if it comes to it) have scissors in their pencil bags."
"117","Our school has a ""green time table"" ( an evacuation plan so the killer doesn't know what's happening ) but the thing is we have a lot of really stupid kids in our class so while the principle was yelling down the hall a kid in my class got scared and farted but they did it during our Japanese class and our Japanese teacher has a pretty funny accent cause we're Australian so when he yelled at the kid everyone laughed and the principle tried to break down the school. Our green timetable never works"
"118","Whaat? This is insane! How is this going to help anything? You have no control with no weapons against someone else who has one."
"119","is it just me or was there only boys in that class"
"120","When we have drills we noisey af

(we were all on the floor in the dark and the drill lasted 15 minutes)

like seriously there's some guy eating chips under his desk, some guy sketching, others doing gossip, some were making paper boats. etc"
"121","I was taking this seriously i till you said sandy hook that always makes me cryb"
"122","'Murica!"
"123","How about we teach kids how to recognize if a student is mentally ill and going to hurt someone and help people get the help they need?"
"124","how do you stop a school shooting? Make everyone emo so everyone gets along"
"125","o"
"126","Normalizing school shootings, makes it normal."
"127","In high school, we had a drug dealer enter my school and had it locked down for half an hour. The principal escorted the dealer out. A few idiots decided to start yelling ""I'M IN HERE!"""
"128","One time I had one of these and it was a drill. It lasted about an hour or 2."
"129","They do realize that the potential school shooters are the ones they're teaching too, right?"
"130","My classmates scream and laugh in drills"
"131","going to hide in a corner is a horrible idea you'll just be shot into swiss cheese if they get in"
"132","Schools should have one class where you can learn about shoutings and stuff about fire arms and how to defend yourself not huddle up in a corner and hope nothing goes wrong hey I agree don't play hero but at least so people can know what's happening so they are not completely totally clueless about what's happening"
"133","I live in England so this don't happen, thank god!"
"134","I'll show this to my principal and he will be impressed"
"135","3:52 they whooped his ass LOL"
"136","why not ban guns in america"
"137","lol if everyone is told to keep quiet why the interviewer talking to the kids?"
"138","my advisory teacher gave the kids in my class instructions on what to do if this kid if thing happens, and basically what we woukd do is stack the desks against the door, brake the windows, get out, and run"
"139","rule 1 don't group up in a corner"
"140","My friend went to jewett"
"141","This is how a drill should be."
"142","Run. Hide. Fight. 

Its fucked up but so necessary nowadays."
"143","I wish my school did this."
"144","that's a tec 9 right there brotha"
"145","Holy shit, if it was my school my class would be the first to get shot up because they are so loud"
"146","Teachers should just be trained to carry guns. That way if there is a school shooter the teacher can fire immediately before anyone gets hert"
"147","I had a real lockdown once, um, my school was super close to a police station, about 4 minutes, and then someone kinda...got away, I guess, and we got locked down, it was weird cause it was the last day of school and we were mid party, and it was scary-ish, but then we sat there for an hour, and ended up playing assassin and go fish...so ya...."
"148","I love how Kinder eggs aren't legal but guns are."
"149","In England we're told to tuck our head between our legs and kiss our asses goodbye. Or fuck up the pussy who's shooting us, either way works."
"150","DAMN THAT ONE TEACHER SAVAGE"
"151","Guns should just be banned"
"152","In that scene at 2 minutes 20. She locks the door yet they fail to do one key thing. In the event of a shooting - If your building as doors with arms (like at the time i stated) you should rap a belt round it, the door will be so secure, no human could force it open. You should also break glass or spill water in front of the door, if the armed man falls, jump and restrain. Hope that was educational and saves lives. Probably wont but hey, its worth a shot :P"
"153","good news is that the elevator at my school is not working anymore and ALL the stairs r off limites during class"
"154","only in fucking america. get a grip."
"155","I think a better school system would protect the children. Most kids do shootings, because they have been treated unfair. Most school systems are unfair!!!"
"156","Because a desk is gonna save you from and ak"
"157","Rid your stupid bloody gun laws and these drills may not have to happen"
"158","My school's drill is a little different. We were told to be quiet and listen for footsteps. Our Principle had an ultra guarded door protecting her room. The principle spoke on the intercom so that only the inside of the classroom heard it. She told us where the shooter was. The teacher would decide if it was safe to leave and escape. We had to get outside where police are standing and evacuate as many people as possible. If some one entered the classroom, you could throw ANYTHING at them. If necessary you could pick up the nearest desk and throw it at their head so long as it would keep people safe. This was in 5th grade."
"159","Draco And Hermione. DONT TURN IT OFF SHUT IT DOWN LIKE HOLD DOWN THE POWER BUTTON AND POWER IT OFD"
"160","Gamer Girl Well it's rainy and cold but generally it's a really nice place. No tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes and London is really good for tourists"
"161","Me and my family want to go to Britain so what is it like ?"
"162","Vance Stone what's your problem? All they were wondering was why they haven't banned guns, it's not like they were you to die in a hole or anything."
"163","TimePro is the tolilet upstairs lol"
"164","and why did i move here to USA, i should have stayed in germany!"
"165","""only in america"""
"166","For all you dumbass people saying no shit is going to happen because your country has better gun control a fucking police man could just snap and go murder your ass at any school in some countries you get shot by the police just because you sat down and Im not hating Im just stating the FUCKING truth."
"167","""It was just a prank,bro"""
"168","fuck my class has 2 windows imma jump out dat bish"
"169","so one school shooting a month? why do Americans let citizens carry guns again?"
"170","I don't do fire drills...."
"171","putting so much time into this in news is only gonna promote more school shooters. stop showing it in tv even thoguh its a big deael i think its bad"
"172","Why do they huddle in a corner, that just makes it worse"
"173","We don't have drills... well we only have them once every 4 years..I CRY! D:"
"174","school=shooting range"
"175","this should be at least in every school. it shouldn't be so violent but it should happen. it helps the kids realize that it isn't a joke, and when they're talking and acting stupid, they could get hurt and possibly die. it also gives those sadists (me and my friends xD) the adrenalin rush."
"176","I got robbed once and I just punched him in the trougt and ran with my wallet and my phone"
"177","Hiding really isn't going to help, nor will running in the halls. There's really no best way but either to throw full desks and tables at the shooter, or go out a window while the shooters inside."
"178","I'm glad I'm in the uk because all we have is fire drills"
"179","IM GONNA KILL EVERYBODY, NOBODYS GETTIN OUT OF HERE"
"180","If there is one I will kick him in the head until he is dead"
"181","Oh wow. In my school, we should need this training art how to defend ourselves from shooters and terrorists. (Sorry for my bad English.)"
"182","then he kicks in the door and tosses a pipe bomb between those kids all bunched up in a corner"
"183","My school doesn't even do this even though I live I. A place where it has more shooting than New York and California combined"
"184","Sitting in a corner is dumb your just helping the shooter.You might as well try to fight him back and if you die well at least your tried doing something and not just sit there.Than again kids say they would tackle him down but they probably would get scared.
So 3 options
1.try fighting back
2.run away if possible
3.play dead if the shooter starts killing"
"185","my school doesn't teach the staff that stuff"
"186","one time we had a school shooting drill but they didn't tell us and we were all so terrified. the principal or some teacher came around and jiggled and banged on the door."
"187","wooow"
"188","00:01 u expect me to ignore that Spiderman"
"189","My music teacher has a baseball bat in case a shooter comes in, there's a lock on the 2 doors to get in, but it's another precaution"
"190","America... get your shit together!"
"191","That is why im so glad im living in Cananda not Amaraca 😓😓"
"192","Shit no light i think they are not home lets get out of this school no one is here"
"193","One time there was real shooting in my school and they broke down my classroom door and I grabbed my pocket knife and stabbed there neck and they were then pronounced dead at the end of the day"
"194","If I was in a shooting I would jump out the window"
"195","i'm here from leafy"
"196","J"
"197","Depending on where they come from id jump out the window"
"198","My mother used to be a teacher for 30 years. I've 15 years of sporting shooting experience, rifles to pistols & timed speed shooting. I'm so glad she has retired, given what is possible these days, & how ridiculous the drills in this tv show were."
"199","All we know is if you're behind them, with an object, you hit them on the head. Either they'll be knocked out, or dead. 

Mostly knocked out. A heavy book will get the job done."
"200","The problem I have with school shootings is that the media always blames bullying. In most mass school shootings, bullying has nothing too do with it."
"201","The problem I have with school shootings is that the media always blames bullying. In most mass school shootings, bullying has nothing too do with it."
"202","Tbh if schools prepare for these attacks then this might be shooter might not choose that school. Not only will these pretend attacks scare kids but if they learn how to fight who would know if they won't use it for protection but for bulling or other acts."
"203","If a shooter came into my class i wanna hit him with my textbook and yell: YOU JUST GOT HIT WITH KNOWLEDGE!"
"204","in England you don't  have shooting drills"
"205","my school doesnt make us hide. they just close the door, we only have 2 lockdown drills a year and we arent told to do anything but be ready"
"206","I don't understand why they bother ducking... it's not like a shooter is gonna walk in and be like ""oh crap they're ducking nothing I can do"" and walk away"
"207","They won't be loving it when a real shooter comes in"
"208","this is kind of funny because you didn't teach us how to stop the shooters but what is the two or maybe three so going to be that easy to stop them"
"209","What if they trained certain teachers and staff to have guns on them at all times?"
"210","Am I the only one who would gladly be running around in the halls and screaming ""Come get me, fucker!"" if it meant distracting the bastard for a few minutes. If the police respond quickly then I'm fine. Good logic, right?"
"211","That one virginia teacher- ""We shouldn't have to prepare for a real world threat that if inflicted successfully would be a horrific tragedy, because it might freak out the kids for 15 minutes, no, we should just wait for when the time comes and just panic! Sure, in that scenario many more people would die but at least they will have only been spooked once, as opposed to them having a drill and later having a real shooting where they're spooked twice! So yeah.... yeah panic's totally better."" Fucking blithering idiot."
"212","Damn that teacher is strong as hell"
"213","Its not the best way of keeping everyone safe in a school shooting if a shooter comes in the room and he would just see a bunch of kids in a courner"
"214","Fuck this shit thank god I live in Australia"
"215","Ok let's be honest the guy wasn't even trying to get out of that"
"216","I'd pay money to see your audi do 130 mph lady."
"217","it is the thought  that some parent is putting their child's  life in your hands"
"218","dang. this is all so dramatic and terrifying. all we do is sit in a corner with the lights off, door locked, blinds down and the security comes around jingles the door handle and MAYBE bangs on the door. we never have police come in and shoot blanks or have people play dead. how do you even continue school after that, I'd be traumatized."
"219","why are these things on my recommendation list"
"220","yeah of course lets make some drills to train people fighting back instead of getting rid of the weapon rights fucking dumb americans why there is no school shoot up in europe because no one has a gun and when someone has a gun he dont shoots up a school"
"221","my school should have one of this drills."
"222","We don't have a lockdown drill. We don't even have a loud speaker. English schools🙄"
"223","We have a school intruder drill at my school. It's not very safe for the children but it's the best we can do for a school like mine. I'm in eighth grade. So here's how it goes: at some schools, anyone can get it in because the doors are unlocked. Well, after the late bell rings, all the doors are locked. We have security cameras at the north, east, south, and west entrances. Someone is only allowed in if the school secretary presses a button which unlocks the door. This can only take place at the north entrance which is where main office is. The principal and school secretary are permitted to check all the security cameras every ten minutes. Any visitors or parents who come to the north entrance to do something for the school or pick up a child, have to ring the bell. An adult cannot come in if they have not alerted the school that they are coming. 

Now, the doors can be opened from the inside. And we have little kids running a round who can open the doors to anyone. We have had this incident taken place before and it was very frightening. Luckily, the situation was mild. A sixth grader let in a mentally disabled man after the student came downstairs to go to the office. The man walked into classrooms, stuck his head into doors, and walked down the halls. It was very scary for the students. Right away, someone confronted the man. 

After this incident, precautions and drills were taken to prevent this from happening again, and if the situation were to take place but worse. Thus, the school intruder drill was made. 

Motion sensors were placed at all doors. These motion sensors are very articulate. If someone had alerted the school they coming to pick up a kid or whatever, that time frame would be entered into the motion system so it can watch for this person. If someone comes to the doors and does not have a time frame inserted into the system, the movement is sensed and a picture is taken and sent to the police. 

If the intruder were to continue to the door, the staff would be alerted by PA, ""Programmed Announcement System"", and the principal would speak in a low tone and say a code. The teachers, who obviously know the code, would then alert the students and tell them quietly to begin the Intruder Notice System.

The Intruder Notice System is a system that students must begin after a code is spoken. The teacher immediately locks the door and turns off the lights. Students begin to quietly move around to their positions. Small students, who already know what to do, fit into the lockers in the classrooms. Other students huddle as closely as they can in the corner farthest from the door view. After the teacher checks that the students are in place, the teacher presses a button which notifies the principal that they have hid and secure everything, and then hides under their desk. 

While the INS is taking place, other staff round up the students who are walking about in the halls or in the bathroom and take them to the basement to hide them there.

And while all of this happening, the principal has already contacted 911. The secretary and principal make sure all of the lights are glowing (the lights are in the main office. These lights are the ones that glow after a teacher presses the button I was talking about earlier). Then, they lock the main office door and hide in the principal's office, which is within the main office, and lock that door.

I know it's not that secure, but it's the best we could do."
"224","I don't live in the Us , in the U.K. . Thank fuck guns are illegal here"
"225","This is why they get the idea fucking idiots"
"226","A complete gun ban isn't the answer. It's too impractical in a country the size of the US, plus there are issues of unconstitutionality. Giving everyone a gun isn't the answer either however. The more guns there are the higher the probability that the wrong person gets their hands on it. Think about how it would feel walking down the street on a daily basis knowing that at any moment it might devolve into a shootout with someone else. What we need is tighter restrictions on guns that at least make it harder for the wrong people to get them. If you make it harder to get a gun through legal avenues, it will also drive up prices significantly on the black market for criminals. It's basic supply and demand. Honestly it's common sense, so it's really frustrating to see the extreme polarization on both sides stopping any productive changes from being made."
"227","""Lets all hide in the corner together so he won't shoot all of us"""
"228","Schools should have defence against this, more than just a lockdown. Maybe pepper spray or bb guns, but unacessible to kids"
"229","Honestly if I was a shooter and I saw someone snap chatting this I would stop look at them ask them why are you retarded then smash their phone"
"230","You can no longer hijack an airline post 9/11 because everyone between 8 and 80 will fight you tooth and nail.  The pilots also often have guns.  Maybe we apply the same logic in schools."
"231","A door with no locks on doors is really retarded"
"232","why are they keeping the lights on in the classrooms"
"233","6:08 lmfao bitch is screaming I died."
"234","'Murica!"
"235","Well, one possible solution is install metal detectors and have guards like all the African American schools have."
"236","If the shooter was real when the teacher ""disarmed him"" he could have shot her leg twice and the kids about thirty times...."
"237","my teacher has a steel bat!!"
"238","Good way to traumatize kids :p"
"239","My teacher does TaeKwonDo"
"240","I support this if someone was shooting up my school option one is to run out of the school when there not looking or is to throw the nearest object such as a chair a stapler or these hands"
"241","That's not what we do. We go hide in a closet, and if a shooter comes in, we're told to throw items like shoes and books at them, that way they can't aim at us. You're going to get killed if you just sit there doing noting."
"242","I am happy to see teachers learning how to defend their children from shooters it keeps me at ease that the children will be protected by the people who help them grow and learn. We need more people like this."
"243","I think it's good kids are being prepared like this. And the kids know it's a drill, they aren't going to be that scared, it kind of seems like they're over exaggerating it"
"244","This is good knowledge that everyone should know regardless of being in a school situation. Everyone should be able to defend themselves in a variety of circumstances. This is good life skilsl period. And that Virginia teacher who was complaining, well i'd say to her not everyone in life wants to be a victim. If she wants to that's on her, but she doesn't speak on behalf of me or my family, and we choose to defend ourselves to the best of our abilities and never be a victim."
"245","Screw all that I'd say ""Yo dad, if I die, I want you to know your fat. You don't have guns."""

"251","I do believe that in a life or death situation when it comes to defending yourself that without hesitation you will do anything you can possibly do in order to survive so why not fight back when the school population itself can not be outnumbered. That's just my opinion after all training is the key to prepare for whats unexpected🤔"
"252","Why would you hide in a corner if you have a window you could open?"
"253","Only in America!"

smh!!!"

"274","The safety measures are so stupid the guy can just shoot the lock on the door come in and since all the kids are already in one spot he can shoot them really easily and quickly they should teach the kids to know they're way out that way if he comes in the classroom they can escape and not hide or run, hiding and running is not enough on a real lockdown mabey open a window and teach the kids how to crawl out if it gets to it"

"286","5 mins my school had an half hour"
"287","That was a great analogy it's exactly like the duck and cover drills from the 50's. A 120 pound lady with such minimalistic and a room full of kids with tennis balls has about as much a chance of stopping a shooter as crouching under a desk has of protecting you from a nuclear bomb. I understand the necessity of giving them something to make them feel safe but realistically wouldn't it be better to arm a few teachers to actually give them a chance of neutralizing a situation like this?"

"305","I remember when i was in middle school my mom told me to run if there was a shooter and not wait around. I'm in high school now and it still sounds like the better option, especially if the shooter is far away.

"307","This is real fucking fear mongering. If we are going to be hypersensitive to trauma like this, how will we be ready for real disasters?"
"308","The problem isnt that the drill is ""too rough and mean"" its that the drill they do is useless that instead of rope rappelling out of a window or a stampede run out of the school they sit them in a corner and put the whole school in sitting duck mode."

"314","Xavier TATE you say?"
"315","it's sad how in this generation a drill like this can be considered normal. We shouldn't have to prepare ourselves for shooting if we can try to prevent it. There are signs. You don't just wake up one day and say I'm going to shoot up a school. It takes time. Don't  get me wrong i think this is a great idea, we should be prepared in the case it happens in a school. But it shouldn't be something students are already semi use to."

"324","How about move all the tables to BLOCK THE DAMN DOOR! instead of just going behind the teachers desk and leaving the door just locked.I mean if your a shooter and just see a bunch of closed doors with the blinds they would just shoot the window and unlock the door or even shoot the hinges and bust the door down,but if you block the door with a bunch of tables it will be more of a struggle.my opinion though :/"
"325","Since this school is prepared, I think the shooters will go to another nearby school."

Everybody was so scared and shit but I was like chilled out because I knew the fuck is happening so as the jerk I am I just got out of class and started walking in the hallways while some classmates started walking behind me because they were scared or something that he will shoot me.
And it was the funniest thing ever because this one guy who is in the art community, had red pain all over his shirt and everyone thought it was him."

I knew a woman who lived in Florida named Leslie who was 16 from 2000-2001 and she actually had a drill on March 10 2006 after some crazy kid brought a gun and shot at some jocks locker.  He nearly went ballistic before the police arrived and dragged him off.  He snuck in through the janitors door and according to her just shot in the hallways during class and everyone heard constant gunfire and the teachers and students had a 4 hour lockdown 10 bullets were found in his locker."

"348","wouldn't it be better if while the fucker's down , the children push desks and hit him however they can . chalk . water . chairs . everything . why only the teacher ? huh ? a 4'th grader should be able to throw a chair. or smoke him . sponges full of chalk smoke . a few crucial seconds . and water . all kids have a bottle of water . y'know , we are taught , adults have power , but if we have numbers , screw the power."

"353","my elementary school only ever did 1 lockdown drill. And one time we had a tornado drill, but it was real. that's it. so far my middle school has only done 1 fire drill. I go to public school so they probably couldn't give less of a shit if we were hurt. those teachers would run for their life and leave their students behind"

"358","Only thing I would be worry about is let say the shooter is the kid. That kid would know the plan already. So that wouldn't help much during a shooting to stop him/her."
"359","My school is also in CO but they don't even tell, teachers, admin, students, or parents until it is completely over. It's annoying."

"402","I'm sorry but lockdowns are absolute shit, and I can't imagine any huge positive effect it would have on keeping kids safe. If a shooter was inside the building, how would grouping up in a corner altogether help? You're literally saying ""Yes, please shoot me."" A shooter comes in a classroom, and bam, all of the kids are grouped up together, which makes it so easy to be killed. ""The shooter would think that the classroom is empty if we hide good enough."" Shooters clearly fucking know that people are in the school, and I'd like to bet that they know that they're just hiding. Schools should teach kids ways to evacuate the building, or even how to disarm/defend against the gunman. For my school atleast, we just sit in the corner with the lights off, which is fucking ridiculous to me."
"403","I know the SRO at my school so well he said if there is a shooter and Im near the SRO to grab his gun if he gets shot and take the guy down I'm like hell yeah be hyped on mtn dew in load a clip make him 18 new ass holes"
"404","my school did a real shooting drill and someone died :("
"405","The takedown thing is bullshit. Just grabbing em by the arm and pulling em to the ground isn't enough. They still have 1 more hand. There second hand could grab a knife on his waste. Stab her to death, and than continue and shoot everyone or just punch her out. The best way to disarm is to throw off the guns line of fire to a safe spot than go for the throat. What is the gun controlled by? Your hand. What is your hand controlled by? Arm. What controls your arm? Your torso. Than bloodflow from your throat into your brain. If you punch someone in the throat it's gonna fuck them up more than grabbing there arm and getting your ass beat."

"429","I wanna see one of the teachers in like helmets and gear, same with the ""shooter"" and have them both try as hard as they can. You can hit and whatever. I bet the shooter could easily overcome a teacher."
"430","then there's the school that I go to... we don't even do earthquake drills anymore."
"431","when there is a shooting get books pencils and chairs to hit the guys bit him kick him fucking pretend that he stone your candy 😠😠😠 no one steals my candy!!!
sorry for the bad language"
"432","I would be the one to roast the shooter and my friends in the middle of a school shooting."
"433","Every time we have a practice lockdown our teacher always locks the door in the beginning of the school day and our door is wooden and has a small square glass in the middle that's covered with black paper and when it starts we always close the locked door and turn the lights off and quietly walk to the back of the classroom and we have these bookshelves and round tables in the back and we always tip the round tables over with one of the mini bookshelves with we place it next to the round tables and we grab one chair and put it next to us I guess you could say we're pretty protected but if you always count laughing quietly or someone farting is horrible while the police come to our school and bang on our doors and scream open up but I'm always scared if we had a real one we'd be the first class to die."

"438","I will bite"
"439","a highly intelligent shooter breaks into a school the school gets all ready all the students and the teachers are in their classrooms with all the desks moved towards the door and the little blind thing covering the glass the shooter shoots anyone in the hallway he breaks through the little glass pane on the door and sticks his hand in and unlocks the door at this point everyone is either screaming crying or afraid the shooter climbs over the desks and opens fire in the huge crowd of students all of them are injured or dead the shooter reaches another class room this one has a confident teacher and a bunch of students with plastic balls he breaks the piece of glass and reaches his hand in and then the teacher grabs his hand he quickly pulls the knife off his belt and stabs her she screams and lets go he swings open the door  and a 10 year old boy grabs his leg the boy is shot he attacks some other students he then makes it to the gym he shoots he glass and unlocks the door a teacher tackles him to the ground he stabs the teacher with his knife she gets off him the kids throw throw balls at him which has no effect he then shoots them  i know what you're thinking but what if the school had a sro he would kill  the sro on sight while the sro would probably try to tackle him or say put your hands up or put the gun down not waning to lose his badge or be charged with something and the sro could only shoot  in self defense or if the shooter attacked him the sro couldn't just randomly shoot the  intruder or what if the whole class charged him well most likely since they're all in elementary school they're to afraid if it was a highschool or a college  they would probably attack him in a horde  if maybe 4 or 5 people attacked him they would still die because the fairly strong intruder could kick them in the face or chest or stab them or shoot them and what if he didn't have a knife he would fire his gun at the wall or he floor or wherever the teacher moved it or what if the teacher moved his gun well unlike the intruder in that video this shooter was wise and decided to bring a LMG with him which would be very hard to grab from his hands and throw or slide across the floor the end. also what happens when there is  5-10 shooters they know it could also be a whole gang attack on the school  i'm talking 20-30 people wtf does the school do get 20-30 teachers or football players and all of this training is just based off some none violent shooter if some football player tried to tackle the shooter he would shoot them right square in the stomach or ribs or head or legs  also ever thought about explosves someone could just throw a pipebomb at the school  they need more common sense a shooter will kill you as soon as he sees you not just stand there and wait for you to tackle him and i wish you were strong enough to pickup a chair and have it over you head and knock them out  i'd like to see some school nerd or football player   turn into a triple h or conor mcgregor  like beast  in a matter of seconds"
"440","We dont do lockdown drills."
"441","Oh man I'm so so more than a fire drill!!!😳😞😳😞😳😞😳😞"
"442","I'm glad they do drills. I WISH they didn't have to, but they do because of the way things are now. I'd rather the students and teachers be prepared than not if something happens. And I like how the teachers get the training."
"443","legit my schools drills are just sitting on the floor and the administration knocks on the doors but tbh don't think the shooter will be that polite"
"444","I liked the way one of my teachers taught lockdown.  Fight back.  Would you rather wait for them to come in and kill everyone huddled in a corner, or have a chance, few injured or dead while disarming the intruder."
"445","they dont do this in ma school"
"446","how about letting the schools linebacker go in and fucking rip the gun man's arm off"
"447","My school first announces that we are going to have a lockdown, then we turn of the lights, lock the door, and sit in the corner covering up and with our mouths shut. If one of us have to pee badly, we quietly go to the garbage can. The one where they threw stuff made me laugh just so hard lol. I LUV THIS"
"448","lol the gun thing in schools are very serious 
but in my old elementary school we had like a farewell and we could dress up in a costume and fool around the last time beying there and a few of my school mates were dressed up as terrorists with airsoft guns and no one gave a crap if we had a gun xDD"
"449","hello"
"450","No no you got this all wrong My dads a principal and it's ok to make it realistic but you need to make doors that able to accessible from the inside so you will have a backup plan to leave incase you the shooter is about to come in the school."
"451","You know you're Canadian when you've only had lockdowns because of animals -.- lmao I've been in lockdowns because of foxes, coyotes and once, an escaped prisoner near Toronto. Hmm."
"452","Oh cool"
"453","in a real life situation I'm sure that the teacher would anything to stop the attacker like scraching, biting and things like that to stop that person."
"454","My school does tornado drills fire drills and lockdown drills"
"455","Wow thats pretty freaky atleast we dont have those in ny country..."
"456","my teacher is more scared then 90 percent of the students in my class"

"465","That's a lit teacher"
"466","This is so sad why is this even a thing"
"467","the guy obviously wasn't trying"
"468","If there is a school I will call the cops grap a chair and beat his ass with it"
"469","WTD why would u all hide behind a fucking desk try to escape like the fuck"
"470","OOH OOH OH MY GOD THAT TAKEDOWN"
"471","just dipped my fingers in my juice in stead of my chips"
"472","I think all teachers needs this training not only school but daycare teachers or any. It's a great idea."
"473","We only do fire drills at my school"
"474","this is my school"
"475","It used to be shooters. Now it's clowns."
"476","this would be the perfect mlg moment if some guy jumped at the shooter and knocks him out"
"477","no fair"
"478","I only had lockdown at my school for about 3-5 minutes when usually we have a lockdown for about 10 minutes and we didn't know if it was real or a drill"
"479","0:41 the girl was recording 😭"
"480","Was that an airsoft gun?"
"481","Its stupid how the whole class sits in a corner, while the shooter can just shoot everyone. Why not just be spread out and if a shooter comes in, it takes more time to aim while students and teachers can fight back"
"482","hay in a lock down your phone is spost to be off not texting your mom"
"483","my school just makes us hide"
"484","There"

"487","I had a lockdown in school and someone banged on my door and I freaked out"
"488","My class is so noisy in the practice lock downs, I just hope that it will be totally different if we ever do have a proper one.. 😬"
"489","Whenever we have a lockdown in my class none of the students even care or worry as I'm from Australia where none of these shootings happen. It annoys me most of the kids in my school think it's a joke and so they continue talking, getting up from under the desk and just walking around."
"490","teacher should be the main attraction towards the gun man and then students on the gunman lol (LAWL)"
"491","LIFE LESSON : IF THERE IS GUN SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL AND THERE IN UR CLASS OR WHERE EVER YOU ARE PLAY DEAD AND YOU WILL SURVIVE WHEN HE OR SHE LEAVES. 🙂"
"492","+pogocrazy111 The point of the take down is that it is simple to understand and doesn't require you to need the strength to throat punch someone. If you mess that punch up which is incredibly easier than the take down you are dead. The purpose is also to just neutralize the gun so someone else can come in and subdue other limbs of the shooter's. We aren't training teachers to be judo champions and solo take on shooters it is just a simple method that increases your chance of survival if it happens."
"493","pogocrazy111 You are a very smart person"

"520","Lol that won't do anything"
"521","Same, why don't they teach the upper grades how to fight? (if you're in elementary school)"

"528","Why doesn't the men stay next to door? If they were next to door they could attack shooter with chairs when they came in. Instead they just cower in fear in the opposite corner away from the door without any chance of fighting back?"
"529","Hahaha what stupid fucking administration would allow this? If a real shooting happens then kids are just gonna hide under desks or run, what else are they supposed to do?
Edit: I'm talking only about the unplanned random ones that no one was told about."
"530","I had a lockdown at my school when we had a drive in in the area. It took three hours, and during the lockdown the shooter hid in the parking lot of the school I was at!"
"531","my teacher said if we had a real lock down if one came INTO the classroom to grab anything and throw it at him/her"
"532","If it was fr and I was doing the arm flip thing I would bite the persons arm like really hard or try to gouge their eyes out or stab them"

"539","DARN IT THIS was filmed at my friends brothers school."
"540","bangbangbang hemmmm..."
"541","We have had so many lockdowns. we got a lockdown because of snakes and also clowns."
"542","When my school have lock down drills or fire drills they tell us on the day or week but not when so if it's during break, it's a lot more stressful cause you might be with a group of other kids or by yourself. Also when it's a lock down were supposed to hide under the desk and I'm around 6 feet tall so it's uncomfortable as fuck."
"543","why would they stay in the same place they can die all together."
"544","They should've blasted ""Pumped Up Kicks"" in the hallway instead of firing guns."
"545","what if someone kinda threw a pipe bomb I'm the room before he entered or maybe plastic explosives..."
"546","aaye my school"
"547","My teacher makes us take off our shoes and throw them at the intruder."

"549","Yes! they need to do these more because then people will take them seriously"
"550","DAAAAMMMMNN SHE WAS FIGHTING BACK😂😂"
"551","We have a lockdown drill this week but we don't know when of what day"
"552","for real throwing tennis balls at him i would have thrown a desk at him"
"553","In my school if you are outside using the bathroom (my halls are outside) and there is a code red the teachers aren't aloud to open the doors and you must fend for yourself. They did say you can run off campus but we have gates surrounding it so...yeah. May I also mention I was waiting outside with my class for my substitute to come and unlock the door when they called a code red drill and we were all still outside waiting... Yeah we would've all been dead."

"557","violent but they would attack them i grab 2 pencils and stab there eyes"
"558","I don't get the ""Go to the corner"" thing. Yeah, because it's not like it makes the innermost kids targets and makes the location obvious.... I don't think anybody ever won hide-and-seek by hiding in the corner... I like the part where they would give students dictionaries. Give the kids some areas to take cover, and some dictionaries, possibly hot coffee, and go ham on that shooter!!!"
"559","Can't there just be a safe under the teacher's desk with a gun that only the teacher can access so they can protect them from the shooter ?"
"560","one week we had a lockdown like that.we had a fake gunman screeching""GIT OUT THE CLASSROOM,IDIOTS.I GOT A GUN  AND I GONE GUN YO DOOR DOWN''It was our social worker.he barged in the class and I attacked him with a trash can,a apple,and a baseball.i keep my lucky braves one in my desk."

"614","Solution: instead of hiding children where a shooter could come in and see them, JUST GET A PEPPER SPRAY FOR EACH TEACHER AND CLASSROOM, oh and.. BAN GUNS FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A LICENCE FOR ONE!"
"615","You Go Girl"
"616","This is great idea to fight back the type of people doing these shooting are 100 pound kids that lost it so teaching them to fight back works it's not like when there's a shooting it's some buff military or strongman it's shitty little nerdy video game playing fuckers with a gun."
"617","the kids are 1.) going to be extremely traumatized or 2.) aren't going to take these things seriously cause they'll think it's just a drill"
"618","I have a great teacher. He tells us to break the window and run for the fire station (which is pretty close). Also, we have a hammer in the classroom lol.  All the other teachers at my school tell us to hide, its like bruh, where?"
"619","Back in the third grade, it was after school, but we had an active afterschool program, so there was a man that was injured, possibly covered in blood, he ran through the front gate and a lockdown was in place during that, obviously. He wasn't trying to harm anyone, but everyone thought he was trying to getting away from someone, like a policeman or a literal killer, but not much happened."
"620","lol when someone gets Juggernaut  from a care package"

"644","During an actual school shooting that happened at my school, we were not informed that there was an active shooter in the school because of the absence or ""echoeness"" of intercoms in the room we were in. We were all on stage, (It was a theatre) and the swat team came in and shouted at us, ""why aren't you in lockdown"", and our teacher walked up to him, looked him in the eye, or at least as good as he could get because of the shields they had on and said, ""excuse me, I'm having a class""..."

yeah im chucking a brick out the window and running nigga im out"
"656","You honestly dumb AF if you didn't look straight at the guy in the safety jacket and the camera man and notice something was up."
"657","our school does this but nobody gives a shit and keeps teaching. which is really concerning, given the fact that they don't specify if it is a drill or actually real."
"658","omg not even lying my principal came on the speakers like the other day and started saying like code red so I went to my book bag to get my phone and dialed 91 so Incase I need to dial 911 the 91 is already there.found out it was a drill.2days later fire alarm goes off everyone outside firetrucks came.principal speaker phone says FALSE ALARM. WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH MY SCHOOL....!!!!!!!"
"659","my school do not do lockdown"
"660","6:10 the gunman can choke her"
"661","I'm european what the fuck is this shit"
"662","My school doesn't have guns, they make us lay on the floor like dead fish"
"663","its just a prank bro"
"664","THE MINI MMMNM!I MMMNM!KMM I,M CHINESE"
"665","We blockade the door at my school district"
"666","I live in Australia so we don't get shot"
"667","i was on lockdown for almost 2 hours"
"668","I was taking a good shit one time"
"669","Our school did an unannouced drill at our school once, and once they said it was just a drill after the fact, I was pissed. Fear-tactics don't work, all you did was give me a mini-heart attack."
"670","Yo if there is a lockdown drill, you dont call your parents stupid! You gonna get your parents killed."
"671","During our last fire drill in school someone actually burned a curtain in the hallway ""to make it more realistic""."
"672","retarded girl if you see the police with guns you should feel a bit better and u shouldn't text ur parents"
"673","My school wants us to attack them"
"674","Murica'"
"675","So is this supposed to be a first world country?"
"676","lol 4th ave jr high bunch of gang"
"677","Ya congrats lets put kids in a corner and pull a gun on the kids because that is sooo smart!!!"
"678","At my highschool, the teachers have always told us to not only hide in the corner, if we're told the shooter is on one side of the building and we can get out through the window or doors, we will, and if they're too close we put tables and chairs infront of the door and by the time they open the door enough to shoot through or get in someone will have hit them in the head with a chair or something. Also, our doors automatically lock from the inside and the windows have chickenwire in between the panes."
"679","My classroom has a wall right next to the door and a sheriff came in and told us we had the safest classroom in the school :')"
"680","If it was real at my school I wouldn't be in the school in a second. I would already be at the police department. I would be long gone!"
"681","I want to do that training. Come on throwing tennis balls at a police men and tackling them it does not even seam like they are learning stuff but they are."
"682","Just get rid of guns America and start having an awareness of mental illness. By the way this is my opinion if you disagree thats yours."
"683","If you had a lockdown for 6 hours that means you didn't learn a lot of math"
"684","Right now I'm in 3rd grade but in 1st grade we had a lockdown for like only 5 minutes"
"685","I live in Colorado fuck yeahhhhh"
"686","ok I'm going to play devil's advocate here. Not to sound like a pessimist, by doing this you're showing the kids how the class and faculty is going to react during a school shooting. They're going to go through life, whatever trauma that occurs that starts them down the road of being a school shooter is going to happen, they're going to be the shooters themselves and now they now all tricks they will have to contend with. 

I think they have to get to the problem at its core. What leads a person to do something like that."
"687","ha ha football team.
they'll tackle the shooter"
"688","7:24 That guy has a sty or pink eye"
"689","my school did this. i said "" fuck"" and i ran  1 mile in  10 min. they had to find me 😂"
"690","Bishhhh if I'm in a school shooting I'm not gonna try to fight off the attacker, I'm gonna run I am not gonna try to be the hero. Not today hoe, not today"
"691","And so many people still believe we shouldn't have stricter gun laws"
"692","My lock down drills are way less scary. Jeezus Christ

5 Months Later: I recently had a real lockdown, a retired vietnam veteran was outside and maybe inside the building with a weapon. Police got here before anyone can get hurt. It scared me but at least we're ok. It was around the time of the san bernandino shooting.  But now I realize, for the sake of protecting kids, we should have lockdowns like this too"
"693","When I got shot it wasn't a drill"
"694","comparing this to my class... my class is loud asf."
"695","6:09 pulls out a knife and shanks her"
"696","A locked door isn't going to stop someone bound and determined to cause harm. If a shooter were in the hallway OPEN THE WINDOW AND GET OUT. That's your best bet in such a situation."
"697","Target a school that hasn't done a drill! :)"
"698","Um there is a thing called run hide and fight"
"699","During a drill this boy thought it was funny yelling bloody hell. My teacher put him outside."
"700","throw stuff protect your self I mean come on stupids"
"701","Uhm, using fake blood and volunteers for bodies? This isn't a movie set goddamn"
"702","I would grab scissors... Just throw it at them and pretend to be dead 😂"
"703","my fat ass teacher wouldnt be able to do anything but be a bullet shield"
"704","If there was a active shooter in my school I wouldn't be in the classroom."
"705","If someone really wants to kill, a door and shade won't stop them.......teachers need to be armed."
"706","my name is xavier"
"707","Thank you so much to the UK"
"708","I couldnt imagine being those kids in the drills, we had a fire drill once last year,we were told we were having a drill and we were told what to do bit still, it was really really scary (but it might be just me because I get scared really easily😂)"
"709","So i live in europe and we have this crazy thing where guns are illigal and we think this would be unimaginable."
"710","I live in Norway and have never witnessed a crime... except a dude taking way to much salt from MCdonalds. But i still go to school in Norway and the doors are unlocked, classroooms unlocked and we do not have any emergency drills except for fire drills. And our school cant go in lockdown, and doesn't have any safe rooms/ bunkers. And if we watch american gun control debates we are sitting there trying to drink bleach because the fact the people say they need their guns!"
"711","i'd grab my violin and wait near the door and when he comes in hit him in the head so hard ""Bonk!"""
"712","if there was a shooter at my school i wouldnt be sitting in a classroom...."
"713","I wish my school did this. It is better to fight back than let it happen."
"714","they just hit each other with the ten is balls, lol"
"715","Omg this is overboard asf"
"716","if the person comes and see them right bight and the shooter will kill them all be cues they are in one placr"
"717","Trying to tackle the shooter is the dumbest idea I've ever heard"
"718","My teacher said ""If the shooter is on the other side of the school we're gonna run! We're not gonna be sitting ducks. If the shooter is near we're gonna do the hiding thing."""
"719","Why is because they mite get killed or going tru a new place where nobody is"
"720","Middle shcool kids do get lost why because the alarms 🚨 are only for emergencys"
"721","Wow I'm so happy to be British right now"
"722","y are we beaing pussys and not fighting Back These teachers are the real mvps"
"723","It is actually safer for everyone to be spread out at their desks than in a corner. The reason why is because it is harder to shoot a gun than people realize, meaning there are more missed shots. If everyone is clumped together the likelihood of a shooter missing greatly drops."
"724","Y would u just sit in the corner. He has a GUN for Christ sake. I would just say fuck y'all. I'm out and I'd go out the window"
"725","There are still many scenarios where things can go to hell either way."
"726","Yo if there's a shooter I'm running not sitting in no pussy ass corner getting ready to die"
"727","Well it's preparing them for what could really happen"
"728","This never happens in canada"
"729","play pumped up kicks on the intercom"
"730","That's a cute teacher."
"731","We had legit Bomb threat no joke and it took last class 15 minutes to get out and we stood like 5 feet from building"
"732","It's all fun and game till first person gets shot"
"733","Holy shit. I wish they taught me this in my school."
"734","dude wasn't even trying to fight back"
"735","+Kaito wow,"
"736","+Kaito oh"
"737","Once 2 girls came with knives and stabbed teachers, so we had a 5 hour lock down."
"738","Jeanette Prioleau no stupid if u mean THROWING NON HURTABLE TENNISBALLS AT THEM THEN U WILL DIE."
"739","oh...."
"740","they do but I mean like a shooter active drill"
"741","you mean your school don't do practice lockdowns ???"
"742","Arno Dorian because no men applied for teaching. Now don't think only women can be teachers before the sjws come"
"743","xD"
"744","Aunt bowling day wear pink"
"745","*Attack the school shooters"
"746","Yeah dude I would (depending where the shooter is) just bolt out the nearest exit to the forest near our school"
"747","+Katnissjul It really is. I asked that question once to my 6th grade teacher and he said ""To be honest, I'd let you all barricade the doors and escape through the windows if I could, but the best I can do is jump in front of you and get myself killed first and maybe block the bullets for a few of you."""
"748","Deadly Turtle I think that's better. If you're in a real school shooting, the worst thing you can really do is sit in a corner with a bunch of other students. The shooter is going to aim for a group of students because they want to inflict the most damage. You have the best chance of surviving a shooting when you try to run away or hide."
"749","Well I'm just looking at something we do as Americans. We treat each other like garbage and at the same time we give ready access to weaponry. I'm actually surprised school shootings are not more common and were not really noticed before Columbine."
"750","David DeBergh Exactly. But then my liberal shit friend goes on about ""dangerus guns shuld be band 2 dngerus lik cops wil cim soon so don wury"""
"751","David DeBergh don't they lock the door"
"752","g I would go with non lethal weapons"
"753","Clorox Bleach Lol"
"754","i thought you would say ""id grab my violin and wait near the door and wjen he comes I would play a beautiful song"""
"755","LordlyWarrior42, Gaming, intros and More!! I would CAUSE when I would've gotten home my mom would've taken my life cause of how expensive the violin was."
"756","Kevin Gonzalez Yep! i wouldn't care if it broke, i'd save my life"
"757","Some schools, like mine, have a police officer in case some one decides to do a school shooting. It's happened once or twice back in the 1950s. But that's a long long time ago. "
"758","Dayson Boon my dchool has a bookshelf near the foor and both windows so we can barricade the room"
"759","howard baxter seriously though, whenever we do lockdowns we always sit in the corner. We should be standing at least to make it easier to get away."
"760","NoobDood preparing them on how they will all die? They should never be in a corner when someone breaks into the room cause it makes it easier for the gunman to kill everyone."
"761","They do these?!?!"
"762","that would be scary😱😱😱"
"763","america the land where you cant buy a kinder egg because health and safety but where you can go down the road and buy a semi automatic rifle"
"764","What if the shooter has Sleight of Hand for his first perk?"
"765","I'd love to see my Swedish mid 40's calm teacher do this"
"766","f that my school say we on lock down cause of a shooter I fucking out the window no matter what floor I'm on"
"767","I'm in middle school and ever since kindergarten we've done lockdown drills... but we all just hide in a corner, I feel like the younger we were, the more serious everyone took it."
"768","OR, OR, OR...you could impose stricter gun control"
"769","Wow there strong"
"770","If it was me in that drill I would be having a panic attack not even kidding. Just watching gave me anxiety"
"771","I've been in a real one and all that happened was students huddled in a corner in their classes and peeing in mop buckets"
"772","we only have one shooting drill a year"
"773","In my school we have only have a fire alarm once a year and no one is really taking that serious"
"774","May i ask why the fuck they hide behind a fuxking desk and are not barricading the door with shit instead"
"775","Wow, shoothing drills are as common as fire drills in the US. School shootings never happen in Europe, I don't understand why it's so easy to get a gun in the States considering all those school shoothings."
"776","Get all footballl and rugby players at the door expecialy the linemen."
"777","At my schools when they do drills the teachers are like 'Everyone shush' all these little jerks start talking and like boi"
"778","you know this seems like a bad idea if you have all the students in one place you're just making yourself the easiest Target in the world."
"779","oh fuck that I'm trippin bitches pulling weaves I ain't dying in a shooting. I'd rather go out dying from overeating at McDonald's."
"780","One of my teachers told us that if there was ever a real lockdown, she'd fight and welcomes anyone to back her up instead of making us sitting ducks."
"781","This is more of an effective drill than the retards at my high school do."
"782","We have lunch outside at my school and although there wasn't a fake shooter we had to run to the nearest room inside the school it was pretty spooky"
"783","Sophia the fiiiiiiiiirst"
"784","So what about this while the teacher is fighting a student should get siccosrrs and get em but only if it's real"
"785","in my school if this happens my teacher who has a knife grabs it's it has us all hide in a closet and if all else my teacher will grab us and run out as fast as we can"
"786","🎶🎶all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 🎶🎶🎶"
"787","🎶🎶all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 🎶🎶🎶"
"788","Why can't we have the badass teachers from Yandere Simulator? Thay are bosses."
"789","In a school shooting why the fuck would they want us sit on our knees in the dark. That won't help he'll come in and start no scoping"
"790","lmao only in america"
"791","In my school we don't have shooting drills because people aren't allowed guns"
"792","my school puts us in a middle room that conects to a 1st grade class and thats where I hide"
"793","when she was fighting back i was so happy to see how much effort she gave😊"
"794","my shool 20 m"
"795","The shortest lock down I ever had was 40 minutes and it was a drill"
"796","God, just have someone go in (maybe with a toy gun) and explain to the kids what you are supposed to do in that situation."
"797","one time we had a lock down I was like noway my friends were praying and finally it was over the police was there"
"798","They lock the door to day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"799","It's good preparation to use a fake gun to bring the message home but not for small children. Even if they just had the guy walk in the room and say ""bang,"" really loudly, the kids wouldn't be overly shaken but they'd get it. That would work better with kindergarten students."
"800","Has anyone ever wondered ""Why TF are there windows on the doors if people are going to go shoot up a school?!"" because I see it more as a threat and an even bigger threat if there's a tornado."
"801","I have having a lockdown and it was scary I want there was a real bad guy in our building of school and they actually killed one kid and they arrested that man because the police were there and we attacked them with some balls when they into our classrooms our school is really protected because we know what we should do because I am in high school😭😭"
"802","How did you get that good"
"803","The procedure has changed at my high school, you have three choices now: run, hide, or fight. If your class is near an exit they have you run to the edge of campus during a drill. Still scary though when your teacher is yelling at you to run like shit"
"804","I'm white but 99.9% of the time is a white person shooting up a school it's really rare to get someone black or Spanish or Asian"
"805","I'm terrified of this kinda stuff already also lockdown drills are not new for me :/ WE HAVE THEM EVERY MONTH and least for them they say it's a drill FoR them but not for me
At least we don't have a fake shooter tho"
"806","If im facing the barrel of a gun im doing one of two things..... Either getting shot or running in the other direction😂"
"807","We just mess around in the corner of the room"
"808","""MURICA ....FUCK YEAH"""
"809","I go to a high school called Marcus, its a huge school with tons of kids, and every day I feel so unsafe there, anybody can just walk into the school, and there is absolutely no security at all. We haven't had a lock down drill in over a year, and those don't even help, we are just taught to sit in the class room, yeah, what's that gonna do? Its just gonna ensure to the shooter that we are not going to run away and they they can just walk into a classroom and shoot us all. I bet you could walk through the front doors with a bomb vest without anyone noticing, its the way they built the school with too many damn entrances that makes me feel like someone could fuck shit up real easily."
"810","Do they really think kids will stay this calm if a SHOOTER comes to their school and try to kill them."
"811","If you are in the library in my school there are 2 closets you put like 30_ kids in them lock and black it out during black outs"
"812","Last year, I remember that my  class had a shelter in place for like 15-20 min. I don't know what happend but it was kinda scary but funny at the same time cause a police came in the classroom and we all screamed cuz we thought that the door was locked lol"
"813","I think it's good that they have drills but damn actual weapons used? If it's a fire drill you don't start an actual fire :/"
"814","Wish I still went to an all black school so we didn't need triggered white peo-... I mean school shooter drills."
"815","I went though it in kinder garden our bank gilt robbed then there was a shooter we hid in a bathroom hallway for 5 hours...."
"816","3:53   My class in our practice lockdown when the principal came in"
"817","""all the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run faster than my bullet"""
"818","That one teacher fought back so hard she really put up a fight like damn"
"819","This looks awesome."
"820","we have lockdown every day for 2hours"
"821","Just bite his penis off or kick her in the tits"
"822","THIS is gun control?"
"823","this week in my school where going to have a lockdown"
"824","If i had a school shoot down I'd throw chairs and dictionaries before kicking his BALLS so hard they bust"
"825","I feel like we really only have one a year, but God forbid we miss one a month"
"826","the kids would kick the gunman as well"
"827","how many likes can we get for this safety video?😉"
"828","LOL"
"829","the drill"
"830","this looks fun"
"831","This is dumb."
"832","I had a real drill and I went to the bathroom and I went to the hall seeing a assault rifle I stayed inside the stall locking it and I looked at the hall there was no one the so I whet to the nearest class and a kid was pooping on a trash bag and I was so afraid to go back I staid in there hearing the kid and when he was done we when in to the class it lasted the whole school day untill police came"
"833","Havent watched the whole thing yet, but when Holly was taking down the man when he was fighting back, she put it at a point where the gun was aiming at her leg and if this was real he couldve shot her.."
"834","OOOOH that person got rekt"
"835","I HAVE WATCHED THIS SHIT OVER 6 TIMES NOW LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE"
"836","I've never had a lockdown at either of my schools- but maybe it's just because we don't do that kind of thing in the UK"
"837","Put all the students together in one space
Dafuq is dat , scatter the students around to make it look like the room is empty"
"838","this will not work 100% of the time if the gunner needs to refill this would work better but if the gunner is full of bullits then it wolnt work as well... basically you want it so that the gunner cant pull the trigger cause wile on the ground the gunner can still shoot"
"839","I like how when they were doing the last training when the teachers fought back in the gym the gun was going everywhere  and imagine how many people could have been shot"
"840","and 40 class's in my school and my class was the frist class in the hoal school and I'm 3red grade"
"841","and school just started"
"842","cuz he shot a lot of bolits"
"843","we pretended to be dead"
"844","I had one like this but for reel he came into my class and akshley shot a kid"
"845","We had one of those in our school it was well scary"
"846","I used to almost cry during lockdown drills as a kid."
"847","but thats so stupid, a school shooter is most of the time a student at the school. and by doing this the shooter know exactly where the kids are.. like wtf"
"848","WHY DO YOU HAVE FAKE DEAD BODIES EVERYWHERE!!! I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SAFE DRILL FOR EVERYONE"
"849","this is why I changed my mind about becoming a teacher"
"850","my school for some dumb reason puts on the fire alarm after a lockdown, THATS NOT GONNA GET US KILLED AT All😐"
"851","What teacher leaves the door unlocked"
"852","Ive done a lock down drill the same amount of times a tornado drill or fire drill since i was in kindergarten and i live in one of the most nice neigborhoods in my town but not to this extent"
"853","If this was real I would just run around the room if they tried to shoot me so they couldn't aim at me"
"854","my school didnt have the guns but the security guards would go around screaming and banging on doors saying that they are going to kill everyone."
"855","My art teacher has a bat next to his door and there's a shop,on the side and he said he would hide us in there and if they were near to run out the door in the shop that leads outside. And in band we have a secret room behind a bookcase (it isn't as magical as you think) so I know what classes I'd like to be in"
"856","Right, go ahead and try to take down a shooter. You'll be shot and killed in seconds."
"857","my schools fire drill is us running into a church and hiding
i guess fire doesnt wanna meet jesus idk"
"858","one of my friends thought it wasnt a drill and i was laughing cause he looked sacred and he was like "" be quiet im gonna die because of you "" 😂😂😂😂"
"859","we had a lock down at our school once but it was a drill and everyone knew it was a drill but you know what my health teacher did anyway? she took a bunch of desks and chairs and piled them up in front of the door. then when the principal tried to come in to tell us it was safe, he couldn't open the door. it was quite funny actually."
"860","Who knew that teachers could be that cool"
"861","Brutal Vulture isn't it a pretty lax process though? It's harder to get one here in Canada if I'm not mistaken"
"862","official explosive music and gaming you don't just go buy a gun,there a process into getting one"
"863","official explosive music and gaming So fucking true!"
"864","Zebras101 Yeah I'm on my school wrestling team I'm 84 pounds and can take down a 142 pound guy"
"865","Not strong, smart. All it takes is shifting their weight the right way."
"866","Ya"
"867","Cameron Titus 
Oh okayyy...

Srry😶😐😬"
"868","+Nikki Whyte I cant understand what they are saying. Maybe i could empathize if i could understand"
"869","Cameron Titus 
This person is talking about a scary lockdown and u r hating on their grammar?? Thats messed up. Wtf"
"870","Mily Rivera wtf is this comment. Use some punctuation"
"871","*one fire drill"
"872","It was at 5:50 btw"
"873","My school had a real shooting thing but luckily the guy with the gun before he killed anyone the police came and killed him"
"874","it can be silly though because what if a real shooter knows there is going to be a drill and comes in and does his shit and people would not know"
"875","the school shooting close to sheridan took about 7 hours"
"876","What its like inside America"
"877","I think people no when a shade is down and everyone classroom has one down that there is people in there"
"878","what if they had a knife in their pockets"
"879","let me tell you something if the school shooters outside your door or in your room... dont sit down go down with a fight use scissors throw books"
"880","my school did a drill did this before and when my teacher told me to hide by the desks I walk out of the class room and hid in the bathroom 😂😂😂😂😂"
"881","When I was in second grade it was toward the end of the year we were having a big school picnic outside and my friend and I were jumping in a bounce house and a teacher called over to the students and said that a man was heading toward the school. we had to go inside and we couldn't eat because the lockdown lasted 3 hours. A man was going around the school. then our class  seen a shadow with a knife by our classroom and I was terrified. I was bawling my eyes out."
"882","Things in America Have gone outta hand...Well when you dont got Monarchists or Fasicsts to kill they shoot Democratics... Get a grip on FFS"
"883","if i were a teacher i would be like:

      throwing the desk at the shooter fite me"
"884","This is exactly the opposite what my class does during lockdown"
"885","Pretty sure putting all the kids really close together behind a desk is a bad idea, just saying :/"
"886","if a shooter came to my school I wouldn't run there are 3 options in a shooter situation run, hide, or fight so if some one is shooting up my school I'm gonna secure myself in a place were the shooter can't see me then I'm gonna jump out behind him and beat his ass"
"887","What is the point of drills when the shooter knows that everyone is hiding in their classrooms."
"888","I rather get shot in the chest than shot in the back"
"889","When students throw harmful light balls at a armed person with weapons I know this is fake but if I was real"
"890","The guys protesting letting kids get involved in taking down a shooter, but let's face it, America has already decided that they value the shooter above the victims. If they did care, they'd outlaw guns and prevent them from being able to get onto campus. Then they wouldn't need training or emergency drills."
"891","YEAH LETS GO TEACHERS! lol😂"
"892","This is so bad hide in classroom?"
"893","Wow 130 my car goes 200 up"
"894","it should be 
run
lock
fight
you run but if there is nowhere to go you hide if the shooter finds you Then you fight that's how my teacher taught me"
"895","They are all pussys"
"896","I have learned Knife throwing just incase"
"897","My teachers gave some of our students jobs. One persons job was to grab the flag and beat the crap out of the shooter. Everyone else was instructed to do whatever we could to take em down. My chorus teacher brings a screwdriver into our saferoom"
"898","This morning we were doing a practice  drill. It was just horrible, kids kept on talking, banging the desk, the vice principal had to come in keep them down. Thank god that was just practice."
"899","I would have thrown my chair at the shooter, or my worst insults. They hurt pretty bad, I know because I got them when they were used against me"
"900","I would have like went crazy"
"901","I mean this is affective... lol"
"902","my school would be fine.Half the kids have guns in their locker.Were a small army.Btw I live in a GHETTO af school"
"903","if there's actually someone at my school I'm jumping out the window and running through the woods to the highway"
"904","Now that people of columbine tell their story it's

Classroom speakers and hallway speaker principle
SAY ""LOCK DOWN THIS IS NOT A DRILL LOCK DOWN THIS IS NOT A DRILL""
*Hangs up*



were all scared the teacher closes the curtains 
one student covers the door window and locks
it before the student could close the door.........
a teacher comes running in and hides with us in 

the corner









9:23

3 minutes have passed we hear people screaming
things falling
but no gunshots no noise so silent too silent 


one student started laughing and thought it was

a drill the teacher said whispering (shh shutup your going to get us killed)

after 5 minutes of silence we hear someone come near our door
I was so scared I was so tempted to cry but I knew it would be bad
then the killer starts trying to open
the door*door knob shaking*

we all got scared but he went away


police were in the building 


later that day 

the speakers went they said ""All clear""
*hangs up*

when I got home I told my mom she said she knew

because she saw a lot of police outside the school

there was only 1 victim I feel so bad for that victim

thank god that I survivdd

this is a true story"
"905","i would rko that bitch"
"906","How 2 Beat a School Shooter 101 :

1. tackle the shooter (head first) If it's a boy, go for le nasty, if it's a girl, go for the boobies.

2. Bite them until they start to bleed, has to be on the wrist the gun is at.

3. Grab the gun, and throw it at the wall ( try to throw it extremely hard to break it).

4. Crack a chair on their head if they try to get up.

5. When they become conscious again, make sure to take off their shoes and socks. and surround them in Legos to the police come. Legos are evil...."
"907","Columbine was fucking lit😎😎😏😏"
"908","Whatever happened to barricading the damn doors?"
"909","SKY VIEW IN COLORADO MY FRIEND GO'S TO THAT SCHOOL"
"910","I'm just a comment don't hate"
"911","Once we were at school and were practicing a lockdown drill, and 2 minutes after the drill was lifted, we had an actual emergency lockdown. Scared the crapt out of me"
"912","Is it weird that I want this drill to happen to me?"
"913","(Peter Griffin voice) why aren't we funding this?"
"914","The reality is nobody is gonna be sitting in a corner thinking that a shade covering a tiny window in a door is gonna make the shooter move on. A normal locked door isn't gonna do anything either. If this happens and you can't escape then you barricade the door with the teachers desk etc. or break a window have all the guys take off their shirts make a rope with the shorts by using simple knots and then shimmy down the rope. If you aren't gonna do the above, then you choose to sit in a corner, wait for the shooter to come in with a automatic weapon, probably not using a pistol ( most likely ) and then you will get sprayed down. That's the reality. A normal locked door with a sheet of paper over it isn't gonna do anything."
"915","believe me, if there is an aspiring school shooter in one of those classes this drill would just pump them up...."
"916","One time in my old school an intruder came into the gymnasium and was left w/ a broken arm after my p.e teacher rugby tackled him😂"
"917","America!
Where apparently this is the solution!"
"918","7:56 i would love to throw tennis balls at my music teacher"
"919","next: school shooting without a drill"
"920","its stupid how they sis that yes train the teachers but spend the money to add basic strong locks to the doors and pullit proof glass to the doors. you see at 3:49 they come in the door and the teachers take them down well if the school would have hade bullet proof glass or even just covering added to the windows a lock to the door and a drop down bar or other locking system to lock the door and secure it the door would never ben opened. and if thay wanted even more protection they could have armed the teachers with pute mil grade peper spray and handcuffs and rubber bullets enuff to stop anyone"
"921","holy shit her taking down that 220 guy fighting back gave me an adrenaline rush"
"922","Pfft, our drill is to hide in a corner and lock the door.
I asked if some of us could hide under the large drawing board or in the closet or under the sink, they answered ""No, because not everyone can hide like that and it wouldn't be fair""
I asked them about what happens if they brake down the door or window and actually search the classroom to see the 28 kids sitting on a mat in the corner of the room, they answered ""let's hope that doesn't happen""
I asked what if it does
They answered ""No more 'what if's! Or you'll be seeing the principal!

Stupid... the shooters are crazy and might brake down the door and see us right next to it because, BIG SURPRISE! USUALLY SCHOOL SHOOTERS DON'T HAVE COMMON SENSE!"
"923","Shooter: PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

Me: LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE!

Student: BUT WE DO CARE"
"924","i had a school lockdown drill last month and everyone in my class did a good job with being quiet and following directions :)"
"925","One time we had a lockdown drill and it lasted for 1 hour and I fell asleep XD"
"926","We Never Have Lockdown Drills....."
"927","The reporter is such a pansy."
"928","If I had a shooter I'm 7 but I know tactics I would wait by the door and tackle him or do the classic leg sweep"
"929","HOW TO STOP SCHOOL SHOOTINGS:
>Ban guns."
"930","The teachers had way too much fun throwing the balls, laughing and what not.
Great video. Very helpful"
"931","If I had to take the gun from him I would use those moves but I would bite him :)"
"932","Jody, bless her big heart. <3"
"933","I agreed with all this right up until they said enlist the kids. Umm no, can we not use the children to subdue an armed person please?"
"934","it's mostly/ only in America but what makes this sad is the fact that they have to have drills for it. I don't see this happening in any other school in different countries"
"935","I think it's better to not tell them it's a drill, I think it's more effective. But fake guns and wounded kids is a bit much."
"936","I so sincerely wish Granite School DIstrict would do something like this.  It doesn't matter to me how much it might scare them; I hope it would scare the kids and staff enough to get themselves some self-defense training to learn how to take down, and maybe kill, an active shooter who might be trying to terrorize the campus he/she might be attacking."
"937","I don't know what type of children these are but when we do this there's always one asshole who has to make a noise"
"938","there was a real shooting at my old school and we where in lock down from 10 am till 3pm and there was 7 shooters in the school at the time and they killed 2 people it was so scary hearing the shooting and all the screams in the room down the hall"
"939","Our school just straight up bans phones during lockdowns"
"940","My lockdown drills in my high school lasts about 10-25 minutes"
"941","So now school shooters know where the kids hide thanks to abc news"
"942","that's stupid I'd feel really scared cause I'm only 10"
"943","ARMY OF PEOPLE ATTACKING 1 PEOPLE :ooo
I wish my school was like that"
"944","My school legit takes every drill as a joke and screaming their asses off in class but at least the door is barricaded with like 4 tables and a shit ton of desks and chairs"
"945","Don't hide in a real shooting break the window and climb out"
"946","moi"
"947","We had a real lock down. Everybody was crying and we thought we we're going to die. A kid next to me had a panic attack. We heard a knock on the door and I had to cover a kids mouth from screaming. Thank god it was a false alarm. I still remember my hand shaking so hard I couldn't open my locker to get my backpack later. I still have dreams about what would've happened if it was real."
"948","0:50 The girl was like "" hi mom, mom I'm on TV"" 😂😅 I can tell she has never seen a camera 😂😂😂😅"
"949","if there was an actual lockdown during my fifth hour the shooter would definetly know we were in the room because of a couple idiots would fart and then laugh about it. (no joke)"
"950","Lmao I'm actually in Canada and never once in my academic life did we get a school shooting lockdown drill."
"951","Our school is fucking bull-shit. Nobody takes this seriously. Everyone hides in the most obvious places although we have have closets in our rooms. And everyone is fucking talking and giggling."
"952","what if the shooter has a knife too? then if you get him while he is reloading, you're also dead"
"953","There was a shooter in school and a kid threw a gigantic book at him and everyone started throwing stuff at him and my teacher knocked him down"
"954","When we get a lock down our teacher says get your math books or something heavy to throw at the people"
"955","That's why you're always friends with the school shooter, you don't wanna be on on his list"
"956","The fact you cunts need this pisses me off, Fucking freaks"
"957","Wait...did they just throw a bunch of balls at him in hopes to stop a shooter?..."
"958","The scariest thing that happenes at my school is a fire allarm"
"959","what if a shooter watched the video or was in a drill"
"960","haha so stupid that people have to do this like Australia had the biggest massacre ever and guns were banned now theres basically no gun crime. after a us shooting their like ""maybe just ban the big guns"" like their called assault rifles not protection rifles"
"961","Just use school safe to FRIGGIN LOCK THE DOOR YOU IDIOTS"
"962","Killers be like: Everyone get out so I can kill you!!!

Everyone else: No I think we'll stay here

Killer: Oh well ok Im just gonna go get Starbucks."
"963","When your school doesnt even do this and never have drills"
"964","Well to be honest never hide in the fucking corner, it just makes it way easier for someone to get you easier, fight back and you have a way higher chance at living. It is terrible what they do but, fight back."
"965","my school does that fake blood thing. During a drill they'll place ""dead bodies"" in classroom while staff members go find them. This is all for practice but pretty neat. My friends and I saw C's on doors and didn't know what they were. They were on every door so i decided to ask another one of my friend. She told me that if theres a C on the door that tells other staff members that theres no body and the room is clear, if theres an X, that means they found a body. The whole drill took like 40 minutes and the whole school was outside, board, woundering when we could go back inside. Me and my friend built a little dirt hill to pass the time"
"966","I don't understand everyone in the comments claiming that we should just simply ban guns... yarg."
"967","If they make it seem real it'll be a boy who cried wolf situation"
"968","0:34 WHY SCARY KIDS EVEN MORE PRETENDING BREAKING INTO A SCHOOL WHILE U CAN JUST PRACTICE HIDING IN UR CLASSROOM INCASE IF IT IS REAL?"
"969","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks, you better run, better run, outrun my gun."
"970","I would wait at the door, wait for him to come in, jump on his back, and bite the ship out of his neck, beat his head,bite him some more, get off, jump on him a few times, kick his elbow, and disarm him. I would then give the teacher the gun, or theater to shoot him  while pointing it at his head. I have some other ideas as well, sick as getting a pencil or large pair of scisors, and then open the scissors and slash his face. I don't think I'm confident enough to stab people yet, but I will kill if I have to. running is useless, unless you go around a lot of corners. sitting there just depends on the shooters actions."
"971","when she was fighting the guy he wasn't trying he could have beat her and shot her holding one arm dosnt do anything"
"972","Wow I wish my school did this what we have is turn lights off lock a doors d hide in a corner"
"973","Yes but at least a large majority would be limited/out of the way. It's not a foolproof measure, but if you want proof of its efficiency, look at Australia/UK. Mass shootings have all but been wiped out."
"974","EvieH people can still get guns of the black market and other ililligall ways of geting weapons"
"975","That being said, I am so goddamn proud of those teachers."
"976","ikr, getting to test ur defense lol"
"977","Same tho it acc looks lit"
"978","BakerGamer123 I would be mad as fuck if they did this unexpecticted."
"979","Alright than.+hgxnorton"
"980","I ain't no nigga"
"981","Agreed"
"982","+Pia Purplegarden stfu plz"
"983","Wolves rock395 same the names are Chris here many and all the stupid idiot boys that happened and I kicked the Farts right outta dem😏"
"984","My name is Patrick Star and desks or scissors. My school's fine with that if it's real."
"985","Grant Holmes in a real situation tho, theyd fuckin throw books and shit"
"986","Natalie Nathan 'a person'

IM DIEING!"
"987","Grant Holmes lmao"
"988","Natalie Nathan a person? HAHAHAHAHA TOO FUNNY"
"989","Honestly the shooting drills are neccesary with everything that's been going on. The kids need to know"
"990","I think it's a good idea because I forgot it's pointing down and I can put my kids it will probably hit the person who shouldn't on the leg but I think it's a good deal because it's like it's like you're fighting back and the kids won't get her and the kids are like helping so yeah it's a good drill I'd say at my school I would definitely do that drill I think other schools could do the same Grill all schools in America that do the same drills it's really good and the kids and the parents should support that Amvets the drill good thinking or North Carolina South Carolina to Colorado Orlando Florida places like that where there's more shooting email should really consider that. Cuz it's a really good job drill and they should think about it and that's the best girl I've ever seen I was doing. But we should consider that places like that where they're shooting should consider that but that is good job for taking care of our kids"
"991","Should supply teacher with a bat so they can at least defend them self"
"992","And there is people who are fans of those two people who where the shooters from columbine(it's mostly girls who think they are attractive but they are actually pretty ugly"
"993","if my school let us fight then I would tackle"
"994","What do you call a five year old with no friends? A sandy hook survivor."
"995","I honestly don't think this is to far... There was a lock down at the middle school I used to go to and all the kids were laughing but just outside was a fauther threating his children, other children, and anyone who was gonna try to stop him... I wish they did this because every room had huge ceiling to floor Windows and he was a huge guy who could have easily broken a window and if it wasnt for the time and how close some offercers were they said kids could have died cause we didnt take is seriously...

I believe they should call the parents and tell them it is a drill but it would be good for kids because 90% of kids think drills are jokes.."
"996","We don't have shooting dills because we have armed men!"
"997","they don't tell us we're having a lockdown (lock & cover) drill until after the drill so most of the time our lights are still on and we're still doing class work"
"998","I'm my school we used to just sit there in the corner of a room but they changed it and now they tell us to run out of the school as quickly as you can. instead of like a fire drill, we don't walk super slow in lines we just run and get out. we're also aloud to use self defence if we need to. I think more schools should do it like that."
"999","my school also uses saxon math books"
"1000","3:53 Teacher #2 Used ""Jerk off on the shooter on camera"""
"1001","just take a second to recognize that the teachers never locked the doors"
"1002","harambe took better care of that child than that lady like if you agree"
"1003","welcome to America"
"1004","Teacher: DONT FIGHT THE SHOOTER! Me: *Throws bananas at da shooter* Told you I'm amazin XD"
"1005","*Texts Mom: Hey mom there's a shooter but don't worry I'm Undertale trash so I can handle this mom.* DODGE DODGE BANG BANG!!!"
"1006","We had one last year but it was real we didn't know about it until it was all over at first we thought it was a drill turns out it wasn't thank God no one was hurt."
"1007","My school had a lockdown and someone was in the back with a gun we were on lockdown for 2 to 4 hours"
"1008","My school just makes us sit in the floor in a dark place. And people will like knocking the door and pushing evry thing went well cause it was a drill"
"1009","6:00 - 6:25 Basic toribash fights in a nutshell."
"1010","My defense is scratching, biting, and spitting."
"1011","I love how everyone throws the tennis balls. xD"
"1012","100 likes and I'll shoot up my school"
"1013","DOAMERICAGREATAGAIN IS NOT THIS..."
"1014","REALLY AMERICA?.."
"1015","Listen. Sitting with a closed door in a dark corner won't stop bullets. This is how we practice it in my school, and to be completely honest, I would open the window ( fairly easy to do at my school) and sprint off campus to call 911. BUT! I do have a police man on campus at all times, so unless he wasn't there, I wouldn't resort to this. But no, not gonna hide in a corner. Ridiculous"
"1016","It's sad they even need these"
"1017","He was just resisting her efforts to *disarm* him. If they were actually fighting, bad things would happen."
"1018","What a battle cry at 6:13...."
"1019","you don't have to plan for it just run from any white kid with a trench coat"
"1020","I go to a Military Academy and our SAI said that if the room got broken into, the SAI would attack the intruder and we would all jump him"
"1021","do not say i'm going to kill you all"
"1022","One time some kid made a phone threat to the main highschool and all the kids on the south side ot the county had to go on full lockdown(me) and all the kids on the northside got a lockout. the people on lockdown had to sit in a corner for 30 minutes! They arrested the kid who did it though."
"1023","What they should do is train the kids not to bring a gun/weapon to school."
"1024","Damn the teacher were strong"
"1025","Jk i love this drilp"
"1026","Ohh u didnt ohhhh ur getting sewed for copyright"
"1027","fffr did you get permisoin to use this song"
"1028","how do you prepare student's and teachers from a school shooter well nothing obviously you can't 

1.hiding doesn't work
2 .hiding under objects doesn't work
3. staying silent doesn't work 

it's useless."
"1029","I think this is great. I'm a student and at my school all we do is hide behind our desks. With the kind of freedom we have with guns, the schools should be prepared for the worst."
"1030","I know I'm gonna sound really stupid by saying this, but it only recently clicked in my mind that school shootings like Columbine and Sandy Hook and many others are the reasons why we've started doing these lockdown drills. I grew up doing them and I just went along with it. I never questioned why we were doing them when I was little. I even used to think that my parents had done them when they were in school (which they probably didn't). Now that I understand why we do these drills, everything just feels scarier and more real."
"1031","I would love to tackle a criminal and break there arm! and plus so they can't shoot that well when it's broke XD."
"1032","In my opinion,i think this is correct,if a real shooting happened then you wouldn't be told that its going to happen,its preparing the students incase it did happen,but the parents should of been notified.(Probably that one dumb parent who tells their kid its gonna happen.)"
"1033","dude it's like if anybody went to school and is a school shooter, they already know all the fucking kids are in a corner so hiding in the corner fucks everybody"
"1034","ah norway truly a safe place"
"1035","the way they where training would fuck everyone in the room if it was a real life situation the shooter would be firing in all directions  and u can't always w8 for a reload what if the shooter has a drumb mag"
"1036","These are good drills because the shooter feels as if they have 100% of the power and will not think they will retaliate."
"1037","That was good because the gun never went on her but could fly across the classroom"
"1038","YOU HUDDLE IN THE CORNER. YOU WILL GET SHOT. YOU WILL DIE."
"1039","they're showing the teachers tackling them to get the shooters down.. dude I ain't about to get the shooter mad by tackling him, I'd rather run and get shot a few times then fail and get everyone else in my classes get shot because I tried being a hero and failed tf? but it sucks because my high school doesn't have windows in the classroom, so I'm basically dead no matter whay"
"1040","we did that once but a girl was just going sico and me and two other kids went to a fith grade class it was when I was in 3 grade she trew sizors I was scared 💩less I thought I was going to die and she buillied me and every body elese in the class"
"1041","Life lesson: If I ever see a gunmen I'll just throw a chair at them"
"1042","He was doing a 130 well m' am he would have lost control"
"1043","It's always the quiet ones"
"1044","This is why I bring a gun to school."
"1045","At my school they do grades separately and I'm so lucky I'm in 4th cus they do it during P.E. and the first time they did it even the teachers were screaming."
"1046","in my school we have a bathroom we loke the door and loke areself in the bathroom and we are safe"
"1047","i aint hiding behind shit am breaking the window in the class room and running my ass home."
"1048","our school has changed from lockdowns to the ""ALICE"" method which is basically leaving your class to make their own decision of baracade the door or run out of the building"
"1049","WTF? No way will this work not unless you swop for a steven segal in every classroom. Give it another few years and every teacher in USA will have a side arm either hidden or open i can see it coming.The next generation of kids will have to carry as part of their school uniform like some crazy 80s movie set in the future! Sounds Daft? Watch this space.........!?!?!"
"1050","See the thing is if a student is doing they know where the students are."
"1051","Head lock and then getting the arm that the gun is held behind the back, Thats what I would do :P"
"1052","I went on lockdown cause of clowns I'm serious I had scissors"
"1053","I was in that school"
"1054","MAN!!! I wish this was my school"
"1055","It's just unbelievable that this is even a thing! Don't you agree that if you have 1 active shooting a month for 15 years straight you have a problem with your gun laws/management? I'm not saying take away your guns just accept that what you have now isn't working and isn't safe, for you or the poor children who are trained to live in fear of this!"
"1056","we're not practicing our deaths, we are practicing how to not die. (im in 7th grade)"
"1057","Maybe this should not be enacted with elementary school kids or middle school kids."
"1058","tf that 7th grader your not supposed to use your phones in a lockdown"
"1059","What the actual fuck is it that hard to just to restrict guns?! Like you have fires and fire drills, but you have fire extinguishers and you restrict who you sell lighters to. Should be the same with guns!"
"1060","I did a lot of this in high school and middle school, but I still fail to see it's efficacy. If a shooter is in the building, your first instinct should be to run, not hide in a room with one exit and minimal cover and hope he doesn't find you."
"1061","lol pretty intense for a drill. I like it."
"1062","I'll be honest with yeah if there's police with weapons drawn at a school then there's no need to fear the shooter can do little harm to children in that case"
"1063","One teacher I had made us go behind her desk as she stood next to her cabinet that she put next to a door during a lock down. Now, you see, the cabinet 1, blocks the view of the children, and 2, if the so called shooter came in, she just bashed the 300 lbs filing cabinet on him. HAHA! I felt safe."
"1064","New Jersey they have to do two of these, and counts as a monthly security drill as in New Jersey under permanent statues requires two emergency preparedness drills (one fire drill, and one security drill) to be conducted for each month that school is in session."
"1065","What up with white kids shooting  schools 😂"
"1066","What the heck. We don't do this. We have drills but we sit in the dark with the doors locked and someone goes around shaking door handles. But not this. This is crazy"
"1067","Maybe you should lock the door. Just a thought"
"1068","I had a school lockdown on Thursday."
"1069","The fuck? Why didn't they lock the door?"
"1070","nice job schools you just told shooters what your gonna do safe!!!!"
"1071","My schools don't even do these drills and they act like we know what to do. This makes me really upset.  I had a serious lockdown in my school, I was in 4th grade. Someone got shot by a basketball right near the school. My principal did nothing about it."
"1072","At my school when you we have a lockdown we turn off our iPads"
"1073","well its about fucking time you stop taking your saftey fro granted and it took how many shootings real or fake ?"
"1074","during a lockdown i would run at the guy with a wooden table because atleast i would have a better chance"
"1075","We used to have to all go in one corner now we just go under our desk and we don't even practice it lmao"
"1076","in kindergarten we had a suprise lock down I cried I front of anyone"
"1077","I think that it went too far"
"1078","So cringe"
"1079","this is amazing they should start doing this in every school, i think its good because then when the real thing is happening they wouldnt be so much afraid"
"1080","All the other kids in the pumped up kicks..."
"1081","our school sucks that's why no body comes"
"1082","I had a lock down but it was fake All other lock downs are fake whyy"
"1083","fuck that shit, run. Don't be sitting ducks, run blocks away from that shit lmao. at our school if theres a fire they want everyone to meet in the middle of the school on the GRASS. Lol"
"1084","We dont have any shooting drill"
"1085","Why would they put them together when one shoot can kill 10 at the same time"
"1086","the drills are stuiped today's there is a lot of things people can do noe"
"1087",""
"1088","I want one of these but I already trained my self"
"1089","The One with the kids throwing plastic balls was on point tho xD"
"1090","And in all honesty, sitting in the back of the room in the dark is not gonna save you. So I actually like what they're teaching the teachers. Though instead of a takedown I personally prefer to go for the throat with a pair of scissors, but that's just me."
"1091","And at least alert the parents."
"1092","the clowns went to my school and i had to goon loke down and i had pepper spray with me"
"1093","Damn white kids"
"1094","What's with the kids when they did the drill? In my school when there's a drill, all the kids just scream and shit"
"1095","I never understood why we sat in a corner where in an actual situation we would all be mowed down and in a postion where we can't get up without making a crowd. LOGIC."
"1096","the longest i've had a lockdown drill was 30 minutes"
"1097","Take notes white boys so you know what there plans are"
"1098","Okay, guys their is a school shooter everyone clump together in a corner so it is easy for him to shoot us."
"1099","We practiced our lockdown drill last month and my classmates were laughing and talking all loud. I was like if this was real we would be the first ones found"
"1100","According to the NRA, arming everyone will help. As if kids and emotional people will be able to shoot the gunman."
"1101","when I was little right I just arrived at school and straight away there was a lockdown but luckily we got there bc they had to shut the entrance gate. I had to wait in the office until I.could go back to class. only in nz"
"1102","why wasnt  day damn doors locked ⁉ dafuk"
"1103","damn holly got a body on her"
"1104","I get anxiety from drills so stuff like what you were showing at the ends scares me and I hope our school never does that cause I would be no help having an anxiety attack while a shooter was near."
"1105","i cried because this happend to me 2 times"
"1106","does anybody even know that we may have a earthquake"
"1107","we do all this shit in a drill 
if it were the real thing i would place desk all over the door 
and if he were to get in he's going to get met by a hail of chairs"
"1108","paintball lol"
"1109","I like it when the news  channels don't have CC which they might said something valuable. I'm sure I can understand people all the time, talking fast, talking slow, different accents, and whatever makes them uneasy to listen.

Those above are sarcasm, btw.

"1110","All desks should have firearms locked up in a safe only accessible through the front office fail safe key. Once the key is turned, the desk safes unveil the weapons for all trained teachers during a school shooting."
"1111","Or just act normal and when the shooter sees you say ""what's up my nigga"""
"1112","2:18 that teacher is beautiful"
"1113","The only problem is... the shooter will be one of the kids and will know about the drill."
"1114","Propaganda to disarm the population. Funny how people were always armed yet this is a modern phenomenon (without even going into the possibility that some events are faked)."
"1115","lol they threw dog toys at him"
"1116","Lol , who the fuck take drills seriously?"
"1117","Ive been playing uncharted since I was 12 so I have 4 years of experience."
"1118","our first drill happened yesterday, but we didn't know that it was a drill. i played dead, and they thought i had a heart attack"
"1119","They are teaching to teachers, nothing makes sense anymore."
"1120","My school did this, except we had the option to run, or barricade the door, grab a weapon, and fight back. These drills are important. Every cop I've spoken with says we need these drills."
"1121","Hahaha I had one today"
"1122","My High School lockdown drill is sort of like this. Nobody screams or fires blanks at us, but sometimes security will rattle the doorknob."
"1123","Wait if the doors are locked then how does he just go in and open the door?"
"1124","and also everyone knows how lockdown goes so there is no point in being terribly quiet and pretending were not there their not idiots they know schools in session and that there are children there so..."
"1125","look at our school they go on the thing and say lockdown drill we turn off the lights close the door and wait for like 5 minutes then they come back on and say the drill is finished we do t have police come and some guy shooting a fake gun at us. not      ok"
"1126","get you one who can do both"
"1127","*grabs a pair of scissor and kills someone* I'm new here sorry I.I"
"1128","Lol why do you guys sit in the corner,  we learned how to open the window and leave to a safe spot"
"1129","Hi there! Freshly-graduated student here from Ohio who was present through an active shooter experience, and I have to say something:

LOCKDOWN DRILLS ARE WORTHLESS. The shooters knew how the drills worked. Stop teaching us 'kids' to hide and start teaching us how to defend ourselves. If my younger siblings ever have to live through an active shooter, I do not want them to die."
"1130","Bruh, nigga with the gun gonna get in the room and start shootin' these lil motherfuckers thinks they can beat a some strong guy with a gun, men this is fucking messed up, the shooter could just get in the room and start shooting before anyone do anything, And who the fuck would sit against the wall? If i were in a real lockdown i would not give a fuck what the teacher would say I'd just do what i would do to save my life."
"1131","The way the girl took down the guy his gun was in the air and they did a 360 where he could of shot a lot of times"
"1132","Surely, grade-level chairs should have training and secure access to a weapon for real student-protection. Also, kids should be able to pray out loud!!!!!"
"1133","Sadly, we've come so far from drills of yesteryear...Clearly, those teachers would cause more harm trying to physically combat an adrenaline-hyped shooter. I suppose it becomes gut-instinct; but, let's tell the truth and shame the devil, MOST women are not physically able to overthrow a man. Clearly, morning prayers in schools needed, and 100K minimum salary should be starting pay for teachers."
"1134","Instead of all this why don't they just ban guns. Like if kinder eggs are banned cus they are dangerous yet it is perfectly fine to have a gun then that's just fucked up"
"1135","why are the doors not locked? That could easily help so down the situation"
"1136","lol this country is so fucked up - ""school shooting drill"" are you serious"
"1137","I think it's stupid that they lock down even high schools they should let them go home cause the shooter can easily shoot a classroom from a door even if the halls are empty it's pretty obvious where the students are"
"1138","Columbine part 2 coming soon 
Lol"
"1139","In my school, they wouldn't hire anyone to pretend, there was just the principle congratulating us for not speaking, but seriously, they really were speaking, farting, and laughing like a bunch of babies, and I had to experience such a thing. And it was announced, everyone knew it was fake."
"1140","I'm going to Columbine next year"
"1141","I don't give a crap what the teacher thinks. I'm hiding in the dang cubbies."
"1142","My school thinks that sitting in a corner in the dark is keeping us safe but it makes it even worse because if it is real we would be cornered and also we should have self defense in gym class in case for this stuff"
"1143","The dude wasn't even fighting back she exposed her face and gave the dude an open hand all he would've had to do was punch her a couple of times then boom their goes a class room full of kids"
"1144","Don't u think the school shooter might be one of the students"
"1145","I've never done this in ANY of my schools until the 9th grade and when the principal said ""we're on lockdown"" (just a drill) I jumped out of the window 😭😂 I was suspended"
"1146","damn this would be cool"
"1147","So scared of school shootings"
"1148","1st off what guy would want to kill a bunch of kids? like really what do you gain from that? you dont know them the only way i can see this happen is if they guy is crazy. or what my school say like if a robbery happens, why would a robber go to a school to hide? the likely hoids is very low. now a kid shooting up the school, if they are whit there is a 100% chance they will"
"1149","We don't do that we just hide in a corner"
"1150","Our school does teacher drills with volunteer kids with fake blood but none during school days."
"1151","lol my school IS LRGIT 90% WINDOWS"
"1152","fucking sad you have to have a drill like this in america, such a fucked country, fix your gun laws and thus the problem"
"1153","I wish this was my teacher she Strong"
"1154","Alright so I was in my music class and we had a lockdown room. And I I thought it was real cuz it lasted like 45 minutes. we heard a really loud sound of a door opening and I grabbed a violen. It was a teacher and i almost smashed her face in, she deserved it though cuz she didn't tell us that the drill ended until a while"
"1155","I'm proud to say that in the real world; in the modern world; in 2016, we don't need school children to have to drill for this shit. Only Americans think school massacres are part of life, and I am proud of not being an American. Where I live, children are more important than guns."
"1156","I'm glad a school is doing a drill like this, my school doesn't do this shit and I'm never terrified. when I was in 4th grade we had a lock down because of some guy threatening police down the road, though the school said it was a drill. so me knowing what a drill is, was not scared at all. and the kids in the beginning of the video did the right thing if a school shooting were to ACTUALLY happen."
"1157","The shootings happen because none of the adults or staff in the school have a means of killing the shooter,  before anything happens.  If the teachers don't have any means of detaining or killing the shooter and they rely on the police to stop the shooter,  the kids are going to be dead before the police arrive since they can't just teleport to the school,  and they also probably wouldn't know where the shooter is.  Also how are the police going to be notified of more info than just ""there is a shooter at this school"" that will also be a problem because what if it is a large school. So consider that the next time you you vote against guns"
"1158","Bruh if you announce on the goddamn loudspeaker that there's a lockdown in progress the shooter would know. And find a way to find everyone and kill them. However if you say something like teachers bring the red binders to the main office, it would be a little less obvious and would buy you more time to move students to a more concealed area. I'm not saying the shooter wouldn't EVER realize that it is a code for students to hide but at first the shooter wouldn't be aware that students would be hiding and they would have more time to get to better hiding place"
"1159","at my school we just sir in the chairs"
"1160","*Turns offs lights and hides behind desk*
Killer: FUCK I can't kill them now because the lights are off!"
"1161","Land of the free ,what a load of shit , America is a very sad place ."
"1162","0:45 
My school doesn't say Tobacco Free😂 is that normal😂"
"1163","Actually it would be kind of fun to play dead in the Hallway (in a drill don't get me wrong) I want to scare someone during a drill but who would be in the halls except maybe a few people"
"1164","I think they should have this on every school"
"1165","Wait wait wait, let me get this straight...So America is so messed up that it requires a drill for SHOOTINGS, AND the fact that there way of dealing with it is about as useful a an ashtray on a fucking motorbike! I mean WHAT THE FUCK is cramming all the kids into 1 corner, for 1 bullet to go through the front kid and hit all the kids bunched behind him meaning a full mag is enough to wipe out a whole class within 30 seconds! Can i just say im no genius or anything, but wouldnt the LOGICAL thing to have is a large window that opens like a fire window/escape? Surely if the damn shooter is walking the corridors having the ""Lockdown"" alarm go off and the teachers open the evacuation window for all the kids in each class to run out to safety wouldnt that be the best fucking option. For fuck sale this is ridiculous!"
"1166","Here's the thing that concerns me we just lock the door close the windows turn off the lights and be quiet any gunman can shoot through the doors and just full on shoot someone they need to teach more things to do if this does happen"
"1167","I love how everyone is quite during lockdown drills, shit in our school we say killer keemstar is coming or do fart noises"
"1168","these fucking eugenes"
"1169","I'm 15 and 6,5 and I weigh 230pds whenever something about a school shooter is mentioned everyone in my class thinks I'm Superman or some shit and I can stop bullets"
"1170","getting in a group is so much easier to take out more people at one time schools are dumb asf"
"1171","Goddam holly is thicc af"
"1172","Our teachers tell us if there's an active shooter to stab them repeatedly with a pencil"
"1173","seriously though what messed up person would go to a school and shoot a bunch of kids. Is grab some scissors to be honest."
"1174","She had a flashback"
"1175","fuck you i hope i get shot."
"1176","What sucks is that there are wayyyy too many guns to even take away anymore. And then there would be an increase in illegally imported guns from offshore locations. Shootings go down but crimes go up. I mean, I guess it'd work because kids are safer than older people now. And that's what matters right? The kids? I don't know its all complicated."
"1177","School shootings are funny af"
"1178","There was a legit lockdown at my school but I was upset I didn't get to play on the computer.
Another time I didn't know it was a drill so I grabbed my computer and opened the door to the outside in my teacher's classroom and ran only to find out it was a drill."
"1179","U can't run from bullets"
"1180","Honestly what if the shooter had a knife or a second gun like Eric and Dylan had 6 guns with them"
"1181","5:45 she would have been shot so fast in a real life scenario. Also, I've always been told by teachers that if possible DON'T put anything over the Windows because that makes it blatantly obvious that you're in the room."
"1182","I remember once my school had an unannounced drill. The principals announced over the over com the secret message to let's students and teacher know there is an intruder. So my teacher locked the door and turned off the lights. Then started checking her phone and I was like what are you doing and she was like the principle. (Forgot her name) usually texts me if it's a drill and I do t have a text. So all the kids and me started flipping our shut. And then we see through the window in the classroom door that the hallway lights turned off. Then we heard gunshots and someone running through the halls then someone rattled the door knob. I was crying so freaking hard. And then boom. My teacher is like it's just a drill. And the principal walked in and was like I hope everyone did. What they were supposed to do. And I'm sitting at my desk all puffy eyes like wtf????+?"
"1183","gg"
"1184","Aah America 😅"
"1185","Yet another reason why guns should be banned in America.. Thank god I live in the the UK"
"1186","My school sits in a corner."
"1187","5:50 was good expect bullets are flying every were"
"1188","at my school they BANG! on the portables! and literally YANK! on the door handles like nearly rip them OF!"
"1189","white people lol"
"1190","What if it's a student shooter won't they know where people are?"
"1191","Tennis ball? BOI REALLY"
"1192","and also to the parents of these kids, would you rather your kids be terrified and cautious about these drills or dead"
"1193","Once a dude in my gym class was going to the bathroom and he saw a empty box of 12 Guage bullets in the trash can.....................O_O"
"1194","Do the kids know it's a drill?"
"1195","I remember when I was back elementary school in the 5th grade we an actual lockdown cause someone was on campus trespassing and I was scared to death cause I had to under my desk and I started praying to God saying I don't want this person to come into the classroom."
"1196","We never had shooter drills when i was in shool, it's sad that it's getting this bad."
"1197","i wish my school was like this id be able to LIVE and not get shot in the head or in call of duty HEADSHOT +10"
"1198","Give the teachers weapons or tasers or something. if the shooter comes in then the teacher can just kill them."
"1199","Well at least if my school in the UK has an attack I know what I ought to do. Although I'd probably have something to throw with me just in case ._."
"1200","those kids are amazing and good for being quiet"
"1201","My school never had a real shooter or a fire"
"1202","Why throw tennis balls"
"1203","My school just says we are practicing and we all get in the corner for 5 minutes and that's it"
"1204","My school just says we are practicing and we all get in the corner for 5 minutes and that's it"
"1205","Awesome tactic, we need this , give people the tools they need to potentially save lives .. I can't believe there is any opposition to this- those who do are clearly ignorant and deserve to be in a shooting without anyone knowing what to do, then see how they feel about educating teachers/etc. In self defense/disarming"
"1206","whats up with america and shootings lol..."
"1207","The teacher training when they fight back looks like 2 people making out lol"
"1208","I got a collateral on the kids in the corner with my mp7."
"1209","I feel bad for the guy pretending to be a shooter 😂"
"1210","its sad that schools have come to preparing kids for possible death when all they go to school for is to learn"
"1211","lol i'd be dead, try this shit in high school nobody gives a flying fuck drill or not, usually your supposed to keep quiet but in fucking high school no fucks given people on their phones, talking, yelling n shit"
"1212","The columbine graduate would have her kids fucking using pencils to stuff it up that nose of the gunner"
"1213","the kids at my school when were in lockdown they would just fart and laugh like it's a joke honestly I don't care if  I get in trouble next time I'mma throw them in the hallway with the shooter"
"1214","That's why you gotta sack them with a fire extinguisher. DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO!!"
"1215","My campus is an open Campus in SouthernCalifornia so instead of having a lockdown we run ""off"" campus aka go to the options of 10-15 gates and stand there...so if it actually happened we would run and leave school"
"1216","White kids with them choppas sprayin"
"1217","White people lolz"
"1218","If this happens to me, I'll text my mom I'll always love her forever. If I was about to get shot, I'll say my final words to my friends. If I didn't get shot, I'll cry and text my mom I'm fine. My mascara would run and when I get home, I'll rush and cry to my mom and her too. I'm crying right now."
"1219","Yo, you caught me man. It's just a prank. The camera is over there"
"1220","this does not happen in Australia"
"1221","Florida, yeah."
"1222","Alright kids,everybody line up in the corner,school shooters are like t-rexes,they only sense movement"
"1223","Or...
Run? emergency windows are a thing.
Fucking jump the guy? Really it's not that hard with atleast 20+ per class room, even if they're like 14-16 years old.

Or even better, How about we arm teachers? It'll never happen, because democrats are a bunch of pussified morons, but it would work at least if the situation arises."
"1224","I know some wouldn't agree but I think this is a really amazing idea that should be done in all schools. Especially when being taught how to defend ourselves when it comes down to it."
"1225","Watching this, I have to wonder if it does any good. I don't know the answer to that.
When I was in school, we did the nuclear attack drills, but while we all dutifully followed what we were supposed to do, no one took it seriously.
MY kids do the active shooter lock down exercises each year here in Canada, but from what their teachers have told me, they don;t really see them as making much of an impact. They know they are coming, so the students don't take it seriously. 

The most recent threat was a bomb scare, and all the kids left the buildings all across the province, but yet again, the drills they did in the past didn't do much except reinforce common sense action. 

I'm not saying these drills don;t help, but I am wondering if they do. Maybe someone who has been in an active shooter situation and experienced this can answer that for me."
"1226","lesson of the day bring a knife"
"1227","Am I the only smartass that would just go out the escape window, especially the first floor window(Second Floor I might be screwed xD) & not ""hide"" against the wall?"
"1228","Look at it this way. if you have a full class of kids sitting there and a shooter comes in, they are all probably going to die, but if they barricade the room and fight back you could save at least 7/8 of that class. would you rather have an entire class dead or lose on life and the rest live to see a better day. on top of that there are windows to break and jump out of, especially if you are on a first floor. another thing is trying to keep the school informed via intercom systems. if everyone is in the dark about the shooters location it will cause more panic. but if there is communication people can be prepared. and even if someone says all clear, you can never be sure that it's not the shooter talking. so I fully support this training and I believe this is how lock down drills should be executed to train the next generation in case a tragedy ever happens."
"1229","The maneuver in 3:50 looks usefull to stop the gunmen aiming at children

But what if the gunmen are lefties?"
"1230","Am I the only one who doesn't feel scared during lockdowns? Everyone else seems to shit their pants when it happens."
"1231","At my school they teach us to barricade the door if shooter is close and to look for anything that we could use to harm the shooter. Good thing half of my teachers used to be in the military or used to be police officers"
"1232","5:16 yo that teacher is dumb as fuck dude..."
"1233","Do a surprise attack throw tennis ball and lacrosse and pin him down if you losing yell for help and they will tackle him and get you choice jail him or kill him (type of Warent like a cereal killer like most wanted you might have to I think?"
"1234","Tip: if a killer is behind you runway outside if you close with knife and 2 feet behind the killer pick up the knife and stab him to death if shotgun kill him sorry I so humor and sorry parents and teachers I said that"
"1235","1:19 why would a dumbass dad race to the school he could of died if the active shooter saw him???"
"1236","maybe danger is what it takes to protect people"
"1237","This is why I make white friends.  lmaoo"
"1238","there are shooting drills in America?"
"1239","If my school had a shooter in it, I'd jump out the window"
"1240","We found out in a drill that our lock was broke and the head of the school came in, he looked around he ask where we were because he didn't see where we was hiding, he thought it was just our teacher in our room"
"1241","we had a school shooting at my school in elementry it took 3 hours to be quiet and hide under our desk my scariest moment"
"1242","soo unsafe! how can they be so stupid, barricade the door! don't just lock it! this is why shootings are happening in school, either 12 year old or any kid on the cell texting making loud noise, or just the teacher fucking doesn't know how to do anything!"
"1243","this is great"
"1244","ever noticed that kid waving on 00:49"
"1245","Im so lucky I live in a country i dont have to worry about this !"
"1246","WHEN I WAS IN KINDERGARDEN THERE WAS A REAL LOCKDOWN BUT EVRYONE WAS OK"
"1247","My classmates are never quiet. One time they announced that they were going under lock down but the teachers didn't know anything about a drill...we went to hide in the corner and my classmates were chatting *loudly* among them selfs. May I mention that our school is so small that you could look down two hallways and see the whole high school building. We already have that problem and I don't want to get shot because they can't keep there mouths shut...and we also don't have shades to over the windows...and at one point are teacher just shut the door and turned off the lights telling us to stay in our seats...I was in clear view of the hallways window...and during a tornado drill the safe room door was locked for a good five minutes...and we were in the breeze way which was made of glass...are school is just trying to get ride of us I swear, because they told the teachers to go first into the safe room."
"1248","Wtf why are they posting this on YouTube the Shooters gonna know the drill now"
"1249","It's called locking doors. And in real ones can't you put small desks against them as soon as it's announced?"
"1250","Someone brought a BB gun to my school today....
The news said there weren't any threats but he pointed it at my friend..."
"1251","My LOCKDOWN the police come and jiggle the door knob and shine a flashlight during the drills  and we keep the doors locked at all times and since we do we have a secret knock so we know it's a student or staff"
"1252","in danger a lot"
"1253","in danger  a lot"
"1254","Run away waiting for death isn't an option"
"1255","YYou really want to practice, DONT say its a drill."
"1256","they should rko the shoters"
"1257","My school doesn't do lockdown drills, which is useful......"
"1258","When I went to school in Colorado they did not do that yet"
"1259","@1:30; leave it up to the cops to screw everything up. aka-Oklahoma,North Carolina,and so on..."
"1260","it's so sad that our kids have to practice anything like this. I never would have imagined this when I was an elementary student."
"1261","In my school the rooms are made so theres a certain area where you cannot see through the door"
"1262","We have practice drills once a month"
"1263","It's sad that school shooting drills are now as common as fire drills what the hell happen to humanity"
"1264","I'd fuck the hell out of her"
"1265","Eh.  In the reenactment where the cameraman mentioned fighting back.  The guy with the gun would use his free hand and beat the bitch instead of twirling around on the floor.  So their simulated ""fighting back"" is invalid."
"1266","are you kidding me? so the 5ft female teacher just going to walk up to a school shooter and take his ass out, whilst hes carrying a fcking assault rifle, SURE good luck lmao"
"1267","The kids will just go crazy and attack the intruder oh yeah that's me I'll go crazy just to get my classmates to safety"
"1268","At my school no one ever shuts up during lockdown drills so I think drills like this are mandatory but the parents and teachers should be told in advance"
"1269","Lol my husband almost got a ticket nah Fuk da kids I don't want to pay dis spending ticket"
"1270","We don't do drills because it's 4th grade to 12th grade in the school I go to. We don't do it because we don't wanna scared the little kids."
"1271","I for sure think that they will think it's fake and not react lol"
"1272","That is a damn shame. I have no understanding of such madness and inherent evil. God bless our children,our schools,the faculty and staff,our Military, Armed Forces, Law Enforcement,Security Systems on all levels. In Jesus' Name. Hallelujah. Be safe and blessed. Amen. Love and Peace~gYpsY"
"1273","Yeah sure, attack someone with a gun who is going to walk in through the door, and expect he does a certain action. for all, we know the gunman could avoid getting his arm restrained and just shoot down the teacher who tried to attack him  if she misses."
"1274","America dug themselves into a hole where, even if they wanted to get rid of guns, they can't. Everyone and their grandmother owns a gun in the States and now it's reached epidemic levels where kids are taught how to avoid being shot at while in school. Now, even the idea of gun control to your average American is tantamount to removing your nutsack. Lighten up, gun nuts, nobody is gonna take your guns away because there's not really any point. Too late. Now, the rest of the world watches as a tremendously civilized nation is being hit with a wave after wave of gun related massacres. Enjoy your guns, you delusional fucks!"
"1275","The reporter's being a dick. Better to have some basic training from professionals than none at all. A lot of killers could have been stopped if someone had confidence and/or relevant knowledge, this will save lives."
"1276","so we had a lock down drill last week and I was in history and I swear no one shuts up . The kids were laughing so loud and the teacher left the projector on for most of the drill all I thought was if this was real we would have died ."
"1277","Fuck that, hiding in a corner won't do shit. It will just get you killed quicker

If that happens I'm jumping out the fucking window. I rather have broken bones than being killed on the spot doing nothing to save yourself."
"1278","Obviously those teenagers did the wrong thing messaging their parents saying ""Oh yea their are police here with live guns, its a drill but I wont tell you that because it builds suspense. If your worried for me please file a report to the school, because i love to be in tbe middle of drama."""
"1279","Lol I feel like the dude just kept choosing Holly for everything because she was from columbine. I'm not saying hes a dickhead for it or anything  but ya know like... dude, calm down."
"1280","this was awesome"
"1281","I had a lockdown for a wild dog before.... soooooo"
"1282","isnt it illegal to fake that? smh i honestly do not like america at all"
"1283","I'm in full support of this idea, it's scary but, it's good for em"
"1284","My school had a shooting threat today"
"1285","I've never seen ABC report on the thousands of incidents where innocent people defended themselves and their loved ones with guns."
"1286","we had a lockdown at our school and my teacher trusted me to help her take and intruder down if he ever came in our room ( we are distracting the shooter so everyone can run out the back door) so this 200 lbs man kicked the door down and in my mind i was like holy shit! i lunged at that guy so fast he made a crack in the wall i grabed his gun and put it to his head. then he tried to push me out of the way and i punched his face. he actually started crying calling for his mom say i want my mommy. i was standing there with that guy pressed against a wall for 20 minutes before the cops arrived. i didnt notice but when i lunged at him he had a knive in his hand and he was able to get a blow on my right side of my torso. i was bleeding more than i thought a stab wound could do. fortunately im alive 

and yes im a girl and i did all that B)"
"1287","I just had a test of the intruder alert system OMG"
"1288","Fine you want to recommend something to me this dumb, I'll respond. I don't cower in a room, I attack, cause any douche that goes into a school to shoot it up because his vagina hurts when he found out he isn't actually special like he has been told his whole life, that the world isn't fair. I attack and kill the douche."
"1289","""It was just a drill bro"""
"1290","LOOK I  KNOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE VERY SERIOUS BUT AT  3:50  IT JUST PLAIN KILLED ME LOL"
"1291","Only in the US of A :)"
"1292","So in the US I'm pretty sure you're supposed to have one of these at least once a school year and I've never had one in my life and I'm a freshman"
"1293","True.  Srsly, I fell like we'd all die"
"1294","Rainstorm Appledash ikr they are just like that at my school"

"1297","wow. they need this here at Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins Colorado"
"1298","At my school, we figure out a way to move farther from the threat than having the threat come to us."
"1299","you hope.......YOU HOPE?????? I get that you need to be ready but come on!!!!
'We hope they are getting used to the idea' You are so stupid, kids and anyone in schools shouldn't have to get used to those kind of things. DONT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU IDIOTS!?!?!?!?!?!? Schools and a lot of the teachers there are just trash now. Thank goodness I'm HomeSchooled, your probably thinking, oh well you should love everyone then right? WELL, i can rage if i want to!!! I do want y'all to go to heaven but sometimes you just go to HELL TO BURN WITH THE DEVIL!!!!! Yes i might get a lot of haters but i don't fricken care anymore. Im done with you idiots, you think christens are just SO nice, well were not ALL the time. I have a good feeling the world is going to end soon, I'm thinking sometime after the election or even the next election, you  all know were getting the Idiot chick. YOU VOTED for HER, when that SHE DEVIL makes thing bad, its all on you. YOU VOTED, YOU IDIOT. I'm DONE, frick off"
"1300","I'm pretty pissed because if a shooter comes into the school. There would be somebody telling people to lock down. The shooter could hear and the only thing students could do is get rained on by bullets because they're stupidly sitting in a cluster."
"1301","if fuck the shit outta ms carpenter😈😈😈💯😏"
"1302","training is better than no training."
"1303","We do the same thing in our school , it's just that we have a special code word , and we hide in the closet instead of hiding under or behind our desks"
"1304","What's the point of speeding to get there? It's not like police would let you in to stop the shooter."
"1305","Also you could have killed the people getting him down by accident"
"1306","Putting everyone in a corner makes it to easy to kill everyone so I will hide in the corner near the door"
"1307","Lol my friends go their"
"1308","in real life its more risky they could be stronger than you think they might have a ak47 or anykind of gun they might use so you got to be smarter maybe if you lock the students underground or a secret spot and have a highly trained teacher with a bulletproof suit because they could do anything or shoot a bullet right on you before you know a bullet is 2,500 MPH so if you shoot it its too late to stop it from hitting anyone or anything and they will be very sneaky and try to break in if you see them try to run very fast and warn the kids but don't yell they could be following you. sorry if i'm making it more seem risky but i'm just saying what might happen in real life. or maybe get a shocking fences and try to defend the school as possible."
"1309","I live in Southern California and we do this drill once a year. Kids from the drama program dress up and play ""dead"" and it's usually actually kind of fun... but this is extreme. 😳 I agree that teachers should be prepared in voluntary training such as ones shown, but these are just kids! Should we really be scaring them with weapons and police men?!"
"1310","shooters are more likley to go in a dark silent room cuz there not stupid"
"1311","This scares me because i have like anxiety and always worry about the what if's and so just the thought of like school is supposed to be one of the most safe places and the possibility of being shot in one of the most safe places scares the crap out of me"
"1312","We don't do lock downs only fire drills"
"1313","that's so weird I'm watching this and I had a lock down drill not real one today,"
"1314","if there is ever a man that is a school shooter then I would kick that guy in the nuts with all my strength"
"1315","if there is ever a man that is a school shooter then I would kick that guy in the nuts with all my strength"
"1316","I was so proud of that teacher who graduated from the columbine high school for taking that guy down that's amazing (:"
"1317","""we hope the kids are getting used to the idea (of a school shooting), we have to"" that is..the saddest, scariest thing I have ever heard"
"1318","been doing this shit for like 3 years :/"
"1319","The teachers should have guns"
"1320","This reminds me of the one Office episode where Dwight tried to do a fire safety drill by actually starts a fire"
"1321","I'd be excited as fuck."
"1322","So the drill is to round all the students up in a corner. And hide behind the door lock. And not give teachers a concealed  weapon and training.

Yeah that lock on the door and that wooden desk will keep them safe."
"1323","ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS BETTER RUN BETTER RUN FASTER THAN MY BULLET"
"1324","This is stupid. Most shooters bring more than 1 gun"
"1325","if my school had a code red and that person came in we all would charge at him/her with chairs"
"1326","This just scares the crap out of me."
"1327","I used to have a lockdown and now in 3rd grade I have 4 news ones one is a  shelter down where something is going on or a storm is to hard  where we can't leave the class or building until the sighing comes on I had practice once"
"1328","Dang that's scary"
"1329","Sure, it's easy to disarm him with a one handed weapon
Like a pistol or a submachine gun

But what if he has something like an LMG, or an assault rifle...

You can't just expect him to play fair, and you can't always expect to win either..."
"1330","Am I the only one here who thinks this is a darn good idea?"
"1331","what's wrong with america?"
"1332","Lol this is why we have the rule in my school ""No cell phones while we are on lockdown"""
"1333","Kids won't take it seriously"
"1334","god I hate schools"
"1335","yeah let's put all the kids in 1 spot so the shooter doesn't waste bullets"
"1336","Then you have that one nigga who's laughing"
"1337","Why not just arm the teachers? Or arm the students? Or arm everyone?"
"1338","Shooter: any last words?

Me: My booty itches"
"1339","The teacher said damn"
"1340","Greatest country in the world... If this were another country, Americans would see this video and call their society ""undeveloped"" and ""barbaric."""
"1341","If I heard a shooter in the hallway I would grab my friends and we dippin like bye"
"1342","Glad I don't live in America"
"1343","I'm suprised my school dosnt do this... I live in the south"
"1344","What our school does is when the lock-down happens we hide and in a few minutes the principle tries to act like the bad guy by, trying to open the door, or knocking"
"1345","I think this is a grest idea but are they gonna start doing this at all schools? cuase I don't know if im ok with that I don't want to get fake shot although I might get my teachers to fight back I might be ok with this drill though idk"
"1346","its just a drill bro!"
"1347","Only in America. Where I happen to be at the moment..."
"1348","""Shooting drills"" ... that's the kind of fked-up world we live in now."
"1349","GUNS ARE NOT BAD BUT RETARDS WITH GUNS ARE VERY VERY DANGEROUS......"
"1350","at home"
"1351","Im watching this while a shooting at my school"
"1352","At the end of the day, training is gonna help keep people on they're feet. That's the word we live in."
"1353","also I think it's a greater danger"
"1354","in our school we LOCK THE DOOR and turn light of and hide were there are no windows and that"
"1355","Yes, throw tennis balls and staplers. That'll stop em! Teachers should be able to concealed carry inside schools to protect their students."
"1356","screw this im running when a school shooter comes"
"1357","In my school they say that if we go in lockdown, we have to give our phones to the teacher, to avoid us texting our parents and having them come to the school and get in the way of the police. That said, we VERY rarely do lockdown drills, I haven't even experienced one myself"
"1358","Is my school the only one with 2 police men inside the school (middle school)"
"1359","I support this but srsly lose the dead body's, fake blood, but the attacking them I say HELL YEAH FIGHTING AT SCHOOL"
"1360","Disclaimer: Not trying to cause arguments. I understand that people have the right to bare arms. I think that's fantastic, but logically, do people really need guns to protect themselves if no one even had guns except law enforcement..? People are paranoid and just want control to be able to fend for themselves, but is insecurity and paranoia worth the risk of lives of innocent men, women, and children...? At the end of the day, self-assurance is not worth the price of lives.."
"1361","Put every one in a closed compact area. Ya that's smart."
"1362","I would of cried like a little pussy."
"1363","I mean, practicing childhood education, I would have to say that if drills were hold ever so frequently, a child will not take a serious situation seriously."
"1364","When did school shooting drills become a teachers night out?"
"1365","Anyone else gonna run out an exit as fast as they can if this happened at their school?  I ain't hiding."
"1366","Our teachers tell us to run, barricade the doors, or throw things at the attacker. Probably better than sitting in a corner waiting to get shot"
"1367","In fourth grade, me and my best friend were going down to recess (we were the lunch box kids) and there was a random lockdown drill. We had to hide with kindergarteners for twenty five minutes..."
"1368","We don't do locked we only did it once when prisoner escaped our prison but we got a bomb threat last week"
"1369","Only in America is there a school shooter drill"
"1370","16 years old and i love the news"
"1371","A clusterfuck of stupid."
"1372","Jesus Christ teacher are turning into swat team members this is just as bad as militarized police"
"1373","From 5:50 to 6:25 you see an attacker that is trying to lose. This is nothing but teaching a false sense of security. Best option: the ability to shoot back!"
"1374","so fucking stupid! bunch of pussies I would want my kids to go through this! the more real the better they will act when it happens! if you are told just hide when we say go that's easy but when someone with a gun comes in and starts shooting and your not used to it 100% your kid will freeze because they will be to scared! just notify parents next time this was a great drill!"
"1375","It is a tragedy that school shootings are now considered to be such a 'normal' occurrence that so much is being done to prepare for them...School used to be a place where kids could, in general, feel safe. Now, I'm starting to wonder if that's even true anymore..."
"1376","😅😜😜😮😮😌😌😰😰"
"1377","I understand that these drills are being necessary, because these kids need to be prepared. But it's just so sad that this has to be done."
"1378","waooooo"
"1379","That was amazing"
"1380","My high school got bomb threats before. Also our windows have metal over them so you can't just jump out and run away."
"1381","H"
"1382","One time we had a lockdown drill, they told us it was real, and we were hiding for 45 minutes, but then we were told it was a drill, every one just kinda laughed."
"1383","There's a police station next to my school so F a drill I'm hopping the fence and running straight to the cops"
"1384","if this real happened they would not fight back they will cry"
"1385","That seems kinda fun"
"1386","""just a prank bro!"""
"1387","it's so sad this has to be taught"
"1388","one thing:gun control"
"1389","What a fXcking shame that this has to exist"
"1390","we have so many gangs and black market trade here it's easy to get guns regardless of a gun ban"
"1391","Lets make kinder eggs illegal because more people die from chocking on small toys - like you can't choke on a gun! What if the shooter threw eggs at them!?"
"1392","Leave it to the media to find a sensational negative angle to promote.  If the media cared to research this, they would find cases where teachers have successfully faced down or taken down an active shooter. 

After 35 years in large city law enforcement, and 15 years since Columbine, I applaud the teaching establishment and law enforcement for showing the teachers (and students) that they can and should fight back.

If the choice is to die on your knees or fight back, then fight!  You may win, and even if are injured or killed, you may buy time for others to subdue the shooter or escape."
"1393","One of my teachers has stones in her classroom. If this ever happens we will probably throw the stones at the shooter."
"1394","At my school a couple years backwe had a lockdown drill. But later the older students found out it wasn't a drill"
"1395","Geez, Hillary is trying to disarm America.  This is excessive, don't you think?  Also, that drill was fake as fuck.  Only the stupid Hillary voters would fall for that fake ass drill.  Also, students huddling in the corner of a classroom, while NOT locking/baring the door...  That's a completely useless drill, won't save anyone."
"1396","This shouldn't have to be a problem... (sigh)"
"1397","It's not my rule. I simply stated the reasoning behind it. Nor did I say they didn't have the right, but ask yourself this, Do you want your parents to die because of you, as well as many others who MAY see the text if it's on facebook instagram or other social websites who come running to help? The point of the rule is to not cause a panic and to save more lives."
"1398","That is every parents right and your rule is stupid cunt."
"1399","Yes, so if it's not a drill and you call your parents, you cause them possibly get hurt when they rush over to the school to make sure their kid is safe."
"1400","That way Before you die you cant tell your parents you love them."
"1401","That way if its just a drill like this parents are not given a heart attack."
"1402","Samantha Moreta u can get those open easy"
"1403","Jahzeel Escudero 
My school dosent even hide!"
"1404","Emily R. But my school is very safe, it has a cage outside the window."
"1405","in a real situation, go to a room with windows. If there aren't any windows and a shooter comes in, you have no hop of getting out. Breaking windows and climbing through them is a good evacuation plan"
"1406","if someone comes in my school shooting no ones gathering in a corner for him to rack up kills were waiting at the doors to jump on them when they come in"
"1407","Was I the only one yelling practice with a nerd gun 😡"
"1408","No shut up 😳😳"
"1409","why was this in my recommended? and there was a shooting 2 days ago in a town about 45 minutes away from me, coincidence?"
"1410","When I know a shooter is comin in....I'm bouta grab my pencil and pull out my inner Kung fu skills."
"1411","3:50. Yeah let's make the kids enthusiastic about throwing shit at a shooter."
"1412","My mom (who is a teacher) had to play dead for two hours straight"
"1413","Murica"
"1414","I think every class should have a gun and train the teachers how to shoot to be ready if there was a shooting so they can shoot the attacker"
"1415","I think every class should have a gun and train the teachers how to shoot to be ready if there was a shooting so they can shoot the attacker"
"1416","Why I take karate"
"1417","if ure scared ill bring 🍦🎂🍫🐼to be safe of🔪"
"1418","That guys hand is free, all he needs is a knife to disable her."
"1419","Trump paid YouTube to enforce its rules so he could run his ads alone!"
"1420","We are supposed to have fear or else that's when it gets dangerous"
"1421","Because tennis balls will stop a man with a gun."
"1422","Yea bro cuz the shooter is going to walk in seeing all the doors are locked and think ""Dam school must be closed today"""
"1423","So they all hide in a massive group so that the shooter can gun 'em down easily? GENIUS!

Here's a better idea for a gun drill, give every teacher a gun so when a shooter comes, he's outnumbered 10 to 1."
"1424","why not just have more armed security or armed teachers. this shit is just window dressing"
"1425","And that is why I bring a pocket knife to school"
"1426","Why can't they tell just the parents before."
"1427","Dang I wish my school would train us like this. We get the normal ""Duck and Cover"" crap. I just have no idea how that would actually save us in the case of a real shooting."
"1428","It's better than sitting in the corner of the class, waiting to get shot."
"1429","Locked doors and window shades aren't going to stop a shooter. Those drills are worthless. The best thing you could do in a situation like that is to run for your life."
"1430","ricegum was there ._."
"1431","I'm so glad i live in Canada."
"1432","Bro it's just a drill."
"1433","here's an idea,  why don't we just have better security at the front door instead?"
"1434","Sorry. But it there's a school shooter at my school, I'm jumping out a damn window or run out the back door. Not going to sit and wait to die."
"1435","I am now scared to go to school again Monday"
"1436","make windows big enough to climb through, climb through window, leave, done."
"1437","My husband almost put all the kids into a corner Great, let's show everyone the precautions agree with most of what as he comes in im fighting that bitch."
"1438","Sweetie 130mph won't get you a speeding ticket. On the highway that speed is a felony. On a street or school zone that's years of jail time."
"1439","If your fat wouldn't you jump on the shooter down"
"1440","This is a question for any American with a gun 
Why do you NEED a gun"
"1441","This not an accurate representation of lockdown drills in present day schools. In my school our teacher talks to us before this happens and then the day on the intercom when the principal says ""our school is now in code red stay calm this is just a drill"" everybody just sits down farthest away from the door, locks the door, and stays quiet. Our assistant principal just checks if the door is locked, thats it. Some of the students even laugh when this happens. I think these students just wanted attention and said some stuff even though they didn't know what the were doing. And plus I don't think schools would be stupid enough to bring a fake gun into school, because thats a example of what they want the students to be. Now since this is in florida, guns might taken less seriously, but for the mostpart, 
this is an exaggeration."
"1442","One word: America"
"1443","""We visited Colorado""
It said sky view middle school
Lots of my friends from 5th grade are there

Shit"
"1444","they supposed to lock the door"
"1445","meh  my nerf strongarm will kick there buts"
"1446","at my high school it's a rule to have a book shelf that stands next to the door for this reason, one strong student is suppose to get on top of it just for a fighting chance.why the shooter is distracted the student than jumps on the shooter and bring him down while the teacher kicks the gun away.﻿"
"1447","If I was ever in a school shooting I would worry about my brother he's a hall across from me and I would only cry for fam"
"1448","One kid at my friend's school took down a guy with a gun with a chair😂😂😂"
"1449","They don't lock the doors to their rooms? If they're not gonna lock the doors, there's no point to huddling in the corner. That's just concentrating people to be shot for the shooter......"
"1450","lol"
"1451","this is kinda off topic, but i would fuck the shit out of that teacher from Columbine"
"1452","When I was in high school we had three kinds of lockdowns. Lockdown green, lockdown yellow, and lockdown red. If we are in lockdown green then it means it's just a drill and we just close the shades and continue class. If it's a yellow then it means someone possibly dangerous is outside of the building and we shut and lock the doors and turn the lights off and sit at the wall closest to the door in the corner. If it's red then that means that the person is in the building and take immediate action. The longest I was on lockdown red was 4 hours and then after it was clear we was released from school early. Police were everywhere and you could hear all kinds of commotion outside it was insane."
"1453","in high school I never sat in a corner with everyone else I stood right behind the door just out of the sight because God forbid someone actually came in I'm taking them to the ground and fighting to the end not laying there."
"1454","So what if they just kick open the door and throw in a grenade ready to explode? Shit I'm giving them ideas"
"1455","Props to you for putting this on the news and on the internet so shooters know our attack/duck and cover plan!! We're now all fucked!!! WE'RE GONNA FUCKING DIE YAYYYY!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
"1456","just lock every class room door every day. it's what my school does, except every time you go to the damn bathroom somebody has to get up to open the door"
"1457","I don't see what hiding does. All you gotta do is simply run away into some other place and hope for the best ^-^"
"1458","Because america is stupid"
"1459","What the hell!!!AT OUR SCHOOL ITS MORE SAFER"
"1460","it is nice"
"1461","I've had a real school shooting and my best friend is no longer with me, I'm tearing up now😖"
"1462","THE FUCK IS THIS IF UR TRYING TO NOT MAKE THE SHOOTER KNOW U R HERE DONT GO OVER THE FUCKING INTERCOM"
"1463","another reason to stay strapped at school..."
"1464","hey kids if a guy with a gun shows up to your class throw plastic balls at him"
"1465","The fucking girl should've had a detention. She texted her mom at school."
"1466","We had a lockdown at my school and i dipped i am nt gonna hide ima dip"
"1467","anyone else got those world war 2 flashbacks during this video?"
"1468","yeah I think this is great, a very good idea to train teachers to disarm a shooter, but this nationally broadcasted report is showing potential phsyco shooters exactly the kind of training that they're getting so in essence potential shooters are also getting some training on what to expect l, especially when reloading."
"1469","Best ABC news video on youtube ever. We thought network news videos should be blocked from youtube. Not any more after this post."
"1470","nope in real situation a crazy gun man will shoot what he sees on his path. so basically hiding under the teacher's desk won't help."
"1471","im pretty sure the shooter will punch them in the face"
"1472","Sorry to say but this drill is a death trap (not being arrogant). If i was the teacher I would kick out a window and tell my students to haul ass out! I don't give a damn if its several floors; my behind is right after them!"
"1473","Hero's who don't have a training?

Are you retarded.

I don't know any hero training facilities or universities you can go and get a degree in hero.

Batman didn't do any hero training. He just wanted to make the world a better place.
Because he's the hero our city deserves, but not the one it needs right now. Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight."
"1474","I think those drills should be as real as possible.
Kids should not be scared in those situations but ready and only thru repetition can they become ready for the real thing.


Maybe next time put some gps blocker so the situation doesn't go to the parents or people outside the school."
"1475","So this is a game of hide n seek?"
"1476","Ladies and Gentlemen, America."
"1477","""Trauma"" based mind control programming for the kiddies. Parents willfully give their kids to the globalists for creating programmed undetectable trauma based mind control slaves. Anyone in the know, knows Colorado is a hub for this. Blame only yourself for sending your kids to Rockefeller's NEA programming public schools. Nothing in this world is free. You're kids will be programmed into a trauma anchored slave, being lead into their mystery ""schools."""
"1478","This is downright traumatizing for those kids! Imagine looking back on your elementary experience and thinking, ""yeah, those were great times, regularly pretending a guy with a gun is out to kill us."" What a country..."
"1479","But what if drills like this makes kids used to it and if it really happens then they know it's fake"
"1480","This is likely the dumbest shit I've seen. How about instead we arm the staff and get more than one or two fucking police officers in schools? Instead of training them to scatter and hide like newly hatched baby sea turtles"
"1481","So this is the scourge of the 2nd amendment!  America love theirs guns, even though they are aware that not every man that carries a gun is sane. Society is safer if there are no guns and criminals in the society."
"1482","we never do this at my school"
"1483","My school did one of these after we had a bomb/gun threat last year.  As much as it's nice to know we have a plan, I feel like it would go to crap in the case of a true emergency.  If I was staring down the barrel of a gun, I would at least want a chair or a desk or a pencil to throw at the shooter, something, rather than huddling in a barren closet praying.  The last scene was probably my favorite.  If someone considers shooting up a school and finds students ready to rain down chairs, books, lab equipment or other dangerous items, and find teachers prepared to karate the heck out of them, they'll most likely think twice.  I get that the duck and cover thing has been used for a while, but school shooting rates have gone UP recently.  Maybe arm people instead."
"1484","Colorado has some weird ass people"
"1485","this is the kinda stuff all teachers should know"
"1486","Why don't they all wait next to the door and jump on him when it opens🤔"
"1487","Shooter: Any last words!?

Me: suck my ass"
"1488","I'd raher have everybody grab a pair of scissors and be ready to jump the door"
"1489","We have only one police at my elementary school"
"1490","This is scary but I think they should keep doing this because it will prepare kids for the worst. I know it's harsh but there are some crazy people. But they should warn the parents just not the kids😂"
"1491","I don't know how you're safe if you're behind a desk like someone can shoot the door open and kill everyone"
"1492","Unannounced lockdowns!? How about announcing that it's just a drill. Especially for someone who has anxiety, this could be traumatizing and terrifying. This needs to be done more professionally."
"1493","If i was American and a shooting was in progress i would run the fuck out of school not hide in a fucking class room to be massacred.
Doesn't take much for a gunman that genuinely wants to seriously kill a lot of people to watch this and counter everything they have been taught."
"1494","It was probably even scarier for students who went through nuke drills in the 1950s/1960s. My high school still has its bomb shelter from all those decades ago; it's currently used for storage."
"1495","It's only in America you'll prepare for a school shooting..."
"1496","Don't teach the faculty to fucking wrestle, teach them to shoot in a range!!!!!"
"1497","or how about we let teachers have guns"
"1498","2:14 Oh my god, that teacher is hot"
"1499","We have an orange bucket in our school with a crowbar and pepper spray along with a taser"
"1500","My school has drills like that, except we don't have an actor to traumatise us, we just do what we would do if someone was there. We'd probably laugh though if an actor did that kind if thing."
"1501","i would have fainted even if it wss just a dril"
"1502","We once of these and my geography teacher gave the guys concussion after hitting him with a chair"
"1503","Glad I'm not American"
"1504","this is like hell"
"1505","My JR High had a very real lockdown when I was in school. Apparently someone had called the school saying they had a gun and would be setting off a bomb on campus. At the time, I was in a lecture hall type classroom that took up the top 2 levels on the end of the school so there was a fire exit at the top end that led outside. But since it was 2 levels, there were also 2 doors to enter the classroom; 1 from each level. Our teacher had us under the metal desks at first, but when he realized that wouldn't help if someone actually got into our room, he had us all sit on the steps in front of the emergency exit that was directly across from the 2nd lvl door. He told us, a bunch of terrified 14 year olds, that if ANYONE opened either of the two doors to the classroom, that he wanted us to run out the door, go all the way down to the outside door, and don't stop running until we reached the main road. He then told us not to wait for him, we would take on whoever walked in himself. Mr Burke❤️"
"1506","Nah have ur chair in the air next to the door he walks in you smash his fucking head"
"1507","Lmao especially if you have the advantage of being on the first or second floor."
"1508","Luigi Marroquin that's what I was thinking"
"1509","leafy plz roast me smart"

"1515","In all seriousness just notify schools and send this out to schools and schools only so they can have a plan like this instead of PUTTING IT ON THE FUCKING NEWS"
"1516","I'm so sorry..."

"1522","Part 3- Our school used a coded message warning  that all teacher know when announcing real lockdowns so as not to tip off the person who has a weapon. Despite the fact that it was clear it was not a drill, there were a few teachers (in a school of 1800 students & 140+ faculty members) that ignored the lockdown & continued teaching like nothing was wrong. A few pulled the blinds down (the classrooms are on the inside and hallways on the outside) & locked their doors but continued with lessons. My sisters 7th grade teacher did this but also turned off the lights. She kept her students in their seats & had them read instead of taking cover. Most teachers followed protocol & moved students away from windows/doors, closed blinds & locked doors & waited in silence. Some, like my Math teacher, did more. 1 teacher followed protocol & had his students create a wall with their desks & he moved his large one I from of the door. Another hid her students in an office/closet until the all clear."
"1523","Follow up- after 30+ minutes they lifted the lockdown. The call had come from a neighboring district as a prank. It was the scariest afternoon of my life. My grandmother worked on the ground floor, my cousin was in a classroom on the floor below me and my little sister was in a classroom on the floor above me. The entire time I couldn't stop thinking that no matter where this person was, someone in my family was at risk. My parents had received an automated text from the school district saying that the Jr. High was on lockdown (which meant someone on campus with either a knife, gun, or bomb) and knew all 4 of us were in the building. During the lockdown a series of emails went out to teachers and an announcement was made over the intercom to tell teachers to read them ASAP. They said to make sure students weren't using cellphones to text their families because it would interfere with the police trying to trace the original call."
"1524","So This Is Why The World Needs Guns."
"1525","Or take away guns"
"1526","So they're teaching potential school shooters how their victims will react"
"1527",">Realistic school shooting simulation

>Shooter doesn't swear"
"1528","My school also had a lockdown drill. 
I slept while it happened. It was nice and cozy and dark so it and I was next to a wall so it was a good place to sleep... Probably not a good idea for a real situation XD 
Even tho guns are illegal in my country..."
"1529","My high school did a fake drunk driver crash my junior year. There was blood and ""dead bodies"" all over. Fucked up."
"1530","Once we were doing a lockdown drill and someone farted and we all laughed."
"1531","America is actually fucked"
"1532","Wow what pussies. As if an actual shooter is gonna show any mercy on them. It might be scary but hey thats life. They are preparing the kids in case it actually does happen. And let me tell you in the mind of a shooter they arent thinking ""Ok I dont wanna scare the kids so Im gonna politely knock on the door etc etc."". All they are doing is trying to make it realistic so that if it ever does happen the kid will be prepared and know what to do. Parents get mad at the fact that the school wants their kids to be safe? As if a real shooter is gonna show any mercy. How pathetic these parents are."
"1533","i was walking home with my girlfriend last year and a guy with a switchblade tried mugging us. i grabbed his wrist twisted it so he was facing the other way in incredible pain and he ran like a bitch"
"1534","This is extremely sad. Teachers are making fun and joking over a real life situation. If this program was actually serious, teachers and profs would be taking the matter seriously. Simulating the idea of a shooter running into a class and the teachers knowing about it is just pathetic. Everyone was throwing the tennis balls not to injure the ""shooter"" but because they were simply ""having fun"". Pathetic and teachers should be ashamed of themselves for even laughing and having fun during this simulation."
"1535","huddle in a corner and be sitting ducks?"
"1536","Principal: ""Lockdown, there's a shooter, stay calm.""

Teacher: ""Ok kids, stay cal-""

Me: *Opens window and jumps out then starts running*"

"1542","3:45 wtf was that..."
"1543","fuck that, I'm jumping out a fucking window. Also I have an idea why not get rid of the stupid 2nd amendent and it would stop these sucked up school shootings"
"1544","This isn't going too far though. They just needed to alert the parents.
People are so ignorant and sissified to the point where they think _not fighting_ is better than beating the crap out of someone who's trying to kill them. We need *_all_* schools to have this. It's not about being a hero, it's about being human."
"1545","Or you could just... GET RID OF GUNS. Honestly when is America gonna get it."
"1546","The fact that people in America have drills for this 😂😂"
"1547","Its just a drill bro"
"1548","why not just take your chances and run the fuck away ? The shooter will come to your class eventually and i'm pretty sure you are a pussy and  won't try to fight back -_-"
"1549","What the fuck is locking the door and hiding in the corner gonna do? It's not like bullets can penetrate doors and its not like the gunman would know that the reason the hallways are empty during a school day is because they're all hiding and i bet a gun man couldn't kick open a door either."
"1550","This is how fuck up America is."
"1551","Id be stamping on his head constantly then steal his gun and shoot him"
"1552","I have an idea""................NO FUCKING GUNS WITHOUT A CUNTY FUCKING PERMIT"
"1553","Better teach new generation how to behave and avoid this kind of situations in society"
"1554","only in america..."
"1555","Wow these drills end out with a bang"
"1556","is it just me that would walk around looking for the motherfucker,then when I see him tackle him"
"1557","In Britain we never have school shooters"
"1558","fuck sake these americans are stupid..."
"1559","😂 my high-school advisor (homeroom) teacher during a lockdown let's us all do homework or play games on our laptop. 😂😂😂"
"1560","How do you really stop shootings? Ban guns in America!"
"1561","damn murica is fukd up like rip all the ppl living there. and their culture is cringe tbh"
"1562","Fuck americas gun law bullshit, follow Australia's example and this won't be necessary"
"1563","it's funny that the Parent's have to watch the drill on youtube or the TV because they themselves are not allowed in the school."
"1564","i can understand why they did not told the kids about the drill, but not telling the parents? thats dumb as fuck."
"1565","I dunno what school these guys went to, but mine told us that at least one of the walls in the room was brick, not just drywall. and most of our teachers told us if there was a REAL shooter we should climb up and move the ceiling tiles and stand on the brick wall. 
another teacher told us that in reality that the principle told her to tell us to run. if everyone is running away(breaking windows and shit) we have more of a chance of living. 

but when we have these drills we just turn off the lights and go on with our day."
"1566","the kids are gonna have post traumatic stress syndrome and the school district should probably prepare itself for lawsuits in both the near and distant future."
"1567","Cringe"
"1568","Da fuck is throwing balls at a nigga with a ar gonna do 😂😂😂😂😂"
"1569","Paranoia like this is fueled by the media. the reason these drills exist is because of mass paranoia"
"1570","This is incredibly sad we've come to this."
"1571","twist the arm brake it and call the police"
"1572","Students and teachers should be allowed to carry firearms to school so they can defend themselves."
"1573","God"
"1574","This is the same as duck and cover drills, in a real life situation they are most likely dead if the shooter chooses to open fire. My suggestion is that you RUN as soon as you hear the gun shoots, don't hide, don't try to disarm the shooter, just open the closest window and RUN as fast as you can. (if you are on the upper floors, move quickly but silently to the ground floor to escape)"
"1575","The 220 pounds isn't really fighting back at all smh. In real life a kneel to the body from a man can take out that woman for good. This drill make women think they can overpower man which is nor only stupid but dangerous."
"1576","Police come to my school for lockdown drills They unlock the doors and say ""All Good :)"""
"1577","The fact that they have to do these drills just shows how fucked America is."
"1578","Every time we did this in school, I thought it was such bs. I asked my teacher what we'd do if the shooter shot the lock and came in and I was met with: ""uh........"""
"1579","I wanna cry when I see this"
"1580",":0 :0 :0 woah hope that doesn't happen to me at my school"
"1581","Great, let's show everyone the precautions so the bad guys know exactly what everyone does."
"1582","who found this in their recommendations"
"1583","this should not even have to happen because there shouldn't be school shootings"
"1584","Bitch imma hide in a cupboard n lock myself in."
"1585","Murica!"
"1586","I hate how they just slap this on the internet like shooters won't watch it at all and know what to do and where to find the kids during the shooting like nice way to blow our cover"
"1587","at my school we all used to sit together but that would make it easier for the shooter to kill us all so now we spread

one time we had a lock down drill that was a hour and 30 mins long and some people thought. it was real and started crying -- it was real some creepy guy was trying to break into the highschool and we were in the middle. school!"
"1588","If this comment gets 40likes and 20 comments I will propose to my Girl

"1591","She could have got shot"
"1592","Honestly , if someone was smart enough they would study how lockdowns work at schools and realize they jsut hide and group together for you  just sayinnn..."
"1593","I know how to stop killings. No guns America!"
"1594","trust me if there is a shooter in our school, fuck boys would fucking scream to cause attention to our class room xD"
"1595","what if while your doing a lock position it shoots its gun and hits a student?"
"1596","Lmao this isn't what it's like hahaha. they just shove you in a corner and then take you out"
"1597","it's really sad that us kids have to prepare for a shooting at school because some insane mother fucker wants to kill everybody. We shouldn't have to go through this bro!!!!"
"1598","holy wtf... america is fucked up"
"1599","and here in Ireland the most we have to worry about is walking to school in the rain xD"
"1600","Here in Canada, we don't have these drills, everyone chill af"
"1601","These drills shouldn't even happen. There shouldn't be shootings at all. Simply get rid of the guns"
"1602","My school did this but when the alarm went off I was already two neighborhoods gone"
"1603","i understand why they create this drills but the fake blood and stuff is a bit too excessive"
"1604","The only reason why this is happening to schools, is because guns are legal in America. Countries where guns and weapons are illegal, has never ever had a school shooting."
"1605","I live in Australia so I don't really need this right now"
"1606","The fact that this is neccesary is really troubling Americans..."
"1607","So we prevent columbine by doing the exact same shit that got kids killed at Columbine, how about having teachers pull out a fuckin strap and shoot back?"
"1608","I'm sorry but if a school shooting happened I will literally break the window and save myself and take the snacks from the snack bar and bailout 🏃🖕🏾🖕🏾"
"1609","I'm just so pleased I don't live in the states and have to worry about this kind of thing. You Americans and your obsession with guns just doesn't make sense to everyone else in the western civilised world."
"1610","shit, just imagine a crazy psychopath holding a submachine gun with pipe bombs running at everyone. You'll just run away like hell"
"1611","oo its so scared"

Be a rebel and steal the gun"
"1618","Man, that's how we could've stopped Columbine. Throwing tennis balls at aggravated armed teens set out to kill."
"1619","Gotta be about the most idiotic shit I have ever seen. As a Marine with a few combat deployments I'm telling you this won't work. Better give those teachers guns or count on god to save your child. I suppose it might if the shooter is a complete pussy. And by the way that guy wasn't fighting back at all. Seriously can hardly believe how brain dead folks are about how to deal with a shooter......... YOU SHOOT BACK!!! Any warrior knows you have almost no chance bringing a knife to a gun fight. And this video has little tiny weak chicks trying to take him out bare handed or by throwing random objects. No way my kids will be trained to survive by these brain dead goofballs."

And if they can't get their hands on a gun, they'll use something else as a weapon, a knife, a chainsaw, a shovel! Banning guns isn't gonna help anything."
"1648","Em Ma oh what? People don't do illegal things? Wow."
"1649","Em Ma don't blame it on the gun that's like giving a object human powers a pool doesn't clean it self the gun doesn't just go off someone has to pull the trigger and it is the amendment right that I can own a gun and open carry in certain states I am fully for guns the studies show that the people who buy the gun legally aren't the ones doing the killings it's the people who are not liscened to own the gun.

"1680","How this can even exist is a joke... The only drill I've had in my school is in case there's a fire. And that's how it's supposed to be.. 

There's something fundamentally wrong if children in schools need to practice for a potential school-shooting, how is that not clear for everyone?! The rest of the world see it, but clearly not americans themselves.. 

What would save lives is getting rid of the guns, not learning the kids of to throw chairs and hide in corners. 

I find it utterly pathetic  ""Guns are a part of our culture blah blah"".. Yeah.. Right.. Maybe during your revolutionary war but in the twenty first century?? 

Your gun laws are a joke, change them already???"

"1745","3:11
that sounds like bullshit pageant answer"
"1746","Wait hold on a second. MY SCHOOL COULD DO THIS DRILL ANY TIME AND IM NOT READY."
"1747","""And I'm KINDA scared"" because she can't forget she's a rebellious teenager and can't show too much emotion."
"1748","My school doesn't do this.....they really don't care. Sometimes they do weather drills or something like that but most teachers just lock the door and continue with class when we are supposed to get under the desks and cover our head"
"1749","If you want to get results in a school shooting, make sure that your attack is cordinated. Always have a friend or two to help u cover the exits"
"1750","somebody should show this to birdman we need to be ready for them Eugenes"
"1751","I'm so fucking tired of you fucking moron Europeans(& Canadians & Aussies). Just shut the fuck up already.

Ever since Christopher Columbus, the smartest and bravest people have crossed the Atlantic to pursue greatness here.
That's why we have the mightiest Armed forces the world will ever know. That's why we have the most millionaires and billionaires. That's why there's an American flag planted on the moon.
And that's why we don't give a flying fuck about your irrelevant and meaningless, old world opinions"
"1752","In my school they teach us to throw shit at any mother fucker that comes in.

Or staple the shit out of his arms."
"1753","In my school there is an opening in each of the floor boards covered by carpet so Nobody sees it. It leads to the cellar and then to the outside. Nobody's supposed to know but me and 2 kids stayed after school with a teacher and they announce that someone who didn't belong was there, he lifted the carpet and showed us it and that's how I know they exist."
"1754","Schools should have iron doors that automatically shuts with a remote, local police departments and principles should access to the remote."

"1757","All our windows open from the inside and where on first floor so I just go SKIP R
THAT"
"1758","How about of hiding in the corner and waiting to be shot, you and everyone else charge the fucker and beat the shit outta him/her"
"1759","Why would you do this"
"1760","NOBODY likes the police. 
True terrorists."
"1761","The fact they're holding unannounced drills is stupid as FUCK. Think of this as a boy cried wolf situation. If you continue to do this, over and over the kids become used to it. So if there is ever a real school shooting there, then what deems they will or will not know it's a real situation? What guarantees they will know that an actual school shooter is inside of the building? Not to mention having the kids hide at the back of the room just for the shooter (should there ever be one) to be able to mow them down is stupid. The shooter will hear the speaker system telling the teachers and kids there is a shooter. If the shooter had ever gone to a public school before then they would most likely understand that the kids and teachers are trying their best to hide. 

Boy who cried wolf. This will be a big issue. If I had ever went to a school that does this I would rather have dropped out."
"1762","Idk about you  guys but if there's a person with a gun in my school looking to kill I'm leaving"
"1763","In our school, if we do a lockdown drill our classmate just laugh their ass off."
"1764","How do you create mass hysteria and try to convince the kids and staff that they're under a theft?"
"1765","lol if you take down the dude, he will pull out a fucking knife and fuck you up on the other side"
"1766","The solution is to improve police response times and have properly trained and armed officers at the school itself. There's nothing a student or teacher could possible do to defend from an armed shooter."
"1767","I'd have three 6""0 football players 160+ all and have them ground him and knock the gun out his hand and then I'd grab it out it to his head a yell in a deep ass voice YOU THINK THIS IS A FUCKING GAME BITCH STAY ON THE FUCKING GROUND YOU PUSSY ILL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF YOUR MY BIRCH NOW YOU 1 INCH DICK LITTLE BITCH"
"1768","Most shooters that kill people are affiliated in some way explaining their motives. My biggest concern is why these 
teachers are laughing and cheering on these defense tactics because in a real situation they may not be so lucky
A.K.A the teachers are being taught to use both hands to disarm a gunman when they are really grabbing one arm 
leaving the gunman free arm to hit the teacher senselessly until they release their arm."

"1773","Gonna spicy"
"1774","sitting still and getting shot, also not so great.  if there's twenty of you screaming and rushing the gunman, you have a chance of walking out alive. i'd rather go out running towards the attacker with a chair in my hand backed by my classmates and have them reach him while i die then just do nothing."

"1782","It would sound something more like this... ""Hey you, stop- *shot*"""

"1790","+M.S.B Productions Same"
"1791","AMA with the mentally psychotic kids in my school, we didn't need guns or terrorists! We were our own killers. Guns are too quick anyway, it doesn't make people suffer very long, it's kind of a rip off. My school was known as ""the death school"". We usually forgot the real name of our own school. (so don't ask what school I went to)"
"1792","+AMA Maybe I'm one of those :3"
"1793","+LPS Fall Far They could give rifles to the A+ students."
"1794","Actually I'd appreciate a rifle"
"1795","Right. Literally every school across the US has the same lockdown procedure so if the shooter has been to school in the past 20 years then they know whats going on."
"1796","If I were her I would care about my damn rebellious behavior, I would just text ""OH MY GOD THE POLICE JUST CAME WITH WEAPONS!!!!! IM SO SCARED!!"""

"1799","Dude I'm fucking dying lmao"
"1800","Are you ok"
"1801","Shiv, what would happen is that all of you would be dead within seconds because he would just shoot you. Do you really think the guy isn't gonna shoot you when you coming at him? Also, in what world does a school shooter not carry a AR-15 or such a gun in USA? If they gonna kill, then they gonna kill."
"1802","ever since that last school shooting my school has been surrounded by security"
"1803","If I have growing things I would use sharp pencils and stab the shooter as fast as I could"
"1804","Let me tell you how not accurate this is...."
"1805","My school is right next to my house so kd jump out the window and call 911"
"1806","if i was a teacher during the practice of unarming a shooter, i'd ""swish"" behind them and grab their arm and gun and push my foot on their leg closest to me. yeah"
"1807","We don't do lock downs  in Canada? Should we I'm worried!"
"1808","I think that if the shooter comes in the everyone should just charge and take a way his gun"
"1809","EVERY SCHOOL SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS AT LEAST ONCE. The kids in my classes don't take shit serious and be real loud and I'm just prayin that this shit aint real and I'm coming out alive"
"1810","The title was 'What it's Like Inside a School Shooting Drill' Well i read 'What the Fuck it is like in a school'"
"1811","HOW COULD YOUUU"
"1812","Liberals....."
"1813","What if the teachers were Armed?"
"1814","in kindergarten we acualy got shot up at school i had a fucked up childhood"
"1815","I've only had ONE lockdown for a drill and it was a tornado drill and I live in Pennsylvania....that tells you a lot about my school😂 I only have 2 fire drills every 5 months"
"1816","I'd throw scissors at a school shower fuck that"
"1817","my school does a drill called ALICE and it's a method that stands for alert,lockdown,inform,counter, and evacuate and it's used instead of hiding like sitting ducks we actually throw stuff, evacuate, ect. depending where the shooter is in the school. it's a lot better then just sitting in a classroom pretty much waiting to get killed."
"1818","In my school they tell us to throw our stuff at the shooter, but it's nothing like this lol"
"1819","My school just makes us sit it the dark under our desks without the simulation kind of thing."
"1820","simple why doesn't America just put up high gates with sharped edges surrounding the school and restrict enterance of allowing anyone in the schools."
"1821","The police and the School should get sue. This was stupid, there are other ways to stop a shooter and ways in how to react. Like, the school has no security and video tapes??? This is outrageous."
"1822","My school has two massive gates lol no shooter getting in"
"1823","Lol if the shooter wanted to he could just pull the fire alarm, so everyone runs out in the hallways, Then he could mow kids downs"
"1824","there's always the best way to protect themself, punch in the balls"
"1825","If you don't announce that it is a drill, then kids wont know if it is the real thing if it happens. They may act like its a drill when it isnt."
"1826","They're doing the drill wrong. Grouping everyone together just makes easier targets. People need to be spread out, if possible, to minimize any casualties."
"1827","Columbine Flashbacks."
"1828","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run run run, outrun my gun"
"1829","This happend 4 years ago at my school but it wasn't a drill but I mental kid called the cops I was so scary"
"1830","Yo, you caught me man. It's just a prank"
"1831","they announced it....so idk why they freaked out.... but it was stupid and senseless to use weapons in a drill."
"1832","the kid waving at the camera at 2:50 😂😂"
"1833","130 my ass... he was prolly goin 80"
"1834","Use paintball guns or airsoft"
"1835","This is all bullshit and watching it tells me that your government wants as many of your kids dead as possible, the only safe thing to do if a shooter enters a classroom like that is for all the students to charge with a chair, at the same time, or trow their chairs and then charge with their desk, 2 or 3 may get shot, everyone else in the school is unscaved, this way the government is assuring that your kid is a perfect target and gets shot square in the face by piling them up in a corner right in front of the door

EDIT: also, the students should be positioned around the whole perimeter of the classroom, (none in front of the door so they dont get hit if the attacher shoots the door) that way even if they are not instructed to charge the attacher, they will not make an easy target piled up the way they are in the video, and if they do charge him, they will be coming from all directions, again, making a harder target to hit."
"1836","Dang they take it the next level all my school has to do is sit in the dark for like a minute"
"1837","""Trauma""

They should have seriously considered how this could go wrong before they did it"
"1838","murica tho"
"1839","they need to be realistic, kids don't take it seriously. this is coming from a student"
"1840","funny how there never seem to be school shootings in australia or canada or the uk, only america"
"1841","Teachers should hide BB guns or pellet guns in a cabinet so if someone breaks in, you can give the kids those imo."
"1842","I agree with this whole teaching teachers how to handle gunman I think more schools should do that. But my question is what if the teacher freezes? It's different when you're just practicing but when it's actually happening that's a whole other story. We need to arming our security guards and maybe even start arming our teachers.  Schools need tighter security in my opinion. When I was in school our version of a lockdown was they locked the door. That was it. No getting under a desk or behind anything just lock the door for like a half hour."
"1843","When things guy was fighting back if the trigger was pulled she would got shot about six times for out of the clip"
"1844","If someone came to my school with a gun and came into my class, I'll just get my mates to chuck tennis balls at the shooter and I'll jump on him/her"
"1845","Damn, everyone is always got something against something else!
Hell there's always something against something else!"
"1846","If ever a gunman came to my school. I would haul my ass out of there. I'm not getting behind a freaking desk. I'm running for my life. Also  3:51 Did they just throw plastic balls at that guy? Same if there was a fire. If there's a fire or a gunman run like hell."
"1847","That's what y'all do during drills? All we do are flip the tables and huddle in corners laughing at our stupidity."
"1848","every school should do this at least once. i also agree teachers should carry a gun inside the class."
"1849","They taught us the ALICE method, way safer than ducking in a corner."
"1850","Quick hide under the desk. The shooter can't see us here."
"1851","Ban guns , simple"
"1852","This is why Britain does not have guns"
"1853","I think it's a very good idea to train people and to know what to do in case of an emergency like that"
"1854","in our school, we really don't care"
"1855","My dad always told me he said if some won comes in the school with a gun you jump out the window and take the woods home. My school has an PA announcement when something happens"
"1856","I feel bad for teacher who survived Columbine all of her friend's are dead and having a gun in her face"
"1857","This new comment section is ficking garbage"
"1858","i....dont think this is healthy..for a child to be experiencing,,the way they flinch really scares me...idk"
"1859","Only in America"
"1860","Better not do this at my school or there is a chair going to through a window"
"1861","😌"
"1862","always murica"
"1863","They probably took it this far because no one would take drills seriously"
"1864","The thing is that for students to be locking the door and hiding behind a desk doesn't help with anything. Like at least grab a book and if he's close by use the desks and tables and any furniture to block the door."
"1865","why was this recommended to me when I've never watched something like this"
"1866","FFS America, just ban automatic and semi-automatic guns!!"
"1867","Why don't they take away their guns? That will stop disrupting lesson time"
"1868","Americans, with all due respect: this is insane. Maybe you as insiders do not realise how weird this is! Just stop selling assault weapons like candy."
"1869","In reality those teachers have no chance"
"1870","They said ""sit there and lock the doors so they don't get in on us"" I said ""mannnn fuck that knack the white boy Tf fuck out and try to find a way out"" cuz if u sit there they can still shoot and open the door u got to try to escape at least u were tryin"
"1871","Nigga touch my gang we gon turn this shit to Columbine"
"1872","When u notice a camera man in the corner"
"1873","And here in Britain we only practise fire drills twice a year..."
"1874","If there were a shooter in my school, I'd blast out the window and start running. Ain't no way I'm hiding under a desk that doesn't even make me invisible or bulletproof"
"1875","You fucking americans😂 you actually thinks to ban all guns is a bad idea? What do you think is the reason of all the people getting killed by guns in the US?"
"1876","bruh if i had to clump up with other people and the shooter went in my room ima run out the class lol"
"1877","Hi"
"1878","Or instead of traumatizing kids we could control our own citizens and not go through this"
"1879","Im not listening to some fatass teacher im gettin the fuck out on my own"
"1880","It is absolutely disgusting that these drills even occur. The USA is a fucked up place"
"1881","Lol, or they could just ban guns, like in europe"
"1882","My school had a shooting jail once the teacher told us to hide under the tables it was so fun"
"1883","'No way to prevent this' says the only country where this regularly happens"
"1884","thank fuck Scotland has strict gun laws cause I'd stand no chance ig anything happened."
"1885","Or just ban guns you dumbass"
"1886","the fact that there has to be drills for shooters upsets me."
"1887","So gay"
"1888","Why don't the shooters just pull the fire alarm, make all the students file outside and clean house?"
"1889","Get the hell out of my recommended videos"
"1890","I was in grade two when this happened but like a real ass lockdown was on and my older brothers class (6th grade) were out on the basket ball court near where the lady with the big ass knife was and all these lil 12 year old niggas decide to chuck stones at the bitch lmao 😂"
"1891","I'd jump out the window and fucking run as fast as i could"
"1892","I used to attend a private Christian school and they never told the students to hide, instead the students were the ones in charge of tackling the shooter while the teacher called 911. Say what you will about the views of my old school whether good or bad I still don't know. My parents always told me to hide and that it's better to be called a coward and live then be called a hero and die. My teachers told me the exact opposite that it's better to die a hero then survive as a coward. Like I said before, I still don't know which side/view I stand by more, I think it just depends on the situation. I think in the end no one wants to die, but if we do die, we don't want it to be for nothing. If me dying saves 3 students lives it's worth it to me, but if I die just because I was told by someone else to take action, is that really the right thing to do? Here's an ending psychology strategy that tends to be a common essay topic among psych. majors (yes, I am one): a train is coming and you have the power to change the train's path, on one set of tracks you have a friend or loved one tied to them, on the other set of train tracks you have three strangers, who will you let die or kill? Will your answer be for quantity (kill the ONE loved one and save the THREE strangers) or will your answer be for quality (kill the THREE strangers to save your ONE loved one)"
"1893","oooor, you can get 15-20 kids in the hallway and make 'em run zigzag. Dito sa PH di shooting amin. Bombing."
"1894","2:13 Could she move any slower? Never mind training the children, sort the damn adults out. Before anyone says 'she's doing it like that in order to not invoke more panic', pull the other one! I'm lucky to have had the opportunity to use firearms (I live in the UK) and I know how damn frightening they are. You wouldn't be so calm."
"1895","I am 100% all for the teachers having training. the whole huddled up in one spot leaves more victims/ bigger target."
"1896","oh this is so sad. :("
"1897","Why have they got to have a fake shooter? You can have a fire drill without having to set a fire."
"1898","Thank god I'm in Australia."
"1899","stab a bitch with a pencil then staple his fucking dick or forehead"
"1900","Glad I live in Canada lmao, I mean 150 shootings in 15 years, wtf are wrong with people these days, who would even think about doing such a thing?"
"1901","Same :("
"1902","Mass shooters are not predominantly white. A quick survey of mass shooters of the past 50 years will reveal this. White mass shooters just receive more attention in the media."

"1915","They freaked out because even if it's fake and they knew about it, a weapon pointed at your freaking face is gonna scare you duh."
"1916","+Duarte Silva If they dont know what a gun looks like and that they should avoid a person screaming at them while pointing it at them, there isnt much you can teach them that will keep them alive in a situation like that"
"1917","+Murph Enator also no teacher would keep an airsoft or paintball gun. Maybe a real gun"
"1918","+Murph Enator still I refer back to my reason"
"1919","+NeonClash Productions well, if his/her's face is unprotected."
"1920","Lol that won't hurt him good enough. He or she will get annoyed and keep shooting"
"1921","Excuse me? You lock your doors and turn off the lights or cover up the door window so they CAN'T peak in! Move out of sight so they can't see you. It's proven to SAVE lives."
"1922","trombonista92 agree 100%"
"1923","+koll pvp hmm hundreds of kids or 2 or 3 what would you choose? I know it's sounds bad but id rather a few dead rather then hundreds."
"1924","so its obviously better to order the kids to pile up in a corner , so the attacher can take 3 or 4 shots in their general direction and hit (and possibly kill) at least 8 or 9 kids, witouth even trying, and no, its not a stick at a gunfight, its about 25 sticks at a gunfight, assume the attacher has a pistol like in the video, and the students charge at him as soon has he gets in, how many shots do you think he could get out before getting trampled and unable to tell which way is up or down,? i say 3 or 4, and not even accurately so , I am not saying that charging the attacher is a grate solution, it is simply an INFINETLY better solution then conveniently setting up the class for a mass execution like they are currently doing"
"1925","also they should put all the desk against the doors so nobody can get in"
"1926","Of course I do 😂"
"1927","you do realize the tennis balls were just an exercise to get the students and teachers in the fight mentality, right?  most people sit like stupid sheep and are slaughtered, but if students learn to react and work together to fight the attacker, there's a higher chance of survival for most of the class.  maybe when an actual shooter comes in they'll be throwing textbooks, chairs, and binders.  if you all rush an attacker you can bring him down."
"1928","+Rarest Pepe I was joking because that's what they done in this video"
"1929","Yea cuz you can be real accurate with fucking tennis balls."
"1930","+Xia yeah the teachers at my school probably would hop in and help lol"
"1931","Exactly. Trying to stuff all of the kids in a corner when a gunman is storming the school, just to give the gunman a chance to mow them all down is the stupidest shit ever."

"1976","Lauren Mariano? Sounds just like Laura mariano"
"1977","There was a kid in my high school last year who was actually planning to shoot up the school. Obviously he got arrested cause unlike Columbine our school was quick. Plus he showed a lot of signs. One of them was ""I'm going to shoot up the school"" in dead serious he actually said that ."
"1978","School fire drill: *Announces there is gonna be a shooting* *class walks out in a straight line calm*
Real fire: *class runs out of the class like no tomorrow*"
"1979","Fucking hell Eugene"
"1980","a good idea would be to have bullet proof teachers desks so we can put them up vertically against the door"
"1981","It's actually ridiculous that these kids need drills like this when the problem could so easily be solved by getting rid of guns????"
"1982","I reckon it's a good idea because if a gun man came to kill you and your hiding in a room full of people he wants to kill, everyone in that room will die.
however if the students and teachers understand how to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and others we can combat situations like this. a gunman doesn't expect 30 people are waiting in a barricaded room to take him down.

not everyone has to die, it's your life, your child's life, your sisters life. you wouldn't want to have to live without them, so let's teach them how to protect themselves."
"1983","Wow she was a boss"
"1984","in my school we all just hide in the storage room attached to each class, no acting involved."
"1985","it scares me that they actually have to do this x"
"1986","Holly still would of died before the takedown."
"1987","Yo dats mah Gurl right there!!!! she was punching his hand like crazy i love dat girl"
"1988","""Chill, chill, its just a drill bro. Look at the cameras over there!"""
"1989","Fuck staying in the class I'm going through the window!"
"1990","Here we just have solid doors and in case there ever was a shooting we are supposed to look the door and barricade it"
"1991","that teacher seems so sweet and nice.."
"1992","I support this. Yeah the kids might be scared of it but this is life. Stop trying to protect your kids from real life. At my high school I wish we got training like that. All we do is sit in a classroom and all 20 something of us hide behind a small teachers desk and close the blinds lol."
"1993","Lmao at then end. It's funny he's fighting back but yet still has an opportunity to knock her out / punch her"
"1994","Why do they need drills, every child in America has guns duhhh"
"1995","if i was a teacher and i was allowed weapons this is how it would go

""SHOOTER IN SCHOOL, THIS IS NOT A DRILL"" 

*pulls out minigun from under desk* ""OK STUDENTS BEHIND MY DESK TEACHER GOTTA GO DEAL WITH SOME... UHH... ""PAPER"" WORK..."""
"1996","I really hate lock down drills, even if it's fake I get really scared, and I always feel like I have to fart"
"1997","The kid at 0:52"
"1998","I like how the kids are in the line of sight of the 'shooter' and the teachers are hiding behind the door"
"1999","I had a lockdown practice yesterday, and they didn't give us a warning so we could be sensible, but no parents drove over"
"2000","Wow - what's with all the negative comments?? If there was a shoot in your child's school and they had not had any practice drills or a plan in place you who be going to the media complaining  the school was unprepared !!!  Unfortunately in this day and age schools need to have a plan for these situations . These drills may seem unrealistic and ineffective to you, but It may save a life"
"2001","*runs into classroom with a grenade*"
"2002","how do you prepare them for shoters? YOU BAN ALL GUNS MOFO"
"2003","Makes me happy to be Australian..."
"2004","5:54

The drills are smart, but this immense level of false hope is alarming. He's fucking massive compared to her."
"2005","I live in the uk sooooooooo"
"2006","charlie having too much fun in the comments lol"
"2007","Ever heard of the boy who cried wolf?"
"2008","That's it I'm moving to England."
"2009","xavier chill asf smh"
"2010","we all know damn well teachers aren't gonna do this shit. mine can't even copy papers themselves"
"2011","5 minutes? we have lockdown drills for two class periods so two hours... some aren't drills, they're actual emergencies"
"2012","gotta teach these kids how to snap a neck if in danger"
"2013","lol only in America"
"2014","6:00 dude im sorry, but theres now way shed be able to do that if he was actually trying to kill her"
"2015","well it's good to have a drill...cause when the real deal happens...they will know what to do"
"2016","clumping up like that is how we have so many deaths"
"2017","he was going 130??? jesus christ"
"2018","Why did the kids have there phones during the drill that's why the man got the ticket"
"2019","Oh my gosh this is all fucking useless . I think they should just have an emergency gun . I mean like a teaser gun or some sort of smoke Granada or concussions . I mean that could save at least more than half a students in a class room imo"
"2020","If this ever happened I'd just be sitting there sweating and not knowing what I can do to save myself"
"2021","Fake ass shit"
"2022","People need to stop saying ban guns in the U.S. because it works in other countries. I don't give a fuck if it works in Australia the U.S. isn't Australia."
"2023","I wish I had a school like this 😂 I can get my baseball bat and wack them with it on the nees and hit him on the back so they can be weak but idk if I can do that 😆 c: I enjoy violence tbh."
"2024","school logic=Shooter can see us even though there is  school"
"2025","This is something my dad told me think of some thing that got you really mad  and then let it all out"
"2026","In my high school someone said there best friend was gonna shoot up the high school and shoot a gay kid first turns out the gay kid was in my 4 period I didn't come to school for a week then next Monday 4 period he shot ip the school"
"2027","the thing is drills are very very different and the tension and adrenaline changes its one thing the practice drills but wat about the real ones thats why i think drills are kinda useless like kids today take earthquake drills like ""oh yay we waste class time"" but as in a real one happens then look what might happen."
"2028","Why do they stay in the corner what if the gunman shoots the door and kills all of the kids"
"2029","i truly do saport this"
"2030","i can take a 200 pound guy and im 13 watch ne bot gloating i can do it"
"2031","I'll bang that teacher."
"2032","You have that one dumbass who just wants to be killed."
"2033","I had a legit lockdown at my school. Not because there was a person in the school, but because there was a bear that got into the school and was walking around the halls. Montana man."
"2034","Holy fuck dude I mean holding my hands up and cowering in a fucking corner will totally protect me from a school shooter, I'd legit run as fast as I fucking can"
"2035","One day during drama last period, we had lock down that was not fake, like someone legit came into the school and the cops came and it went on for an hr and fucking scared the shit out of out. Still dont know much details about the person"
"2036","What stupid about the fire drill they do in my school is that they do it so often they dont tell us it is a drill so when at the end it is a drill (like all the time) we expect the next fire alarm to be a drill and if it was a real fire we would act like it was a drill calmly walking and not caring. Its like the boy who cried wolf the alarm that called fire."
"2037","I am a warrior I train myself to never flich and never give up. I go to school and always want my friends to be safe but if their is a shooter I will fight and protect my friends. I wish I could protect everyone but I can't im not like superman but I wish I was kind of"
"2038","I would fucking throw a chair threw a window then dip"
"2039","I'd just jump out the window idgaf"
"2040","boi I'm instantly out the window when that Eugene goes into his backpack"
"2041","I'm going to shoot up my school :)"
"2042","for the most part I'd assume shooters would have gone to school and should know the drills, so wouldn't it be more effective to start a fire, to cause an evacuation, then shoot as they come out?"
"2043","what is columbine"
"2044","+Cesar Carlos Arellano we dont do nothing we just hope the shooter dont come and shoot the knob off the door"
"2045","at my school drills we throw toilet paper at the shooter"
"2046","yea same here"

"2048","*shooter"

"2053","shooters*"
"2054","Nat Catty like u"
"2055","Lol y'all act so hard core but I bet in real life you wouldn't even think about attacking them. If a shooter is near you, the last thing you want to do is attack them. The first thing you need to do is get the fuck out xD"
"2056","hit em real quick Like harley quinn"
"2057","Gr8 b8 pal"
"2058","+Joseph Bakerbacker thats what im thinking. unless the guy was retarded a gun vs bat....the fucking man with the firearm will win everytime. i would say they have students wait at the opposite sides of the door so when he walks in the rush him from both sides and beat his ass. better to die fighting than cowering in a corner right?"
"2059","Wouldn't it be better if they just smashed the window"
"2060","Lower Cornet i was born in montana i had a lockdown in kindergarden"
"2061","Lower Cornet haha same but the person was in my school.. colorado man"
"2062","Lower Cornet that happened to me in Alaska winter we had to wait outside in -28"
"2063","Lower Cornet my school caught on fire 3 times so my mom sent me to another school Washington man"
"2064","omg that's awful...."
"2065","+Sinister Potatoe it was last period, so it took away my own time :/"
"2066","Well atleast you had a hour shaved off of your school day"
"2067","+Harley Quinn it's really just common sense though."
"2068","Ianmonty03 thanks for giving the school shooters an idea. We gunna die now 😒"
"2069","Yes, it has been done many times before."
"2070","This actually happened though"
"2071","It was the school shooting (in 1999) with the most casualties before Sandy Hook"
"2072","its a school in Colorado i live 12 blocks away"
"2073","+Sinister Potatoe Shes like 9 lmao"
"2074","How about you google it instead of relying on some person from a YouTube comment section"
"2075","Scary realistic but i feel its necessary. Rather have them ""traumatized"" than dead."
"2076","Fuck this shit Ima run out those doors and run faster than sonic"
"2077","I RUN TO THE FUCKING BACKROOM ACTIVATE THE SPRINKLERS GRAB THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND SMACK THE FUCK OUT OF THAT BITCH"
"2078","5:55 you some ass."
"2079","why would the whole class stay in a corner the shooter doesn't even have to try"
"2080","I had a lockdown that was 6 HOURS !! We had to hear a kid shit in the garbage and hear piss from the other.it was gross"
"2081","I had a lockdown that was 6 HOURS !! We had to hear a kid shit in the garbage and hear piss from the other.it was gross"
"2082","At my old school there was a shooting and we had police officers yelling at us to go room to room and kids were crying and stuff.... And then we had to go stand in the rain for a hour until the search dogs made sure everything else was clear and yea..... They blocked the road from cars so parents were telling from behind the caution tape.... Well yeah!"
"2083","Boy if there was an actual shooter, I'd take a chair, bust out a window and run like a mofo lmao"
"2084","they did this at my school we didn't just hide teachers at random times started pounding on the door"
"2085","can't they just put the desks infront of the door and block it ? the idea is to make a straight line of desk from the door to the opposite wall so the shooter cannot open the door."
"2086","I'm out a window. Fuck that. You want me to sit in a crowd of people waiting to be lit up. Nah nah nah nah nah nah I'm hoppin out the first window I see. Some parts of the second floor, which include all my upper floor classes, lead to the lower part of the roof in my school. Hop out there, jump on to the dumpster outside the janitors room and I'm out into the woods."
"2087","I mean i had to become friends with the weird kids ... Warcraft and anime really aint that bad tbh"
"2088","shiiiit I would've gon up the air vents and hide there bruh"
"2089","I'd just jump in the fucking garbage can"
"2090","I'm in high school, and my teachers said if they're on the other side of the school we should just book it outta there lol"
"2091","it's game over when somebody farts"
"2092","I don't have those drills and I live in Colorado now this video scared the crap out of me"
"2093","it's fucked that this is actually thing! you have to ready your kids for war while they're at school.. damn murica u savage"
"2094","I seriously don't think this is ok. No school should be aloud to do this, mainly 'cause it can cause a lot of problems as mentioned in the video, but can also cause psychological damage to the kids. Some of them may even end up with PTSD if things are taken too far."
"2095","Just keep a fucking 12 gauge Remington 1100 under the teachers desk and you should be good"
"2096","Idk bout y'all but I would be hiding in a locker"
"2097","now"
"2098","lol I used to live in highlands each colorado no I live in Tampa florida"
"2099","MAN SHE IS SO STRONG LOL AND HE'S A GUNMAN"
"2100","yes put them in a pile where it'll be easy to shoot them all"
"2101","Last year my school had a 2 hour lock down because a kid brought a BB gun to school -__-"
"2102","when I got shot it wasn't a drill"
"2103","reasons this most likely won't work.
with this little training I doubt they can handle a grown gunman because he might be holding the gun in both hand? or maybe there is more than one shooter? maybe there's a propane bomb? or maybe the shooting happens in recess or such the same way it happened in columbine. the only fit way I see school shootings from not happening is hiring guards."
"2104","de-sensitizing the students, they wont react as siverely if the real thing happens."
"2105","To all the people saying they'd act hard and tough nah nah nah you'd probably sound like a broken recorder."
"2106","my school childish asf lol they be running around like headless chickens pushing n shit"
"2107","2:02 smile more shirt, dope. where my soldiers at?"
"2108","why the f is he interviewing them when they supposed to stay quiet u never know if the shooter can listen even if ur quiet"
"2109","You are blaming the shooting drill. For your husband's wreckless driving?...smh"
"2110","white people..."
"2111","white people..."
"2112","Fucking stupid. I'm glad I'm out of public school. Did the ""lockdown"" once and that's cause some dumbass forgot they brought a switchblade to school and was hanging out the locker. Lockdowns are as affective as the drill back in the 50's when you'd ""duck and cover"" with your desk shielding you from nuclear annihilation."
"2113","#gotinypeople"
"2114","Our school had an man with a huge ass gun coming down my school road and i was scared"
"2115","what parents show up at school during a lock down??"
"2116","Once we had a drill..and it ended up being a real thing. Nobody was hurt. But it was so scary. I still think of what could of happened"
"2117","Wow yeah I think I'll stay in my country thanks"
"2118","I've never had a school shooting drill like this"
"2119","3:51 lmaoooooo... wrong person xD"
"2120","We had a lock down for 4 hours last year. Wasn't a drill either."
"2121","This is the dumbest thing ever. I understand the point behind NOT telling them it is a drill but you cannot do that. That not only poses the potential for traumatizing those involved, but increases the lack of trust between parents and the school when kids start texting their parents that they could die because there is a shooter in the school. Training could be done in a safer, more effective way. Again, the idea is great, just not implemented well."
"2122","Just strategically place Legos in the classroom and marbles and have oil available to put on the floor. They ain't shooting anybody if they can't keep their balance"
"2123","can we just ban guns ffs"
"2124","if this shit happens at my high school I'm jumping out the second story window I don't care fuck that I'll take broken legs over being shot"
"2125","why are we in a classroom we literally should run if anyone is shooting up my school forget the get behind my desk crap I'm booking it and if I'd look all directions every 5 seconds if I heard footsteps or loud noises towards me my best bet is to calculate where the shooter is and try and find another way to get out just re routing where I go and I'd be moving fast but if I heard noises I'd move slowly but swiftly that's my how to not get shot up in a school survival guide"
"2126","Never mess with the white guy from the dummy's class."
"2127","lol hord them in a small room wait to trap them"
"2128","It's way to easy for the Terast to attack the school because the don't have self defence like a tazer or a trank"
"2129","yea cause the shooter that has is getting wrestled with would defiantly not punch the living daylights out of her..... really???"
"2130","I think that they should teach some to the students if the teacher gets shot and they can't protect the kids."
"2131","Did they seriously not tell the kids or the parents that this was gonna happen????? The fuck????"
"2132","Fuck these people in charge, they should be fired"
"2133","The part where holly was fighting was cringy as shit"
"2134","What's The difference 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😑😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐"
"2135","Hiding in a corner doesn't help anything. They try to make it seem like no one is in the class, but the shooter knows the plan. I would lock myself in the bathroom while everyone else is hiding in the class."
"2136","I wants had a lockdown and that lasted for three hours."
"2137","Also the future teachers will have 12 Gage's be side their desks"
"2138","I am safe my FACS class is full of knives"
"2139","Even though it's a school, exercise the 2nd amendment. Train the teachers to use a gun safely when needed. Why throw balls at them? And near the end the guy ""fighting"" the girl was using one hand. On top of that a guy isn't going to come near you with a gun when they can shoot from 5 feet away. Then what? throw more balls at them? good idea. Btw a teacher is going to be scared shitless to go anywhere near a person with a gun let alone fight them. who's stupid to go near a person with a gun who intends harm? PRACTICE THE SECOND AMENDMENT! There is a reason it was created!"
"2140","Bang bang into the room I wanna bang bang all over the room bang bang into the room"
"2141","WHO SNITCHED"
"2142","THIS IS INSANE!! I'm in 7th grade and we never did this at river ridge!!
Wow!! And I live in Florida too!!!"
"2143","WHY DIDNT THEY FUCKING CALL THE PARENTS, TELL EM ITS A DRILL AND TELL THEM NOT TO TELL THEIR KIDS SO THE PARENTS DO HAVE A FUCKING HEART ATTACK"
"2144","Shut the fuck up. There cops I trust the government"
"2145","Why does this have to be a thing? Oh right because America!!!"
"2146","it's pretty sad that all these people are applauding and laughing through these drills as If it's a game or a contest....  smh,,, it's sad and pathetic that they have to have drills because of this crap these days and it makes everyone scared of guns and all for outlawing them these days because evil people grab some guns which is very easy to do and go shooting up schools which you cannot stop...   it's all stupid and sad and this is what the would have come to these days,,but getting rid of and banning guns Is never the answers nor is stricter guns laws the answer...   it will never happen but sadly to sat we will never be able to evil people doing very evil acts of violence whether it's guns,hammers,knives,blow darts,Nerf footballs or as cops say,alligators,bombs or etc....   it's gotten wat outta hand and I don't know why people just do this to do it all of a sudden but it's kinda funny how it's just all of a sudden now like a trend with shootings at places with just guns huh??  sounds fishy doesn't it?im sure it's all setup by like the government etc,,,  this many people don't just say hey let's go get guns and shoot these places up as much as it's happening,,that just doesn't happen like that and people don't just follow things like that serious of crimes just to go do such acts,,,sorry but they don't and never will it's something or someone behind the scenes making all his happen and it's all for gun control and taking your guns away....   stay in the dark and denial if you would like but that only makes you a fool....  people,,you gotta start growing a pair sooner or later and accept the truth as it is no matter how much you don't want it to be so,,,,I'd rather live in a world of truth than in denial everyday acting as If everything is just fine and dandy.....  balls aren't always smooth!!!!!  have a nice day..."
"2147","how can it actually be a drill? that is just stupid and just pathetic. you are so stupid to even think of doing these drills irl. how do you even know if someone has guns and gonna shoot. ? you think the killer is gonna show up with a AK47 in his back and with a mask and fucking bombs in their body? No. they are gonna look normal as possible, so that way no one could suspect, the drills are unnecessary. cause when a real kill gon show up, hes gon shoot that bullet up yo ass."
"2148","Then there is my school. Two weeks in. (Teacher) ""Oh shoot, we forgot to to the fire drill."""
"2149","We had a lockdown because there where riots in philadelphia and we got out early...we were suppose to have a dancing thing but it was cancelled :-)"
"2150","Holly was really mad when she was against the guy who resisted getting harmed. I can see why she was angry but daaaaaaaaaamn."
"2151","You know you're mature when a camera is in front of a school and all the kids start making faces"
"2152","we have the right to bear arms...how about each teacher has a conceal carry permit. if each teacher was strapped I be the shooter would think twice before opening up shop instead of these pointless trainings and putting fear into the children"
"2153","Stop creating gun free zones, that's how your prevent shooting"
"2154","When your here since psn is down."
"2155","when got some1 shooting u find the best hiding spot or u sprint the fuckout u dont fight a guy 1000 times stronger thn with a gun hoping to win with the help of ur fckin 7 years old students throwing fckin books at him ... would be funny if one nails the teacher"
"2156","At my school, they don't tell us if it's a drill or not."
"2157","One time in eight grade our principal called for lockdown. It was unannounced but we did we were supposed to do in any lockdown. We sat down and our teacher sat down next to us. One student said did you lock it. And she said no I don't have a key and as soon as she said that the principal stated faculty and students there was just recently a robbery at the chase bank please don't leave the rooms. And in that moment i was actually scared and the fear caused me to stand up yell at the teacher. I said are you kidding me you don't have a key, she responded with I lost it a long time ago I couldn't find it. I responded with that's no excuse if you lost it you goto the office and you ask for one we can all die right now and it's your fault. I got detention the whole week"
"2158","I'm not even lying if there was a school shooting in my school that guy better get ready for me standing by the door about to hit them over the head. Sitting in a corner in the dark won't do shit"
"2159","Idk if this makes sense or sounds fucked up but these drills honestly won't do shit. If a school shooter actually does come in the school they will know how the drill works as I'm 90% sure they did them when they were in school. Honestly the only way to stop a school shooting is to have like 1 or 2 armed people around the school. Just my opinion"
"2160","In harsh reality you simply cannot prepare for what you can't predict...You can only use your best judgment while under the pressure of the given situation."
"2161","Dude wtf are these lockdown drills
In WA we just sit in the corner, no guy with a fake gun coming in and terrifying us"
"2162","They just had us dead ass sit in a corner until a cop came. No blanks and its one a year"
"2163","I think there should be a waiver for this but it is pretty effective"
"2164","You know the golden rule
""If Eugene reaches into his backpack, it is time to run"""
"2165","They should do that to 7-12grade"
"2166","Not to be rude but this is kinda fucked up😂 I mean if u were what...like 6 and practiced drills repeatedly and u don't know if it's the real thing or not , your gonna get used to it being fake at such a young age...so when the real thing does happen your not gonna try as hard to keep safe , especially if u don't know it's real"
"2167","Only in America"
"2168","wtf"
"2169","great idea, put this online and teach the school shooters whats gonna happen so they come prepared"
"2170","I fully support these drills. If it keeps kids safe, making the kids scared is a good thing. I would rather have a scary experience and survive if something real were to happen than to go to school without fear and be caught in a real situation without a clue on what to do."
"2171","What if the shooter is a student and already knows the drill and plans a way around it"
"2172","I wonder if arming a teacher would be better"
"2173","At my school they called it a ""code red drill"". They've been happening ever since kindergarten."
"2174","you know it's the states when the schools need school shooting drills"
"2175","My school ""accidentally"" pushed the real lockdown drill button and it was very scary and funny"
"2176","Diego_The_Beast lol"
"2177","Diego_The_Beast you must of all had been very comfortable with each other after that lock down"
"2178","Diego_The_Beast  at least you got out of class for that long!"

"2180","John Smith I'd jump out a window 😂😂"
"2181","John Smith Lmao i only have one class that is in the main hallway. All the others are downstairs upstairs or no where near the main entrance. So id book it whether the teacher tells me to or not."

"2189","søfia fuck no"
"2190","+_SlimePlayzMC
Actually they have a higher violent crime rate per 1000 than we do, banning the guns just encourages gang beatings and stabbings or even worse bombings."
"2191","+Pellinor rawr Do you even know what percentage of people who die by gun in mass shootings is? It's not that much. The media just pumps it up for ratings. Suicide is the #1 by a lot. That sucks, however people who are determined to kill themselves will succeed eventually. If not by gun then by another way."
"2192","RUSH B"
"2193","+Emerson Mugg I feel u😂😂😂😂"
"2194","+Emerson Mugg Bullets will go through a wooden desk. Better odds to just rush the shooter."

"2200","No one from what I have seen has said the obvious If there is a guy with a gun on the other end of the school and I hear a shot in running to the nearest exit and out of there don't hid because they will find you no one goes in blind thy know where you will hide"
"2201","+l JayDo l gj failing to argue his point or at least recognize it but instead giving the response every other autistic twelvie has up his sleeve ""kill yourself hahaha"" I bet you feel real good about your totally original comment. Go back to watching mineman videos okay?"
"2202","Then when a teacher gets annoyed they can shoot up the school"
"2203","give every single student a gun"
"2204","No some teachers are fucking lunatics"
"2205","How about monthly psych evaluations and based on previous records maybe give them one. Or just outright more security."
"2206","Nefer Titty me toooo"
"2207","+Obsessed Fangirl me too"
"2208","Nefer Titty you just sit in a corner and do nothing? Don't put anything in front of the doors or anything? Lmao u ded if any danger comes"
"2209","Nefer Titty ye in SC the principal just softly says there is a drill all teachers lock your doors and we just hide around a cabinet XD"
"2210","BakerGamer123 I LOVE YOUR COMMENT- ""ITS FUN BECAUSE I HIDE UNDER THE SINK"" XD"
"2211","A person who's going to shoot up a school most likely would have planned it for months or years if he isn't stupid. After that amount of time and planning and if he correctly knows how to use a gun then all of this training will be void, he will go into a room prepared with his gun shouldered and he will have his finger on the trigger and he WILL be able to squeeze that trigger faster than a teacher can stop him. End of. Thank god I don't live in a shit hole that allows civilians to use milotary grade firearms lmao"
"2212","School shooter, let's all crowd in one corner."
"2213","I had a drill in kindergarten and I was sitting on the cold.hard.floor. for more than an hour."
"2214","Thats why we have cops in our school although we havent had a shooting."
"2215","and also the gunman will likely not be 220 pounds he will just be an outkast that was bullied all his life by ppl that are 220 pounds lol"
"2216","I love when they tell you to get to the nearest classroom if you're in the hallway. NOPE,  I'm getting to the nearest EXIT fuc u mean"
"2217","How convenient for the shooter that everyone is huddled in the corner, sitting down"
"2218","there's always that one person that has to fart or do some dumb shit to make the whole class laugh during lockdown"
"2219","there's always that one person that has to fart or do some dumb shit to make the whole class laugh during lockdown"
"2220","School shootings are so incredibly common that they train students how to respond   to it. I'd be worried as shit. Maybe try and prevent it or something?"
"2221","I'd jump out a fucking window fuck hiding under a table stupid fucks"
"2222","I think there's a better way to set up on this drill. 
If your all bunched up in a corner, then it's easier for the shooter to spray everyone one down at once.
If your in elementary school, then the kids should be spread out so they are harder to hit.
If it's in a middle school or high school, then have the teacher and students n hide beside the door and jump on the killer right as he enters. 
If the killer gets in the room and your huddling in the corner your basically dead."
"2223","see it's stupid having kids go in a corner like fr at my school we flip tables and desks barricade the doors and grab weapons in case the shooter comes in so we can attack him that's how lockdown drills should be"
"2224","One of my teachers at my school said if that shit ever happens to us just go through the walls and run LMAO (WE HAVE Portables so the walls are pretty thin)"
"2225","If all teachers had guns, there would be no such thing as a school shooting.. just sayin"
"2226","That some bullshit when the women tried it with him resisting he had a free hand he could've just punched her head"
"2227","Okay can you Brits stop circlejerking in the comments about how great your gun-free country is?Because even though we need lock down drills here you guys can't walk down the block without fear of being raped or killed by a refugee swarm."
"2228","My family friend's friend was actually at the Sandy Hook shooting (he moved after the shooting). He was in the classroom right next to the class where the kids were shot. The teacher had the kids sit behind her desk, and she turned the lights off and locked the door. When I saw this kid, his face was so pale. It was so horrible. I can't believe this could ever happen."
"2229","I don't have shooting drills because I live in Canada. ... also the air up here is clean."
"2230","Vietnam flashbacks"
"2231","Shit, my school doesnt even show what youre supposed to do"
"2232","My high school had a bomb scare and everyone was in a lockdown for like 4 hours and left after the police searched the whole school"
"2233","When I was in elementary school, these types of drills terrified me. I just wish schools had better security."
"2234","just be friends with the white kid whos alone, long hair, unbranded or ASICS shoes, has a passion for paint balls or bb guns. or to be non racial anyone who says ""i know where my parents keep their gun"" you fucking give that nigva a ps4 for his birthday man whatever you gotta do man."
"2235","Fuck that what the fuck? my ass is out that window"
"2236","130 mph, yeah ok"
"2237","That looks pretty fun"
"2238","in the end would you rather go through a scare and be have at least some training over nothing? At the very minimum exposing the kids to the adrenaline rush so they know what it's like is better than them not being prepared at all. I personally would feel safer knowing that the kids know what to expect and what to experience to be better prepared than nothing at all"
"2239","So instead why don't they assess the teachers pshycoligically and if they are fit to, then train them how to fire weapons and guns and then the teachers can lock the gun away in a hidden safe in the classroom and if a shooter comes they can bolt the door shut, turn off the lights and then be quiet. But if somehow the intruder gets in they can shoot them dead to protect the safety of those 20 or more so children. Or Atleast put metal bolt doors on the classroom doors and Atleast give the teacher a stun gun or something. Also why not security guards and metal detectors at school entrances. Not entrances to the building but on entrances to the premises."
"2240","Let's put all the kids into a corner to get sprayed down with an M-16 in 5 seconds.."
"2241","Honestly we don't need these stupid gun restrictions and these new ""zero-tolerance"" bully policies that don't do shit and,in fact,probably cause more shootings.What we need is actual police officers at schools to stand guard for shit like this.They have guns,they can be trusted to stop these scenarios."
"2242","you know this is only at White schools"
"2243","None of the tennis balls hit him.."
"2244","Its kind of fucked up to do this and even more fucked up to record it."

"2250","If this ever happens and it's not a drill and it happens at mt school I am gonna be running and not stopping for no one. Fuck it I'll jump out a fucking window. If the shooter is in front of me and I'm with someone fuck it I'm gonna push them into the shooter and run run run. If there is a real fire and they tell us to walk quietly I'm not gonna stay in line and be quite. I getting my fat ass out of that school. HELL NO. NOT TODAY!!!!! BYE!!!!"

"2257","The drama is intense! abc only cared about the drama"
"2258","Hey I live in the uk and this is how our school shooting drill goes.... Oh wait we don't give insane people guns?"
"2259","Dude I had one for 4 hours"
"2260","Wow, how about just ban the FUCKING GUNS.."
"2261","7:55 Look at the teacher all the way to the left. She's probably thinking, throw the ball anywhere, but not on the shooter. I wouldn't want to be in her classroom if there was a shooter."
"2262","They act like their happy to be a part of this ""training"" but if this situation actually happened in real life, I don't think this would help at all"
"2263","Propaganda and more propaganda, this is a conditioning process, a conditioning process for when the petrol dollar collapses and the military takes control of our streets, they want everyone being well behaved minions, or you know whats going to happen?? They will be labeling you as a terrorist,"
"2264","Stupid ass questions by the reporter. You rather stay there and die like a sheep or have a fighting chance moron? These tactics are only meant to be used as a LAST resort only, when you're most likely going to get killed anyways. Might as well give the sack of shit that's shooting a good fight and maybe come out on top. Never understood this pussy mentality of just hiding and waiting for the cops to show."
"2265","In high school we just hide where the teacher tells us and someone knocks on the door and tries to open it as its locked. But middle schools having fake blood and weapons, that's crazy."

It's harder to get a moving target anyway......"
"2281","this is stupid. Fucking grab your scissors. Put that blind down, hear that fucking door screek then jump the cunt and stab the bitch until they beg for mercy. Grab the gun and fucking shove it in his ear and jerk that trigger like you've never pulled before."

"2304","that teachers awesome!!!"
"2305","HERES AN IDEA:BAN GUNS"
"2306","In my school they pick a student, give them a paintball gun, and let them roam during the drill to act like a shooter. The rules also changed, students are told to NOT hide or run, but instead grab anything that could be used as a weapon, and block the door, if the shooter breaks in attack."
"2307","the day after everyone was shot  to deaf jk😂🤔😈"
"2308","In an actual school shooter situation I think you'd be better off stacking all the desks and shit against the door. If the shooter still gets in, then you all might as well charge straight at him instead of sitting there like ducks."

Nobody with a fucking brain is going to go on a shooting, because if others had guns they'd fucking know that well shit you're gonna get shot!"
"2326","+Dat 1 furry why do they have guns?! Like they can just pull up o someone and point one?"
"2327","Yea cuz closing the blinds and blocking the windows for every room in the school will totally make a shooter think that the school is empty...."

"2332","if this is my school I'm already gone like input the window and at a nearby friends house"
"2333","These drills are freaking retarded. Every school does this and the teachers and students are sitting ducks. I am a school student and if im ever in this situation im busting a window and jumping out a window. Id rather hop to a local building with a broken leg than wait in a crowded corner to potentially catch a bullet."

"2342","Why was this in my recommendations?????"
"2343","or you could you know NOT GIVE AMERICANS GUNS"
"2344","chances are a school shooter isn't going to use a handgun, for instance Columbine. If the shooter came in with a shotgun all he would have to do is pull the trigger and he would probably kill a couple of people."
"2345","I'm the school shooter in the school shooter drill"
"2346","I would put legos on the floor"
"2347","Teacher covers window-
Shooter- ""Oh man, okay, well. I guess no ones in there, darn!""
 If there is ever a shooter in my building, I'm fucking outta there."
"2348","How is telling kids to stay in a big group at the back of the classroom gonna help? That'll just make it easier for someone to kill them, plus it means that if someone was gonna shoot up their own school, they would know exactly where everyone would be."
"2349","eh how about you just get the soccer mom's kids in the school shooting drill and just film the mom's arguing with the principal"

"2357","yeah because the shooters just fucking announce themselves when they come in"
"2358","no wonder americans are so stupid, the smart ones are the ones who get shot, bumbass american's and there guns..."
"2359","white school shooters be like ""Gang gang gang"" Lmao"
"2360","The fact that schools actually have to practice this shows how fucked up america is with its gun system and shows how unjustifiable it really is."
"2361","What happens if the gunner was the principal is there a drill for that?"
"2362","But what if the gun man has an assault rifle?"
"2363","And what if the shooter has grenades or comes with a partner? Then again, some training is better than none"
"2364","fuckin stupid"
"2365","Not being funny, but if someone's gonna shoot you, how is hiding behind a desk in the dark gonna stop them"
"2366","He could just pull the fire alarm everyone will come running"

UK: fakes fire; no fire ever actually happens.

Umm...
Where is your gun control lol what?"

"2390","I'm not sure if this is normal but my high school and the middle school connected to it has a few cops stationed in each so the shooters already fucked if they tried"
"2391","So any kid that might shoot up the school is already in the middle of one of these drills? So he knows now what to look for"

"2398","Such shitty schools with the exception of the elementary school.
My school had us block the doors with chairs and then stand around the doors with weapons in case someone comes in."
"2399","If guns were banned in America these things wouldn't happen at the severity that they do "
"2400","ALICE that's what we have to do at my school we have to tie the door shut if the danger is near us but if it isn't we have to jump out the three story high window or we might be able to go down the stairs then we have to run to one of the churches every grade has a certain church and they r like 2 miles away but that's not far if the intruder gets in we have to attack them and put the weapon under the garbage can like yeah......."
"2401","Only in America"
"2402","+ is that is your swat being able to be taken down by small school teacher"

"2412","5:54 that's just fucking retarded. The would-be shooter isn't even using his other arm. If this were a real scenario the shooter could just pummel her face while the teacher is ONLY focusing on the gun. You should disarm the shooter and take him down, not hug the arm that has the weapon."
"2413","They should give a teacher a gun and put it in their desks just incase a shooting occurs"
"2414","a shooter entered my school in 2nd grade I heard several gunshots but no one was dead but the shoot and a cop injured"
"2415","""it's just a prank bro"""
"2416","Hey I found a solution:
Ban guns.
Australia banned guns in 1996 and havn't had a mass shooting as bad as the one then since.

When I was in a school lockdown, we all hid underneath the window and sat quietly. I've done this once in Primary school in yr 2 as a mentally ill highschoolar came onto our oval with knives and hid them in a tree at recess.

Imagine if he had a gun instead."
"2417","And they say terrorism is their biggest threat..."
"2418","He didnt resist if he started punching she wouldnt keep going"
"2419","Wow theres a shooting at her daughter school, says that the husband almost got a ticket"
"2420","thats why I'm friends with everyone."
"2421","I would bust a cap in the school shooter if I had to tackle him lmao why let the fucking school shooter live"
"2422","America where the drills include school shooting? Doesn't that say something about how broken your system is, training a kids to mount the shooter putting them in front a barrel of a gun, why don't you reform your damn gun laws? Drills and training wont do anything to help when the real thing happens and blood starts pouring, this is the sad society you live in where politicians intentionally allow this to happen and for this to become the norm."
"2423","Would've gotten everyone around her shot"
"2424","I don't get the hide behind a desk and pretend that your not in the room. IF ITS A WEEKDAY, WHERE ELSE WOULD THE STUDENTS BE?"
"2425","Just lock the door?"
"2426","since no one said it in comments i will say it. when the guy tried resisting the girl he could had easily choked the girl not to mention his arm reach unless u r a wrestler or are boxer u wont be able to defend a punch from a 6ft 4 inch person especially if u r a female."
"2427","if this was my school and theres a shooter ima wait by the door and tackle them"
"2428","my school makes you run out the window and zing-zag away 
I guess I know who's getting shot first. (me, slow runner*"

"2430","Same"
"2431","+Yoshi sure"
"2432","I wish I had school shooting drills my teacher would drop that shooter then we will all kick him in the face or balls take his gun and shit"
"2433","When people ask what you do say your a school shooter"
"2434","And when she is trying to wrestle him to the ground he can just point it at her head and she is dead and then the other kids will probably die as well"
"2435","+kezeeeeeeeeeeee Glad to hear it. Now arm yourselves so it stays that way."
"2436","+UnkownSoldier100 You must be confused. We're not Sweden.

Retard. Maybe research a little. We don't take many migrants at all. We also have a right wing goverment, that don't want them."

"2438","+Hugh Mungus sorry 45 year old who should not be on YouTube"
"2439","and the fact that people are cheering makes this cringy for me"
"2440","+DailyNewsForGTA it's called ricochet and sparks that will set you on fire. You know what? I hope that happens to the shooter. Gets shot by himself and then catches on fire. That would be hilarious."
"2441","Lmao this kids thinking is like locking the doors and continuing class 😂😂😂"
"2442","Gun can easily shoot off a handle? Are you that stupid"
"2443","Wow America is one fucked up country (no offence)

"2452","Pumped up kicks."
"2453","I will wear a heavy bulletproof vest everyday at school"
"2454","Well. I don't have these drills because New Zealand isn't this fucked up. You have to get a gun licence before you can own and use one."
"2455","fuckn americans"
"2456","If there really was an active shooter everybody in my class would die because they don't know how to shut up"
"2457","One day an actual school shooter will come to their school and they'll think its just another drill."
"2458","Another reason why concealed carry is bae"
"2459","I can't believe that in this day and age, that people actually come and shoot innocent people at a school"
"2460","Only in America ...."
"2461","STOP BULLYING.. School shooting will stop itself..THIS IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM OF US SOCIETY."
"2462","I made my own crossbow that shoots out metal skewers that could penetrate a wooden desk and if there is a shooting I would be the crazy kid who's gonna shoot that shit out of nowhere and kill the cunt before he can shoot me"
"2463","looks fun"
"2464","This is so fucking stupid"
"2465","'My husband almost got a ticket' LOL YEAH THE TICKET IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE"
"2466","What FPS is this?"
"2467","I think it's good for the teachers to know this stuff. Whether or to they use it isn't important. It will be good for school shooter incidents but also in their everyday real life. We get taught some basic self defence in year 10 at school. I've never had to use it but I'm so glad that I at least know."
"2468","And this is why I am so scared to ever visit America. It actually scares me so much that guns are so readily available and that school shootings are a reality."
"2469","Pile em up for collateral hits, nice"
"2470","wish my high school would do this."
"2471","we've all thought to ourselves about how we could be a school hero. I know I have. going all ninja mode on their ass!😂"
"2472","First of all the shooter will shoot the teacher first before he/she can do anything.And they wont let kids throw tennis balls when they have full body armour with an ak-47"
"2473","Why not arm the teacher instead of trying to wrestle away a gun"
"2474","It easy to defend yourself, the shooter starts reloading and he's close to you, kick him in the balls and when he goes to cover his balls grab the gun and shoot 4 bullets into him"
"2475","😑or just have gun laws... OH WAIT!"
"2476","Know how to stop a shooter in a school, equip the teachers with firearms and train them how to use them. Criminals will always be able to get ahold of firearms, no matter how many gun control laws they're are, by allowing teachers to have them, you're leveling the playing field. Instead of having kids in a corner cowering in fear praying the police show up in time (which they almost never do), let the teachers have the option of being their protector"
"2477","that they even have to prepare kids for this is just so sad, how long does it take till they see that guns shouldn't be allowed for citizens."
"2478","If I was a school shooter I would not enter the room like that."
"2479","Every single one of the teachers failed miserably"
"2480","When I go into a class I always look around for a way to escape if things went wrong."
"2481","'Any last words' You don't get no pussy"
"2482","Canada for life yo"
"2483","My school doesn't do any shooting drills and I am in California 🤔🤔"
"2484","why isn't the plan to go after him. realistically a shooter could only shoot at around 1 to 2 bullets per second, say with a 30 round magazine (if he is using an assault rifle, assuming the worst) that's 30 bullets in 15 seconds. on average, it takes 11 bullets to kill a human being not accounting for headshots and heart shots. that means about 3 people per mag. if 10 people in the classroom rush the shooter, statistically he would only be able to get 3 people, that's if he hits every shot and it takes 15 seconds to get to him. realistically it would probably take 5 or 10 which is 1 or 2 people if he hits them all, but then it's over. why do we teach them to huddle into a corner like a sitting duck? why don't we teach them to take an offensive stand against the shooter once he enters your classroom? I can honestly say for a fact that if one came into my classroom, I'm going after him. in my mind, I'm going to die either way, might as well try to stop him before he gets me and everyone else."
"2485","what the heck 'i hope the kids are more comfortable during lockdown' because every kid is comfortable with a gun at their head about to die"
"2486","Im almost in tears thinking what if they did this at my school. I think imma have an anxiety attack. Oh shit this is not ok 😅"
"2487","I wish all schools do this. (@-@)"
"2488","I mean of course its a practice and its fun and all and u know what to do wen the day comes........ but then u realize wen the day COMES..... u have no clue of what to do u just stay panicking and crying and hoping god pertects us............"
"2489","Tbh any school shooter would be stupid to not have a partner or two

I'm not crazy it's just that would be smarter and more efficient 

Btw I'm not saying school shooting are ok or anything they are one of the most horrible things I can think of"
"2490","*shooter mentality* ""AH DAMNIT! The doors are locked and the lights are off, shit maybe next time!."" It's so dumb because what happens when all the kids are in the back of the class and unarmed"
"2491","fuck their lockdown.The sec i hear a shot im already out the door like bitch i aint sitting in class room waiting to get capped"
"2492","humans are natural aggressive and will eventually destroy it's self"
"2493","When the school shooter comes in I'm just gonna throw a chair at his ass 😂"
"2494","fuck I wish my school whould do this"
"2495","The drills are a good idea but if the real thing is happening and the children take it as a drill they might mess up"
"2496","quickly some guy has a gun sit in a corner  so he has a clear shot!!  -_-"
"2497","Wish I did these drills..."
"2498","""modern verison of duck and cover"" im pretty sure that doesnt help"
"2499","my school is gated all the way and the only way u can get in is by u pressing the buzzer and it has a camera"
"2500","fuck no!!! I'm glad this has never happened to me!!!"
"2501","no one knows to fight ? 26 kids vs 1 man . only 9-12 bullets"
"2502","We had a drill like this back in Elementary school. I was a 5th grader and my class was in downstairs in the 1st grade classroom helping them with math. I had to hold a 1st grader that was crying her eyes out because we all thought it was real. The worst they did was shake the door handle and slam on the door. It was a drill but I still remember the dear of holding that child in a dark room. That was seven years ago none of the schools in that area have ever been in a situation where any of that would be needed."
"2503","I've never had to do a shooting drill... We've had fire drills and lockdowns... But my principal doesn't go around shooting"
"2504","Who gets pissed when a news channel talks about video games cause school shootings or mass shootings?"
"2505","Ya lets just sit in the corner with the door unlocked"
"2506","Who shoots up a school with a pistol"
"2507","I'd throw a pencil and run"
"2508","More like what it SHOULD be like i've gone threw more fire drills when i was in school then anything..sad truth but these need to me done more often"
"2509","Our school only does this once a year."
"2510","One time in elementary school I peed during a lock down good times"
"2511","Hell if I was a teacher, I'd guard the door while the kids exit through the window. gunman are usually alone and know they're dead if they exit. staying in a confined space unarmed is suicide"
"2512","omg they use tennis balls as an example instead of staples or whatever. whoever is tryin to take down that shooter is gonna get hit with them because their aim SUX"
"2513","I would fuckin pee everywhere 😂😂😂"
"2514","I would bd as scared as shit"
"2515","At my school the girls go in the corner and some pussy ass boys and the the football players stay at the door guarding it."
"2516","2 years of high school so far and we never had a single lock down drill, even after the school shooting just an hour away from us, and a bomb threat at a school half an hour from us...my school didn't give no fucks"
"2517","Lol we have never ever had a lock down drill and I'm in 9th grade and my brother who graduated high school last year never had a drill so this is lame"
"2518","Fucker should be shot"
"2519","I'm always the one laughing for no reason when everyone is silent idk why😂😂"
"2520","i should not be watching this the day before school now i scared 😰"
"2521","why tf do they all go in the back lmao it would be easy asf to kill them if theyre all grouped up like that"
"2522","You know you have awesome parents when they will fucking risk getting a ticket for your own life"
"2523","I'm moving. Fuck Florida. Thank god I moved schools last year tho. Everyone at my other school couldn't stfu."
"2524","really 130"
"2525","i remember there was a live bomb threat in my Junior year of high school. Terrifying honestly. It was nightmare inducing for some kids. A few years before we had a shooter come through and we were in full lock down. We are prepared now."
"2526","great I live in Colorado I might have a shooter lots of shootings happened in Colorado"
"2527","The teacher should have a gun and kids should get pepper spray and baseball bats. They should all be locked up in a school safety box only the teacher could access if they needed to."
"2528","These wright here sounds like a great/dangerous plan. Because it teaches the students and the teachers how to fight back if something like that ever happens."
"2529","my school just yells code red on the mic and we lock the door and hide...."
"2530","I'm 12 and that was a 8:23 seconds of my life wasted"
"2531","So,


We're all fucked."
"2532","I was in an active shooting in Hawaii. it was a few years ago when I was in 5th grade. we had an outdoor school and we the oldest grade where with the youngest and our kindergarten buddies they were freaking out and so was the teachers and the 5th graders were all trying to calm down our buddies and tying to keep quiet at the same time. occasionly we would here someone jingle the door knob since its an outdoor school. it was also pajama day and we stayed at the school till one o clock in the morning. I still freak out about it and I'm in high school... 😨😨😱"
"2533","Hasn't people picked this up already?  It seems not. Listen, guns are legal in America allowing for edgy teens to grab there dads hand gun and shoot up a school. What if we ban guns due to all of the gun violence in America. Would you rather have your children be at risk or have no guns in America."
"2534","One time I had a real lockdown but it wasn't a shooting, some guy was trying to break in with a crow bar and kill the people in the office"
"2535","my school never does"
"2536","this why we need armed guards, possibly armed students at schools."
"2537","I'd like to see a shooter come in my school and shoot one of the annoying kids first, then I will get up and jump in in its face like ""AHA YOU CANT GET ME"""
"2538","This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Who in their right mind thinks that huddling in a corner yelling ""please don't shoot"" is going to protect and stop that mental impaired individual from busting a cap in your head. We're teaching kids to run away from a shooter...sorry to break it to you but your not outrunning a gun. If there's an active shooter I'm rushing this dude and throwing whatever I can find at him in the process."
"2539","This person comes in with a gun and your ass throws tennis balls at em."
"2540","My school does shooting drills by getting teachers to come around while the students pertend to act like it's real (my class has been bad tho so we failed I tried to keep quit but I have so many trouble makers in my high school) when it's over the teacher opens the door and says it's safe like they would if it was a real drill and also we hide in a corner."
"2541","I'm sorry but at some point you have to be realistic, if you have a 200 pound male that's filled with rage and adrenaline and hormones and who's only thought is to kill people, while waving and shooting a gun, unless your specially trained in disarming a gun and that is second nature to you, your most likely gonna be scared sh*tless, I see the point here but unless these people practice for hours and hours to the point that you don't even have to think about it, it won't be realistic, if you see 5 of your friends dead in a pool of blood around you, your most likely not gonna fight back"
"2542","I honestly get annoyed af when teachers tell you to keep calm when fire drills happen. If an actual fire happened, we all know we'd be out of there running for our lives like ""see ya bitches if you survive"""
"2543","Katya S I agree,a ticket is more important than a school lock down cause it's speeding"
"2544","cause it was a false alarm"
"2545","cause it was a false alarm"
"2546","cause it was a false alarm"
"2547","cause it was a false alarm"
"2548","503*"
"2549","This video is a joke and this twelve year old kid knows it. Maybe they should have had us use these methods in the Marine Corps........... Oh yeah I forgot they wanted us to live so we were issued firearms to fight back with."
"2550","+Clara because a 19 year old is probally watching the vid because they're intresting. Kids nah it just popped up on their reccomended list"
"2551","Why do children always feel the need to say their age?"
"2552","thats racist **ding**"
"2553","Dumbass ponyfucker lol"
"2554","+Nasty Pasty yea because it's a drill and they actually don't want to hurt the guy teaching them...."
"2555","But they totally used tennis balls lmao"
"2556","Did you not pay attention he said not a tennis ball I. Real life but a chair or dictionary or a hole puncher"
"2557","This why you don't you bully white kids"
"2558","The fact that this school feels the need for a 'school shooter drill' is laughable in itself and says a lot about Americas gun control laws. In my 18 years at school I have never been worried about this kind of situation, nor have thought these are in any way necessary, but maybe that's just England"
"2559","Fuck this shit I'm out what the fuck did I just see I'm hopping my fat ass out the window"
"2560","I'd jump out the window and leave the school"
"2561","I am in high school, they should do this  in all schools it is a good thing to learn and it can save lives. A lot  of students think these drill are a joke i tell then this stuff can happen at any time at any moment this type of information can make people safer"
"2562","just a drill bro"
"2563","I honestly would throw a desk and a chair or a stapiler TF ain't gonna throw now freaking gosh dang tennis ballad what's that gonna do distract him for what 5 seconds 😂!!!!!!!!"
"2564","Yes show the shooters where the kids are hiding ! What the whole plan is ! Amazing ."
"2565","If there really was a shooter in my school fuck that corner. You don't think they know? ""Guys don't make a noise they will go away thinking we're not here."" ITS A FUCKING WEDS IN THE MIDDLE OF OCT. FUCK YOU MEAN THEY WILL THINK WE'RE NOT HERE!?

Yea fuck that."
"2566","I'm American and I support the second amendment, but why does gun shops sell automatic machine guns and crap to random ppl. Just give 'em a hand gun and say don't kill anyone with that."
"2567","Me: °gets into a school shooting°
Also me: ""hey can you shoot me first?"""
"2568","So you mean you want us kids to grow up to live in fear? That's fucked up! Why not teach us how the hell to protect ourselves! not rely on these drills to work! The drills won't always work! Also shits gonna go to hell! you got adrenaline pumping it's not gonna be easy knowing you can possibly die. It's like surfing small waves then going to surf mavericks ""surfing small waves is when everything is going right! Surfing mavericks is surfing when everything goes wrong!"" - (Chasing mavericks 2012) Also why not teach kids what could do more damage hell I'm a junior in high school and I know first thing if (hopefully this never happens but the possibility remains) they say ""this is not a drill! We are going into lock down mode!"" I'm running for the fire extinguisher! Soon as they get close pull tab get ready to smoke screen the guy and hit em with the fire extinguisher!"
"2569","Plus what the point of going in the corner. Are we ready to get shot all together? Self Defense is the best way for me..."
"2570","I wanna try a Black Widow by AJ Lee on the shooter and take the gun out of his hands... Yes the best idea EVER!!!!"
"2571","lmao"
"2572","The longest they have had was five minutes!!!!!!! When my school had lockdown drills it could get up to 45 minutes sitting in the dark because there were only 3 police officers checking all the rooms."
"2573","U wouldn't need these drills if guns were illegal in the USA :)))"
"2574","I have lock down drills but nobody pretends to be a shooter with a fake gun"
"2575","We don't have these in england. because guns are illegal here. go compare the shooting rates thingies"
"2576","I've got a good idea why don't they ban guns cuz then there won't be shootings"
"2577","Fuck that I'm halling ass out the window-"
"2578","My local high school did this last year. The school my mother works at they do a new technique of lock downs everyone is constantly moving. I wasn't at the training so j don't know how it works. I don't see how kids siting una. locked room will do anything though  because if the school shooters went to school they know what do to during a lock down. They know that kids are in the rooms"
"2579","Michigan has now endorced the ALICE program. And i go to high school on a college campus because im in the middle college program where you can graduate with a diploma and associates after going 5 years instead of four becaue you are taking both high school and college classes. And they have been training us since 9th grade cause college campuses are the biggest targest when it comes to school shootings. We have to be moving at all times and when we aren't we have to make sure we are locked down tight and ready to fight."
"2580","poke him in the balls with a pencil"
"2581","These drills should be an eye opener for america 
But nooooooooooo Obama be like nahh
So glad im in Great Britain"
"2582","they throwing tennis balls im brakeing a window and getting the f out of there"
"2583","When the teacher and the guy were both rolling on the floor trying. Someone would've been shot. The trigger would've been pulled"
"2584","my school is lucky because the door window has electric wires in the glass so if the do break it they would be electrified."
"2585","If a shooter came to my school Id be like ""Ohhh HEEEEEELLLLLLLLL NAH"" and jump the f*ck out the window."
"2586","umm the fight back teachers there a problem the shooter also gonna shot so it's greater danger they might shoot the leg"
"2587","This is horrible, the fact schools have to do this."
"2588","Her warface tho, students are pretty dumb cus if they're practicing and I was there I would look when they fake shoot and look for the bullets and see if they're real and if they're not obviously not real id be like was up boi"
"2589","Fuck no imma get a concealed carry permit and bring a gun to school for if this shit happens"
"2590","Why the hell would they do that for drills? It's fucking insane"
"2591","Thank god I'm not an American...."
"2592","Oh hell no if my school had the nerve to do a shooting drill without telling us my dumbass would get a panic attack and faint lmao"
"2593","USA USA USA"
"2594","man it really is drill time this nigga got a .40 with a dick"
"2595","guarantee one kid there yelled nope and got the fuck outta there while the others stayed in the class"
"2596","They wouldn't have to do any of that and many lives would be saved if they just banned guns"
"2597","Teachers come up with bad things to do during drills. Hiding in a corner with 30 other people is stupid and reveals a location."
"2598","what do you call a five year old kid with no friends      

a sandy hook surviver"
"2599","Yeah I do the exact same thing and I live in Canada were it's VERY hard to get a handgun."
"2600","here's an idea...stop supplying your fucking population with guns"
"2601","This is retarded, LOLOLOL!!!!! #Publicschoolproblems"
"2602","I thought it said ""What's it like inside a school."""
"2603","at school, were taught to run from the school depending on where the shooter is"
"2604","when gunther fredrickson is tired of these darn bullies"
"2605","At my school, we believe going behind the teachers desk is like a sitting duck. Which means basically doing nothing. We were told and taught how to get out and or attack. After the principal announced we would start the idea of fighting back, all of us were thrilled. Yet sort of scared at the same time. So basically we do the same thing as these teacher were doing"
"2606","Well honestly why should students have to be prepared for a school shooting there should be no guns allowed to even get near school especially by other students shooting.children in America get hold of guns way to easy it's madness"
"2607","Trust me. Attacking the attacker is better than just huddling in a corner where all of you are easy shots."
"2608","Even if there was a school shooter why would you tell your parents to come and get you"
"2609","Bruh they weren't even trying"
"2610","teachers should carry stun guns"
"2611","Just add deadbolts to the doors"
"2612","Just a prank bro."
"2613","just shield your self with ur classmates bodies then play dead"
"2614","During my drills we hide behind a desk... It's terrifying and it's sad that that is the best way of keep us safe :/
Throwing tennis balls? Why not rushing with chairs or desks? We have a lot to work on"
"2615","They are avoiding the real problem"
"2616","When Eugene reaches into his backpack it's time to run"
"2617","now why tf are they hiding behinde a teachers desk"
"2618","It's kinda sad that Americans have to do this"
"2619","That's why you run when Eugene reaches into his backpack"
"2620","There are no guns in the UK. Why do people need them? Update your amendments, and then kids don't have to prepare for this shit. It's sad to think that these as often as fire drills."
"2621","I'll do anything to escape. not be a sitting duck"
"2622","i know for a fact, if someone breaks inside my class, me and my friends will throw chairs, staplers, and pretty much anything hard at the intruder."
"2623","This seems normal to Americans but to us in England it seems weird that there are so many shootings especially in schools"
"2624","just get a tranquilizer. It's easy"
"2625","only a whiteman school"
"2626","Out school doesn't do school shooting drills.  We hardly do intruder drills.  And we only do like 1 or 2 tornado drills.  But living in a small town in Michigan there isn't much potential to have tornados."
"2627","It's simple. If someone tried to hurt me and my friends, I'm not gonna sit in the corner with my head down. Waiting for someone to bust in and open fire. Once he bust in imma taking something sharp and when he reloads, I'm fucking slicing his ndck"
"2628","Schools try to avoid getting sued yet they could  give kids real heart attacks by doing this dumbasses"
"2629","aaand don't forget kids, if there is a shooting, go pile up in a corner so all of you can be taken out with one mag."
"2630","I wish my old middle school was like this one in the video. In my school, the cafeteria was right next to the big gym, and next to that was a smaller gym. Once it was lunch time so a lot of kids were in the cafeteria. We later got an announcement that we were on lock down. They all had to move into the big gym. I was in the middle of P.E in the small gym and I heard everything. As my classmates and I stayed silent, the student's in the bigger gym were all talking really loud and were laughing. One person screamed "" We're all gonna die!"" jokingly then began to laugh. I wanted someone dressed in all black to barge into the big gym and to act like a shooter, ( dressed in black with a painted black BB gun) and show how serious this is."
"2631","Maybe you could just ban guns"
"2632","Is Donald Trump narrating?"
"2633","I never understood why they tell us to just lock the door and sit in the corner like lemmings..."
"2634","idiot school"
"2635","this is SOOO smart"
"2636","In my school one of our science teachers is a professional MMA fighter so i suppose he'd be okay lol"
"2637","when all the other kids have the pumped up kicks."
"2638","My school has intruder drills but they're nothing like this. We just hang out in a corner for 5 minutes and certainly no one pretends to be a killer."
"2639","I know how to fix this 
get rid of guns"
"2640","I am so glade that there was not a lock down in my highschool I use to go to because I would have been screwed since there were no windows to exit out of which is my top plain for cases like that."
"2641","""Let's all sit in the corner and hopefully they don't get us"""
"2642","A women trying to takedown a gun man like that is not going to work at all"
"2643","Well if you're gonna have psychos walking about with guns then they sure seem like a good idea."
"2644","wtf bro this won't work 
1. those weak ass tables won't stop a high caliber bullet
2. no one is gonna attack a shooter 
3. what pussy will actually do this"
"2645","The only way to survive a school shooting BAN GUNS FOR GODS SAKE. Why don't you be like us, the UK, we don't have nearly as many attacks."
"2646","this is so surreal to me, the only drills we do in my school are fire drills"
"2647","We don't do these,
Cause I live in Canada"
"2648","If it were real, I would have jumped out the window.  I ain't staying in a fucking corner waiting for my death."
"2649","My school switched from that stupid hide and turn the lights off drill, to gathering up, finding weapons, and learning how and when to take out the threat (aka the shooter)"
"2650","this is fucking amazing if you believe you can do it plus your adrenalin you could take down that fucker like one person could get him down then the other pounces  this needs to be taught in every school"
"2651","they better watch out, I'm gonna make columbine look like a joke 💣💥🔥🔫🔪"
"2652","this is bullshit !! you shouldn't need to practice this don't have it so easy to buy a fucking gun especially a semi automatic guns"
"2653","I've never understood the lock down logic, if there is a shooter, why pack kids into a corner like sardines"
"2654","That desk isn't doing shit"
"2655","Only in America"
"2656","+kobe evans why would autism work"
"2657","or pretend u have autism"
"2658","Just not a guy yelling and have a fake gun in his hand"
"2659","*teachers"
"2660","notice how people are showing their methods so the shooter can counter it"
"2661","Also the UK doesn't completely ban firearms."
"2662","Then the criminals illegally get guns and it's a 0 vs 1"
"2663","Sorry to break it to you but as tragic as school shootings are we need to look at violent crime and homicides overall; the UK's gun ban in 1996 led to all crime increasing until the introduction of 20,000 new police officers in 2003. Even now, our gun crime and violent crime all in is higher than pre ban levels. Gun control hasn't been the success you preach here. You can't claim school shootings have been stopped here by the ban either, we had 1 then banned guns. There was no history of them or anything, just a kneejerk reaction."
"2664","+Fred0797 The Boss you guys are smart and are able to create policies off of facts, not what you think are the facts. And just like that you are better than america"
"2665","When the teachers were taking down the SWAT members it look so fucking cringy. Especially when they picked out that one teacher and had her go against a guy who fought back a little. 😂👌"
"2666","imagine an actual shooter during a drill"
"2667","They should arm the teachers"
"2668","If there's an active shooter in my school I'll be at home because I graduated lmao"
"2669","Why cower in fear for the shooter to easily pick us off one by one? Why not sit by the door with scissors or books to get him?"
"2670","I told my teacher when I was in 3rd grade can we all grab are scissors and through them at the shooter and she said no and now we're dead"
"2671","And in the process of trying to disarm the shooter the gun goes off and the teacher gets killed."
"2672","I hate those kids who laugh and think it is funny and won't shut up during a drill or emergency"
"2673","They are preparing for the ugenes"
"2674","stupid, throw all the kids out the window. more chance to survive."
"2675","What if this is real and people don't take this seriously. And why the fuck is the women humping the man and the man making noises at 3:55"
"2676","There should be staff members, but only the most responsible members, that have guns in case something happens. If everyone sits there with no weapon they're all dead"
"2677","Why cant the kids jump the shooter"
"2678","This time gunman resistin.. So he would not punch her in face and knock out her and kill her after.. Sure.. Better jump of the window and broke leg then waiting for feminist to save you."
"2679","Yep, school shooter comes in throw a bunch pf balls at them"
"2680","My school says that you do what you want, you can stay and hide, run away, or try to fight."
"2681","when the white kid in back of the class says its high noon"
"2682","if a shooter was in my face about to kill me i would spit in his face lol i would still die but atleast i got the satisfaction of spitting in his face"
"2683","When he said suicide mission did anyone else think suicide squad?"
"2684","Why do parents rush over to the school? They can't run in and get their child nor can they do anything about the shooter, they'd literally just have to wait there for hours till it's all cleared up. And if I were in an active shooter situation I wouldn't huddle up waiting to die, I'd run like hell away from the school"
"2685","0:49 look to the left of the screen that kid waved at the camera xD"
"2686","Better to fight and possibly die than cower and definitely die. Not all rooms have windows to jump out of"
"2687","lol"
"2688","Wow, wow. *clap* *clap* Congratulations you've now told all the future school shooters how they lock down a school. So now they know that any class with blinds on then has kids in it."
"2689","all we do in a lock down when I was in elementary was kept working when the doors automatically lock"
"2690","I wish my school had a realistic drill like this, it makes it better. And its pretty crazy how they do all that just to teach people a lesson... I just want a drill thats this realistic"
"2691","He was one free hand and doesn't punch her ?"
"2692","I think this is good for them. It's like at the the start of the drill the teacher says that you will be safe in a big massive huddle at the end of the room. Then BAM the shooter walks in and kills all of them. That's why I always try to find the best hiding place in each classroom that I'm in just in case a shooter is in my school."
"2693","in my school we hide in the closet problem with that is we cant get out of there if the shooter comes in"
"2694","They shouldn't show this because a person planning to shoot up a school can watch this and know where the students are at and then the shooter can find ways around it."
"2695","What if the shooter walked in and everybody was just acting normal and didn't give a fuck, no way he shoots"
"2696","Bruh wtf did I just watch"
"2697","all the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run outrun my gun"
"2698","this is why America is a bad place"
"2699","im actually really good at english but i just started writing like dat"

"2701","in my school kids are so fuckd up if it ever was a school shoting they would be like "" dawg u know what neighboor hood ur in"""
"2702","4:21 you people really think a 5'4 135-150 pound woman can judo flip a 6'3, 210-225 man like that if he was actually trying to put up a fight. It is good to teach them ways to fight back but it would be best having them work as a team to take the man down safely."
"2703","Fuck that I'm out the window!"
"2704","Before the shcool shoter gets into my class room i would be like, fuck u fuck fuck u, u cool.  fuck u , im out"
"2705","That's why you shouldn't be able to acsess guns"
"2706","My class has a trapdoor shelter"
"2707","the fact you have to say ""how do you prepare people for school shootings"" shows you should properly ban guns..."
"2708","I got an idea. How about giving the teacher a paintball gun and hiding the kids on the same wall as the door?"
"2709","My school kinda just tells us to book it and zig zag away, run home."
"2710","LOL teaching shooters and kids how to take down a shooter? When it's real life and there is a real person with a REAL weapon, none of them would have the bravery to do anything, they would shit their pants."
"2711","I'm sorry but excuse my language hear but it's fuckin stupid how little inocent kids have gotta learn how to survive a shootings what has the wold come 2 now it's stupid that kids need to learn that in America I'm sorry for all the kids that lost there lives but it's stupid that u need to learn that in the U.K. We. Don't but i feel bad for The Americans that they need to learn that because of stupid twats with guns"
"2712","No... to far America"
"2713","Bruh give them rubber shots and suits so we can practice fighting them and shit"
"2714","Great fucking idea pelting the gunner with soft play balls... Fucking spastics 😂😂😂"
"2715","omg that teacher was so badass, I wish everyone was like her!"
"2716","y"
"2717","Who the heck holds a gun in one hand. A real shooter uses two hands or a knife in the other hand."
"2718","I would smash the window and run out and say cya bitches"
"2719","Yep let's all huddle up in a room in tight corners oh hell naw I'm jumping out the window"
"2720","stupid white kids and parents"
"2721","It's just a drill bro"
"2722","Want to know how to survive. SORT OUT YOUR GUN LAWS"
"2723","I'm sometimes confused by the actions of people. If you have the means to escape by going outside, why not do it? The shooters inside the school so why stay inside? My school makes us shut the blinds and turn off the lights. Like wtf? The shooter obviously knows we're in the classroom so idk how that's helping anyone. If I have the opportunity I'm out the door. Huddling up away from the door is a great way to get shot. At least if your outside and the shooter sees you, there's only a 4/100 chance you'll get shot as a moving target and it's even a smaller chance that'll it'll hit a vital organ. I think that's a better probability then staying in a classroom. Like what are we going to do in the classroom? Run around and play duck duck goose and hope the shooter doesn't choose us? It's even better if a whole bunch of people run outside bc that's even less of a chance of getting shot, especially if the shooter is inexperienced. But that's just my opinion."
"2724","98% of mass murders are committed with handguns."
"2725","My teachers in my school practice jumping out the windows and onto trees to break the fall"
"2726","Only in America this shit will happen lol and also if it was a drill I'd escape school and have an excuse"
"2727","My teacher is huge he has 6'2 and 300lbs no one getting pass him lmao"
"2728","Teacher would have got her ass kicked by the intruder with that type of fighting"
"2729","meanwhile in south africa we only have fire drills the fact that the need for these drills exist is frightening"
"2730","8:32 Pokemon Go song kid on the left"
"2731","0:50 a kid waved"
"2732","I as a Britishman hold my arms wide open and welcome you into our country where you won't get killed at school due to England having one of the worlds strictest gun laws."
"2733","Couldn't the class just wait at the door then have like 30 people jump on him and stab him with scissors and shit"
"2734","We once had a two hour lockdown at my school because this dude robbed a bank and hopped the fence into my school when I was in third grade. Why huddle in one place where it's easier to get killed when you can SKRRT YOUR FAT ASS OUT OF THERE"
"2735","I've passed by that school once"
"2736","omg"
"2737","What if someone has a bulletproof helmet with a machine gun"
"2738","i weigh in around 250, if a 100 lb girl tried to disarm someone my weight i wouldnt be struggling id be throwing punches if i really wanted to get out of the hold"
"2739","OH NO, THERE'S A SCHOOL SHOOTER IN THE SCHOOL! LET'S ALL HIDE IN ONE ROOM  AND NOT RUN OR DO ANYTHING, THAT'LL SHOW HIM!!"
"2740","this is fucked up"
"2741","All the other kids with the pumped up kicks"
"2742","Guns legal is the first problem and probably the only reason this happens"
"2743","130 mph? *john cena comes out* ""Are you sure about that?"""
"2744","I'm sorry but parents are upset cause they had no warning of this drill??? THAT'S THE WHOLE GOD DAMN POINT!"
"2745","Cant it happen that one of the students they learn how to other kids how to hide and where and it use it as a advantage?"
"2746","It's saddening that we have to now learn ""active school shooting drills"" bc it's become that common for a person to shoot up students in a school."
"2747","This never happens in texas, our teachers have guns"
"2748","""School shooting drill""??  ""Active shooter""??
Keeping handing out those guns, America."
"2749","I remember when there was a man with a gun on the high school campus down the block from my middle school. they put us in lockdown too. they weren't clear that the shooter wasn't on our campus and one of the 8th grade classes ran from the trailers to down the street to a yogurt shop"
"2750","Just don't bully the white kid with no friends"
"2751","How my school does it is the principal announces that we are having a drill... Then me and my classmates go in the corner for 2 minutes then they announce like all clear or something.
This way is just pathatic... Its wasting a half an hour to an hour of the day"
"2752","that don't even look scary tbh"
"2753","Or you could focus on the gun control in your country..."
"2754","My art teacher just said that we have 'art supplies' when the topic of school shooters came up. Then pointed to the shelves of rollers, knives, glue guns..."
"2755","haha I remember these, we use to download some fart apps and just abuse the shit out of them. Such immature times"
"2756","I'm on the first floor, so I'm out the window."
"2757","Those poor two kids get hit by tennis balls from bad throwers"
"2758","Idk why this was in my recommend tab 😂"
"2759","Rape! Rape! Save rape!"
"2760","Ahhh the good old days when we brought sharpened pencils to the huddle in the corner. Now we get to barricade the door and get weapons and stab anyone that comes in"
"2761","just get rid of the guns"
"2762","We don't have these in England. I wonder why..."
"2763","alright, where's leafy"
"2764","If that happened to me  I will go in my beast mode"
"2765","Jake O'Brien oh yea that's so dumb OMG I just relived that😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱"
"2766","Yeah come on they're gonna know that a blind down means there might be people in there with or without this training it's common sense. May as well give the kids / teachers a fighting chance though. The attacker will know when his weak points are but the kids don't until they're told, they might as well know."
"2767","assuming that the shooter has been to school and the school has also done practice lock down, he most likely would know how they work anyways"
"2768","*them"
"2769","Many years ago when convince stores used key lock safes, I was a manager at a convenience store. My assistant got robbed one night.  She was fine, and the robber only got away with $35.  My assistant didn't have safe keys, I did.  She told the robber that. He took the money and left. He was unidentifiable except that he took the quarters. The police called him the quarter robber. A few days later I'm reading the newspaper about the quarter robber strikes again and how the assistant manager told him the manager is the only one with safe keys. I looked down at my light blue striped manager shirt and red circle targets started appearing on my shirt. I freaking hate the media. I went straight to them and told them I needed a job and not one delivering papers. I was so angry!"
"2770","yup"
"2771","Whoever is shooting most likely knows where they ""hide"""
"2772","assuming that the shooter has already been to school and they did lock down procedures, they would already know how people hide and since the principle goes on the intercom and states that they are in lockdown, they would already know what is going on"
"2773","is it just me or was i the only who swipe the sceen"
"2774","FUCK your picture"
"2775","+Charlie Leonard it wouldn't confuse them at all, in fact the shooter would probably be happy to have easier targets"
"2776","That would confuse him for like 2 seconds then he would just shoot everyone"
"2777","........ Nice logic"
"2778","same"
"2779","That what you're supposed to do for alligators OMG"
"2780","if you zig zag while running you may as well kiss your ass goodbye"
"2781","same"
"2782","+LOL boi I know too many people that are on edge, that's my sense of creativity. Half these kids carrying backpacks to every class are fishy as fuck"
"2783","+Catkins Boi what tf actual fuck is your creativity, it sounds so childish smh"
"2784","Or like paintballs to indicate we would have been shot"
"2785","I'd rather get shot once than get stabbed 7 times in the stomach. This is why violent crimes are up over there"
"2786","+Eddie Carpino While I do love a pile on I'm afraid Russia is the country with the highest murder rate in Europe followed by Ukraine. Then France then the UK ties with Germany for fourth place in murders in Europe."
"2787","Then why do you have the highest murder rate in Europe?"
"2788","So isn't that a good thing that you're missing out on class 
Ps who ever the shooter is he would probably not kill you but rape u tbh"
"2789","And they say arabs are terrorists and shit , in my country (kuwait) we dont have any school shooting / stealing happening in our country"
"2790","why isnt my school practicing this?!"
"2791","Well now then killers know where the kids hide"
"2792","At my school we barricade the door and we can go out the window if anyone is really there"
"2793","I'm in Canada, one time in Grade 9, we had a lockdown test, and our science teacher just kept on teaching. He was the best"
"2794","Why don't they fucking barricade the mother fucking door?"
"2795","Imagine a school shooting drill occurring 20 mins. before a real one😂"
"2796","i fully support making the drills realistic, and training the teachers how to take down shooters (you never know when it could be needed)"
"2797","it is kind of fucked up to do this to kids but really if it happens again people should at least have some knowledge of what to do and how to protect themselves. like the guy said it's not about going on some suicide mission to hunt the killer down, it's about trying to save your life and your students lives when the gun is pointed at you and they're about to pull the trigger."
"2798","The way I see i if ur gun laws were stricter you wouldn't see school shootings. How many do the uk get? I think we had 1 last year?"
"2799","fucking pussies"
"2800","We have 320 million people and the world's number 1 gun trafficking country just south of our border. Over 90% Of mass shootings happen in gun free zones. Someone mind explaining me how gun control works?"
"2801","I think I finally figured out why this came up in my recommended.



Probably cause I was listening to Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People



Yeah. Seems about right."
"2802","Thank fuck for Australian laws"
"2803","Don't let the White emo kids see this 😂😂😂"
"2804","I think this is great why the fuck wouldn't you try to fight back, its your fucking life on the line or someone else's."

"2806","holly carpenter is hot"
"2807","Only in America guys"
"2808","Maybe the principal should have a gun in a safe in their office. They wouldn't expect a thing"
"2809","I know how to stop that shit. Every single student in the class grab a fucking chair and wait by the door. When he walks in you pound his ass. Or if i hear across the school I'll fucking run."
"2810","A Police With A Gun Is A School Shooter. DAFUQ"
"2811","in Australia, I find this idea insane. I can't imagine having to actually worry about how a student at my school might come in one day with a loaded gun. I honestly find it terrifying."
"2812","if i was there i would sneak up and punch them"
"2813","It's sad but necessary"
"2814","Of course all the shooters are white"
"2815","there's a shooter! I really hope he doesn't look over here in this corner! 😥"
"2816","I hate living in England but thank fuck we don't have a gun problem here lmao"

"2819","#AmericaFuckYea! #GreatestCountryInTheWorld #USA1
Its funny this shit happens so often you have to do drills."
"2820","my boy said he was gonna get a back to school gift

"2821","Dat mother stole my name. You bitch"
"2822","I like many aspects of America and it is a great place to visit for a holiday, but I am glad I live in Australia."
"2823","Damn Eugene not again"
"2824","Yeah! Let's throw balls at that well totally hurt him."
"2825","It's cause of Americas fucked up gun laws"
"2826","Oh my god... about 30 people in a room shaking from one guy? Jesus. Grow a pair and take him down already."
"2827","I already started talking to all the Eugenes in my school so if theres a shooting I'm fucking good"
"2828","In my school we have so many fire drills that one time when the bells started ringing and we we're just laughing there was a real fire lol"
"2829","We only have fire drills in Norway."
"2830","i'd be hauling ass from the window if a nigga come shootin at school"
"2831","I wish women jumped up on me like that"
"2832","of course train these kids and teachers. it has the same sense as having pilot training when being force to fly a plain compared to someone that has no pilot training. school is about learning and right now in the world we live in this is a relevant educational class."
"2833","They don't know what kids can do when we become savage"
"2834","Holy shit I'm glad I'm doing online school"
"2835","I'd spiderman out. Glide out of the fucking window. Jetpack the fuck out of that school. Fuck the rest. Im trying to survive here. I'd sacrifice my class mates I dont care."
"2836","so school shootings are advertiser friendly..."
"2837","I don't have to do this because my country has STRICT gun laws. You can not purchase a gun with cash. You can not purchase a gun if you have a criminal record. You can not purchase a gun if you are under the age of 27. And only 2 stores in my country can sell guns. Hunting & Fishing and some online gun retailer. But you have to go through checks before you can buy the gun"
"2838","Lmao get the fire extinguisher and spray the motherfucker"
"2839","oh America. your country is quite strange"
"2840","How many people have to die for Americans to understand that their gun laws are the cause of most mass shootings.... It's so sad to see how stupid people can be."
"2841","We did this drill but no one gave no shit"
"2842","Fuck that just block and lock the door and jump out the fucking window one by one and run"
"2843","got this from a video.

if there's a shooter and the one kid is crying I'm knocking their ass out like really now we're all gonna die cause you won't shut the hell up. you know what?! I'd make that kid the sacrifice like you know what?! He knows where we're at. and someone's finna die so it makes the most sense if it's you since you GAVE US ALL AWAY"
"2844","We dont have drill cause we have a hammer :)"
"2845","Wake up America if you didn't have guns then you wouldn't even need to prepare for things like this. How many children have to die in school for this to happen."
"2846","What if an active shooter goes to the office and holds the people in there hostage and says through the microphone that they're doing a drill but really he's going through ever class spraying niggas????"
"2847","I know this is a serious thing but when they got to the part I died like when they tackled them down like I could see like some frantic kid throwing the pet hamster at the shooter and a bunch of 6 year olds jumping on him"
"2848","America needs gun control"
"2849","These comments are honestly the funniest shit about these videos"
"2850","Have we never assumed that most of the school shooters go to the school and probably know the drills so the can just find a way to get into the class room and shoot that circle of kids in the corner"
"2851","This is why you ban fucking guns in America dumbasses"
"2852","Students get ""horrified"" he says while they're laughing their ass of while the guy is out there yelling ""I'm going to kill you"""
"2853","Wtf am I even watching lol"
"2854","I'd like to see a school shooter try to attack the class of those kids from that movie hostel 😂😂his ass would get stoned to death"
"2855","1:25 ""my husband almost got a ticket coming over here, he was doing 130mph."" Well smoker, I mean lady, that's hid own fucking fault, not the schools."
"2856","Well australia dosen't have shootings so i've only had 1 lockdown drill, we barely have any type of drill actually xD"
"2857","white kid *heavy breathing*"
"2858","At least I live in England where we don't have fucking dumb gun laws."
"2859","We did a drill like this at our school and some fake gun man kicked the door of our class and some kid yelled ""hey we're in here"". I'm fucking dead if this shit actually happens"
"2860","why would they want it to look realistic? hell just a dry run without weapons  (which shouldn't be used in a drill in the first place) was enough for me"
"2861","The fact that we dont even have drills for shootings in Australia really says something"
"2862","Well most middle schoolers and high schoolers are stronger than there teachers. So i don't really know why they are talking as if they are weak 😕"
"2863","*Robert's got a quick hand. He'll look around the room He won't tell you his plan*"
"2864","""A legitimate shooter"". Yeah....ok"
"2865","Wow. Tennis balls!?😂 and like those small teachers could really throw the shooter down. The trainers lay down for the teachers😂😂😂 and who's gonna run towards a shooter while they are unarmed!!!???"
"2866","Id be a great shooter. come with a master key and a couple spare magazines. practice quick reloads, maybe get some fast mags. also if i was a student, id get on that shooters ass. not as bad as a serial killer."
"2867","haha ha America"
"2868","best protection, get out of American"
"2869","me and my classmates jumping his dumbass"
"2870","the worst thing that's ever happened to me was a lock down at my old elementary school because there was 2 drunk ladies fighting for about an hour and a half outside the  school"
"2871","They could just put cops in the school"
"2872","Lol at 3:50 the one of the teachers jumps on to another teachers back instead of the ""shooters"" so looks like training going well..."
"2873","I still say arm the teachers but this is awsome practice. much better than cowering in a corner waiting to be shot"
"2874","Thanks ABC, now I will keep 200 tennis balls w/ me in case of a school shooter"
"2875","Those were the noisiest teachers on earth"
"2876","They can't do these drills where I live because the shooter would get shot or stabbed by a student"
"2877","Even when my school knows it's a drill they're always so dramatic"
"2878","It's cute how they think this a good rehearsal of what a shooting will feel like. But really during this, they will have more stage freight than actual fear. It's always is nice to think that you will be ""the hero"" who saves the day, but only few people will use the adrenaline gushing through their veins to backup what they said. In reality no one knows when or how one will die, you can live in fear planning for that day to come, and maybe just maybe you will escape death. OR you could just live your life happy and strive for what you want before that day comes. Can't fight fate. You will never expect a gunman to walk through that door, it's that surprise fear that makes people shut down in stressful scenarios. There's really nothing you can do. This was a waste of time."
"2879","I feel so many things ..both way"
"2880","don't mess with the crazy ass white kids"
"2881","what im thinking is they all go in the corner how ever if some one has a high caliber it can kill more then one with one bullet my opinion"
"2882","While taking the gun men down the gun is waving everywhere and could fire and hit a kid"
"2883","Why am i watching this"
"2884","Bullshit all you mother fuckers is white!! Come to the fuckn south side chicago"
"2885","And the extra training for teachers is good"
"2886","They should've notified the parents just before the start of the drill. Not the kids, just the parents."
"2887","Only in america"
"2888","The drills are ok when the student knows it's a drill, but if the kids don't know it's a drill that could traumatize them."
"2889","You can't ban guns. There's over 300 million of them and we will turn violent."
"2890","+Razor R  the second one. 
sounds like hardcore mode :o"
"2891","+Unknown Celeb A gun ban wouldn't do much good considering it's easy for wrongdoers to get, however to prevent as many unfit people getting their hands on them, strict background checks, permit requirements, firearm training class, ban higher powered weapons and psychological testing so that only responsible people an own them for self defense as well as hiding, and for your point of self defense, you have a point when your attacker is unarmed but not when your attacker is point a gun at you. We already have millions of guns, banning them wouldn't get rid of them and mass confiscation is going to be a miserable failure."
"2892","+david otuwa there was one in a school in Pennsylvania. So when are we going to talk?"

"2922","I'm joking
"
"2923","they should have warned parents and polices if they gon take out fake guns..."
"2924","""hes was doing 130"" ahaha okay"
"2925","Lol imagine their reactions when they say it was just a social experiment look there's a camera XD"
"2926","so they're actually training the shooters in America now"
"2927","Yeah, my school has a lot of windows. If I hear 1 scream and gunshot. I'm running my brown ass back home, so I can hide under my blanket"
"2928","drills dont work brought a m16 to school and kiddwere just like sitting ducks"
"2929","yes kids plz go in a corner while the man shoots a spread shot gun at the corner where you hide behind a fliping plastic desk"
"2930","probably just stay near the door incase they come in and tackle em"
"2931","I'm sorry but when I heard the guy say ""They say they won't use weapons next time"" i just picture a guy with his finger gun going ""PEW PEW I'LL KILL EVERYONE! PEW PEW"""
"2932","Honesty I'm more worried when the fire alarm goes off, because everyone goes out to the football fields and stands In a giant crowd. Ya know how easy it would be to set up explosives and remotely detonate them once everyone got out there? Yeh, we really need to think about our procedures"
"2933","""please go behind my desk"" is it bulletproof or something?"
"2934","But then when there is an actual shooting they will think it's just a drill"

"2946","this is retarded, especially when it's a drill, we just scream and shit like retards and yell the most dyslexic shit there is. No drill is scary, but I'd this does happen it would be scary, and for a drill when it's a actual school shooter, why would you want to go into the school, wouldnt you want 2 run out and not hide in the room? you can easily shoot down the door and boom they all dead, again this shit is stupid"

"2953","Are those ""disarming"" methods really safe though...? That girl didn't actually disarm the guy and the way they were wrestling around it seems like the gun could go off at any moment."
"2954","I'm sure you aren't supposed to text or call your parents about lockdown because it causes panic and they just crowd the place. Shooter at the school, lets rush and save my kid......"
"2955","tbh this is a good idea. (at least at my school). at my school we had a drill lockdown and everyone knew it was fake (not for sure) and they didnt even care. they just started talking louder and i swear my teacher didnt give 2 shits. im pretty sure he was hoping it was real because he hates our class. a week later there was a real lockdown because theres a primary school next to our high school and a girl from the primary school got suspended and lost her shit and came over to the high school. luckily nobody got hurt and also i was at home."
"2956","Birdman anyone?"
"2957","If I walk into a room ready to shoot and everybody sitting in the corner and then attacked me I would quit because they were corner camping."
"2958","Dude at my school they have the door locked and barricaded with chairs and desks with a piece of wood that would hold the door"
"2959","WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY THROWING FUCKING BALL AT HIM 😂"
"2960","hiding under a desk in the corner? no, fuck that shit. I'm hopping my ass out the window and booking it."
"2961","They're going to take it as a joke when its not a drill cause they're going to think its a drill"
"2962","I'd wait behind the door with a big ass textbook and smack his ass"
"2963","Look up the shooting at a nightclub in South Carolina that occurred not too long after the one in Florida. The only reason why you haven't heard of the one in South Carolina is because nobody died, and you have any idea why?? Cause someone there had a conceal carry permit and shot the shooter dead before he could kill anyone. Liberals don't like good publicity for guns. To the liberals guns are bad bad bad."
"2964","Your country is fucked"
"2965","Oh hellll naw that shit happens im grabbing a pencil or something im not about to huddle up in a corner fuck that im killing the dude"
"2966","the reason why the school shootings are going up is cause the crazy people realize the schools wont do shit if you go in there and pick off a class or two. by the time the cops show up half the school is dead."
"2967","Give teachers guns"
"2968","How about you fix your fucking gun laws?"
"2969","What you gotta do is get all the kids to huddle near the door and when the shooter comes in tackle him. He cant shoot all of you at once. And its better than waiting to die."
"2970","""Hey here's an idea, let's lock the door and line all the kids up in the back of the classroom!"" ""Yea! that will keep the kids safe!"" Fuckin retards."

"2974","This ain't stoppin me from shooting up schools 🙃"
"2975","what of there was more than one shooter, the defence would not work at all. Like if you agree"
"2976","Change the gun laws stupid"
"2977","So let's teach the kids to hide in a corner with the lights off in the class room and door locked. Because the school shooter definitely isn't going to know this when he's already been threw the drill"
"2978","White ppl"
"2979","Kick them in the balls ( insert Lenny face here )"
"2980","might as well set the school on fire for a fire drill"
"2981","Has anyone ever had this lockdown and knew it was a drill but still kinda thought it was real and got scared"
"2982","Honestly duck and cover cant stop a shooter from killing kids, lining them up like that just makes him more efficient. You would have a much better chance of living by running."

"2995","Racist comments like those is what's triggers them"
"2996","great idea! just group together in a corner with no escape so you make yourself harder to shoot!!! yaaaayy"
"2997","I sharpen my nails, so one of my friends said to just slice the shooters throat open with it......:I"
"2998","we all need guns"
"2999","fun fact 
in some areas of the middle east , by law the teachers carry guns 
those areas have never had a school shooting since those laws were enforced

my point 
if a psycho is gonna go shoot up a place 
he's way more likely to go shoot a place where he can't get shot back"
"3000","I'm not gonna hide in the corner xd I'm going to hide right next to the door and take him down"

"3010","theres a saying and not to.be rude the most quitest person in school is the most dangerest"
"3011","so I love what there showing them but to tell you the truth the best way is to go behind a des or some thing and lay down on your stumick and breve slow ly as you could and just be quite beacouse who ever doing that is not going to look around whos dead or not bc he going to think theres no time AND think every ones dead so thats the best way to do it and it might be scary but you have to be quite or your done one.little skweak thats it your done  and you stay like that till cops come you don't move you don't cry you lay and act like your dead."

"3013","The shooters usually go to that school, they're gonna know all of the drills"
"3014","Lmao we had a lock down at my school once cause somebody was armed and on our campus, and everybody started screaming and making jokes but we had to stay for about 3 to 4 more hours and around the 2 hour mark alot of people started crying"
"3015","My school has us barricade the door and arm ourselves with scissors and heavy objects. Sitting in the corner is stupid and is basically asking to get shot"
"3016","My school does this. They give us a speech first and tell us what's going to happen and then tells us someone is going to be wearing a yellow vest. If you see him run for your life. Then at a random time a guy runs onto campus and you have to run to the nearest open classroom lock yourself and others inside and block up the doors and wait. One foreign exchange student didn't understand what was happening and heard screaming so she started running and ran to our classroom and started crying in fear and just sobbed throughout the entire thing. It was completely terrifying and rattling."

"3024","im waiting for the day the kill count reaches over 500 in a school. i really want to see a school massacre maker who can excel in his/her work. all the killers are lousy nowadays. not supporting death of the innocent, its just that its too redundant seeing unprofessional players in this field of expertise. the field being effective killing. question: how well can a school killer do? how smart can they get? How many? ISIS? im actually very curious, but not in a terrible way. also, back in my past high school, next to the football field is a small apartment place, like really small, and the cops park in the entrance, and you cant see them but they can see you because theyre behind trees and youd have to go past the trees behind the fence under the shade in order to see them, and its medium range and you see who comes in and out, great spot for cops to catch those coming in and out of a major campus exit. like freshmen going out of campus to eat. tsk tsk.

also i remember going to get my diploma and they thought i was a school shooter lol. i actually feel really bad for my school."

I want to see your teacher's reaction to this. 😝"

"3083","just let the teachers have guns :D"
"3084","These drills are bullshit, sitting in a darkroom like a bunch of sitting ducks is not going to protect you form a heavily armed shooter. We shouldn't be taught to  fear the in evadable we should learn how to fight back and disarm someone.  I had to do this same drill for twelve years."
"3085","Columbine High School's basketball team hasn't been the same ever since they lost their 2 best shooters :("

"3087","Maybe ban guns?
Just an idea"
"3088","I would rather have this then being a sitting duck, look people the instructor didn't say it because he had a camera in his face, but this is basically for the time when the shooter gets in the room and rather then sit there and wait to be killed, you should at least fight for your life, the more training you have the better. It don't hurt anything!!!"
"3089","At my school we have drills but not as extreme as this. Instead they tell us someone is on school and usually the security guards come around and shake the door handle"
"3090","So when the teacher is wrestling the shooter around (as seen in 5:55), we're supposed to expect that the shooter won't pull the trigger and fire the gun at where ever it's pointing?"
"3091","if my teacher. was getting thrown around like That I would rack that guy"
"3092","Teaching teachers on how to take down a shooter? Let's test this scenario:

*Shooter Shoots through glass on door, bullet hits and seriously hurts the teacher that happened to be in front of the bullet.* 
*Students are junior high schoolers and none of the kids in the class know nothing about material arts.*
HOW will teachers keep their students alive, when the kids can't even fend for themselves?"
"3093","fucking corner campers"
"3094","In my school every teacher has a gun in their classroom and they are supposed to get desks and barricade us and try to stall the shooter as long as they can so we can either jump out the window or run"

"3096","Now I know where they hide.  😊"
"3097","This shit is so dumb"
"3098","ok so say that I'm the shooter, what if I go to school and I'm in like 1st period and I take out my glock and start shooting, will the principal still say this is a lockdown even though I would still be in there? or would everyone just run for their lives?"
"3099","All they are doing is convincing kids that none of the drills are real. Great fucking job you dumbasses."
"3100","Miss Carpenter got it goin on ;) ;) ;)"
"3101","there should be a safe room thing in schools"
"3102","Lol only in Murica"
"3103","if they are all in one corner its easier for the shooter to kill em"
"3104","I don't think that the super realistic drills should be happening mostly because if the students didn't know if it was a drill or not which lets say metaphorically it is wouldn't practicing it so much make them not take it seriously if they didn't know if it was a real situation"
"3105","This is why they take our phones during a lockdown....so we don't freak out and text our parents and parents don't block the police from getting to the school"
"3106","This is why you eat lunch with the weird kids"
"3107","If I controlled the drill:
1. Barricade the door with anything you can

2.spread out across the room instead of sitting in a corner where you get sprayed like nothing

3. Teachers should have permission to silence anyone by force if they are making too much noise.

4. If all else fails jump out of the window and run if there is one.

5. Common sense: school shooters aren't bank robbers, they are there for the sole purpose of killing. Sitting there with your hands up will do nothing but get you killed.

6. Why go to school anyways, the food sucks, bullies, that one shitty teacher that everyone has, wasting 7 hours a day out of you valuble life, the risk of being just another casualty statistic..."
"3108","Jesus I must live in a safe area. The most that we have as a drill is a 'lock down in place' where we are just sitting in our chairs, being quiet, and locking the door -_-"

"3111","fuck what the parents think watch had this been real they would be bitching why the fuck weren't y'all prepared for this something should be done so you parents need to shut the fuck up"

"3135","Why not text 911 stupid"
"3136","that's why you need to be nice to the crazy white kid"
"3137","The problem with frequent, realistic drills is that it can turn into something equivalent to ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"". I know from my own first hand experience. Kids would just start messing about and not being serious the more frequent the drills become. The key is to preparing them without it becoming tedious and ""just another drill""."
"3138","Every teacher who was in my old school is fat as fuck. They seriously need to exercise instead  of drinking Dr Pepper all day. imagine a teacher that weigh 500 lbs, trying to wrestle a shooter when he's holding a gun in his hand. Unless the teacher can just sit on the shooter and squish him to death."
"3139","Teacher: ""Lets go shut the blinds and sit in a corner"" basically meaning (Let's make it obvious were in here and let's sit in a corner so we can all get killed) Me: ""let's put stuff in front of the door slow him down smash a window and get out"" meaning (Let's smash a window and were getting the fuck out of here."

"3142","This is stupid, wouldn't that make it easy to shoot them? My school just makes us get away from the Windows, turn off the lights, and put a big piece of paper on the door window. They act like shooters ain't smart enough to kick down the door and shoot us up."
"3143","Jesus Christ we had a drill last year it didn't scare me that fucking bad as this video did"

"3146","If me i would grab the gun aim at the shooter"
"3147","that shade really camouflages that door."
"3148","this wouldnt be needed in schools if guns were outlawed"
"3149","I'd just bite the shot out of the motherfucker"
"3150","Tbh school lockdown drills don't work, shooters aren't dumb enough to not know that there's kids inside the classrooms. What the hell is sitting in a corner with your hands up gonna do? You're better off hiding right next to the door where the shooter can't see you, and then smack him in the head with a chair or something that'll knock him out. Smarter imo."
"3151","at 8 min evreyone would just trample the shorter in real life also fuck that bitch who said this prepping is scaring kids"
"3152","A few of my friends are quite strong, so I feel like we can work together and take the guy or girl down if this happens. Luckily where I live, guns are given out to hunters and police. If you don't hunt, and arnt in a police force, no guns."
"3153","Parents need to chill out and not baby their kids into believing that this world owes them a good life. 

My last year of middle school was this year and honestly these drills are not that scary, honestly they're pretty annoying. Some of the staff would come and pound on the door and yell at us to open up, and honestly it wasn't at all traumatizing."
"3154","I can't believe they actually need these in America😯"
"3155","Yeah, the teachers at my school went through the same training. None of the students were involved, thank God. It would've made me a complete wreck.."
"3156","I guess my nerf gun is useful😂"
"3157","-_- scared of scaring them? Isn't that the point? I thought we want to get them over so they can think and not get shot for real."
"3158","Or maybe just make gun laws stricter? Just a thought..."

"3163","stab them with a pencil if u have to, a stapler, anything that would hurt them."
"3164","That isn't even what smart school shooter would do, you want to see a school shooting can be like? I'll show you, keep an eye on the news on Wednesday September the 7th kids, rip children"
"3165","the guy is not even resisting 10%... its like a 1% resist effort he could easily switch hands and quickly pop that teacher, or discharge his gun which will probably create more panic and it could distract the teacher"
"3166","welcome to columbine highschool musical"
"3167","Yeah but something as instant as a plan crashing into a buliding and stuff is pretty too unfortunate and very unexpected. It's not like you really have much time to do anything especially if you are at high level. Unless they knew a terriost attack was going to happened that is another story maybe?"
"3168","Waht"

"3172","what happens when the officer dies?"
"3173","+Maximum Airsoft No, it doesn't. But to me, people are what puts stress on me the most. 
Teachers are not perfect, they can snap too. No amount of training can help that. I just don't understand why you would give a teacher under stress a gun when you almost always have officers in the building. Nothing is stopping a teacher from being a horrible person."
"3174","doesnt have to be people that put stress on them"

"3184","+Zelda_Freak_2002 SuperWhoLock TheLastRose but let's say each student is ""safe"" in their classroom locked door and everything. But the shooter is smart and has enough arsenal to break in. 20-30 students in a class. If he broke in he could get 60% if the kids even higher. Now add that to people probably stuck in other classrooms and populated areas like the gyms, locker rooms, cafeteria ect. Now compare that If 200 kids came plowing out of the school all different directions. Could a single shooter get them all? Probably not."
"3185","+Happy81555 the problem with everyone running out is that the shooter could easily shoot a lot of people if you're in one place"
"3186","Same. I doubt my school would be organised if someone like that happened. We would all me running xD"
"3187","+Stefan Teunissen Banning guns won't help Americans, mate. Everyone who isn't from the US thinks it will because those countries don't get nearly as many terrorist attacks as the US does. Who's to say every single person will turn in their guns anyway? It's not going to happen, and if it does, it will put the USA in an even worse position than now."
"3188","+Eric Tylki It's about the ratio's though. NYC metropolitan area and the netherlands have almost the same amount of residents and almost the same amount of surface. 
NYC metropolitan area - guns legal with permit: at least 1 shooting that I could quickly find in the last 7 years.
NL - guns illegal: No shootings in the last 7 years."
"3189","The Netherlands has less people with the New York City Metropolitan Area, and does not have the social, and crime problems as well as the abundance of guns we have already. Banning guns rather then just regulating and controlling them would have a similar result as the war on drugs."
"3190","+Eric Tylki The Netherlands. And I have to correct myself; 0 school shootings in the last 10 years. The last one was in 2004."

"3213","mate guns are to kill the killers you see in creepy ass videos. personally i dont ever carry a gun because my family is against that. and i dont carry knives or hammers or saws etc. because my family doesnt want me dirtying their stuff. also i cant kill a killer on the spot or else he might haunt the place, so i have to lure him out of the neighborhood and try to finish him off there most likely 1 on 1 with no weapon. im totally fine with that though, most people aren't that good at fighting and i keep myself to a high standard. should be good. dont plan on giving up either."
"3214","at my school if it happens in gym the gym teacher says ""Run away, through 5 exits or go into the rooms and I'll run around and lock them if we have equipment out throw it at them."" I'm like IF THEY COME THROUGH THEIR AND WE GOT DODGEBALLS IMMA MAKE THEM SAY MAI BALLLLLLLLLLLLS XD"
"3215","yeah but there are slot of kids there though it's not only you in the class room."
"3216","You could break a chair leg  if it wooden :/ I  would just give a teacher a gun with no PTSD or depression or anger disorders and make him take a test on how he's life is going once a month and if something horrible happens in his life like he gets a divorce you give it to another teacher"

So if they teach them how the defence works they will only be more effective killing..."
"3250","This is too much for the kids"
"3251","u guys know when a drill like this nobody is quiet were always laughing and being lound asf"
"3252","Tbh sometimes we laugh because of the awkward silence or someone those something stupid 
Plus all that happens is a knock on the door and checking that the doors r locked"
"3253","Wait, why didn't they email the parents?"
"3254","if i saw my teacher trying to take the shooter down i would jump in cuz i mean its better then just sitting there asking to get shot"
"3255","You know your countries fucked when you have to do this"
"3256","Would you rather put your faith in a crazed shooter, or put your faith in yourself and try to fight back? I would fight, even if I died, I would have died anyways, might as well put up a fight."
"3257","In my school the teacher isn't calm she's she LITERALLY SCREAMS SHE JUST LIKE GET TO THE BACK AND SHUT UP and everyone laughs"
"3258","I just gonna say it, locking the door and hiding in the corner isn't going to stop a shooter from killing them, I would do everything I can to stop that shooter"
"3259","lol that takedown is laughable you pretty much give the attacker your back when you take them to the ground. that like jumping into a wood chipper for safety."

"3269","Oh boy lets go hide in the corner in plain sight so the shooter can se us as soon as he walks in because that's totally smart."
"3270","I personally don't understand lockdown drills. Okay, there's a guy with a gun outside, let's say ""lockdown"" over the intercom, turn of the lights and put paper over the window at 11:00 A.M on a week day, they won't know we're here!"
"3271","The longest lockdown we've had was an hour. Someone threatened to bomb the school. Let's say I was scared as shit"
"3272","I wish my school did this"
"3273","Fucking idiots, normally they plan their massacre 1 year before (like the one at Columbine high school) and also if u practice these drills, shooters might also be students and will know what you guys have planned for when they start killing. THEY WILL PLAN WHAT TO DO !"
"3274","The drills are so stupid, honestly."
"3275","we have created a new way to survive a active shooter we never try to fix how it happens and try to stop it before happens"
"3276","Especially when all are laughing and cheering while doing the drill, wtf is this kinda bullshit they should take this seriously af in America then. Start preventing and not defending"
"3277","Gun control. When will we get it through all of our brains that all we need to fix this goddamn problem is fucking gun control. I do not care if it's a constitutional right, rules are always changing. There's proof that this works, countries who have gun control don't have mass shootings. It's that fucking simple. We need to stop teaching our children to not be killed but rather to not kill. This is why I hate living in America."

"3375","So the lady did managed to bring down the pretend shooter, but if she were to have kids in the classroom she would have shot a few of her students because the gunman would have continued on firing his weapon even as she takes him down. You always need to try to get hold of the weapon so that others around you aren't in harms way. If this was real three students would be either dead or seriously injured. This is bad training. Also teachers shouldn't have to be trained in hand to hand combat. The school should hire more security. Now this would be great against an attack wielding a knife, but not a gun. We need to give our regular cops more training to deal with these nut job shooters out there."

"3397","Video soon, sub and like please"
"3398","These practices are nothing compared to real life. Or when rumours of someone shooting up the school, even being spread by teachers and the news but the school decided to continue its daily schedule. Its terrifying. They decided the threats of our school being shot up, the 100 officers paroling outside the school and the many other students sitting in the hallways sobbing wasn't more important than our math lessons. By the end of the day our student body of 1,000 went down to just under 400 because of people straight up walking out of the school or having their parents picking them up. It was ridiculous."
"3399","I hate niggers yup"
"3400","I think it's kinda stupid because now the shooters know how the drill works and how to exploit it"
"3401","Mann y'all are sum pussies mah"
"3402","why they hide in a corner? they need to barricade the door and break the window with all force and run"
"3403","For fuck sake ban guns already"
"3404","YEAH! Lets give our students PTSD on mass scale over nothing! Fucking idiots...

ALso when it comes to practical take down training they are doing it awfully wrong... they are not teaching their students the power of a bite. If you wish to disarm a shooter who is 50+ LBS heavier than you, your best bet is to bite the arm holding the gun. Unless you are willing to go primal, the prospect of successful disarming is slim to none."
"3405","They used to teach us to throw shoes at any possible shoes when I was at school."
"3406","Fuck hiding behind a desk😂 if I hear a gunshot I'm throwing a chair out the window and I'm out that bitch😂"
"3407","The cringe .."
"3408","that's why it's called a drill...the shooter won't warn you..."
"3409","What if a school shooter watches this huh then were all fucked"
"3410","columbine ftw"
"3411","Why is this in my recommend? 😂"
"3412","We need more male teachers just in case that female can't protect us"
"3413","It'd be fun to play the gunman in those drills lol"
"3414","I don't understand how huddling close together in a corner helps whatsoever.. And the shooter would obviously know they were there if it's on a school day"
"3415","They should do these drills at every school"
"3416","i dont think mass shootings happen iften enough for them ti have a drill"
"3417","Only in America do they have shooting drills lmao."
"3418","daum it why didnt they kill all of the kids"
"3419","Cringe"
"3420","I had a real lockdown when I was in 2nd grade. My friend was right next to me and crying and I was like ""okay.. whatever."" The scariest part was when my school found out that the ""school shooter"" was from the highschool next to us. it was fucking scary though"
"3421","Eric Harris,Dylan Klebold ♥♥♥"
"3422","i thought the drill was super smart."
"3423","If only teachers were permitted to carry guns, then they would actually have a chance of defending themselves."
"3424","The regular drills dont help because kids dont take it seriously enough they think its a game im kinda glad the police near tampa did that"
"3425","What would you do if it was Kim Jong own with a bomb?"
"3426","pretty sure the guy would bang her with the gun on the head or shoot her"
"3427","Why do they even need those drills, in many countries there is no need, because wappon laws are strickter"
"3428","I like this plan better than being a sitting duck."
"3429","Or just ban guns"
"3430","u know America is fucked when they have school shooting drills wtf"
"3431","everyone at Mt school would die because they can't shut the fuck up"
"3432","these are actually a good thimg. yeah they'll get scared but they gotta deal with it because it's a real threat"
"3433","This is fucked up if you're not putting fear into society you're now putting fear into children as well. America is a fucked up nation."
"3434","They all would of died lol. None of those officers even fought back. That officer would have punch that girls in the vagina and killed everyone. Only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun"
"3435","Murica"
"3436","They don't provide any solution to show how to survive an event like this. They just exploit and traumatize children with no end to the (unjustified) means."
"3437","I wish my teacher would let us smack the shooter into our desks and probably kill him"
"3438","Wtf if someone's about to kill me and my friends in class I'm getting the fire extinguisher and getting near the door and hitting him when he gets in"
"3439","They need this shit in my school. All these kids think it's funny to fuck around during drills. I don't wanna die cause of those fuckers!"
"3440","The solution is to have faculty loaded with 12 gauge shotguns. Oh you want to be a shooter in a school? Get your ass blasted within 30 seconds. This will dramatically lower gun violence when they now realize they ARE stoppable and can be shot very easily"
"3441","I am for fight option but lets get real in situation like that no kid wants to go first and get shot and if no one goes first no one will go and stay laying on floor and maybe be alive but if you stand up and go first even if everyone follows u u are going to certain death and no kid wants that."
"3442","this is why I live in Canada"
"3443","yes. because i definitely have been in a classroom with 1,000 tennis balls 😂                                           (stolen)"
"3444","Why are they crowding everyone in one corner? they are virtually rounding them up for the shooter, it would be better to spread out across the class and for any adult in the room to position themselves by the main enterence to the room, ready to tackle anyone that walks through the door."
"3445","I went to a school near skyview and columbine, but we never did that."
"3446","In my school no one is quit there laughing and joking around.


That's good there was no shooting in my school my goose woulda been cooked."
"3447","This is fear mongering bullshit.."
"3448","I'm from the UK and I have a genuine fear of america"
"3449","Its one thing to know how to fight 
And another to have the courage to fight"
"3450","it is so sad that schools even have to prepare for this, like what is wrong with people"
"3451","Why the fuck does a 7th grader have a smart phone??"
"3452","What protects people more is the teachers right to carry a firearm!"
"3453","wow I love a walking distance from SkyView and I didn't know they did this"
"3454","wish my school did this"
"3455","i dont understand why they teach us to hide! the rule should be, if there is a window or door in your class then jump the f out. i dont understand why they teach us to sit and wait to get killed. we arnt fooling the killer by pretending we arnt there. they arnt stupid, they no we are in the classrooms. we had a lock down in school once and there was a door to the outside in my class and instead of listening to the teacher i ran tf out"
"3456","pratice:teacher turns over trainer
real life:shot threw the heart and to blame"
"3457","If there was really an active shooter everybody in my class would die because they don't know how to shut up."
"3458","Yeah lets all just curl up in the corner of the classroom so the shooter can kill us together"
"3459","then theres us in the uk who dont need any drills for stuff like this, only fire drills. thank god i dont like in 'the land of the free'"
"3460","this video is so fucked............
""is the 100 pound student or teacher going to be able to take down the 200 pound gunmen""
1. student/teacher could be 350 pounds
2. gunmen could be 50 pounds
3. yes, it's called a jointlock
""lets stop rehearsing our deaths and start screaming""
okay lets stop preparing, and sit there and scream until we die. 
what. the fuck. there a countless things wrong with this fucking video"
"3461","why would a school do this to kids? i wanna make a cop be scared of me from doing that. i will do the same thing but with an ar 15 shooting at the walls"
"3462","why the hell would you go and try and save your kid if there is an active shooter you would get killed and so would your kid you might give away the children's hiding place"
"3463","but isn't there useilly 2 or 3 gunmen"
"3464","This is incredible"
"3465","so glad i never had to do this 
because i live in a civilized country with gun laws"
"3466","you are actually mentally handicapped if you think gun control is a good idea"
"3467","What if it's a group of people what is the teacher gonna do then?"
"3468","With that gun aiming everywhere while she's fighting he could kill kids"
"3469","At my school in New Zealand, we don't even have people come through, we just have a bell and hide in the middle of the room for some fucking reason, and the bell stays on because it's apparently supposed to annoy the shooter but what ever lol we haven't had any drills or lockdowns for the two years I've been in high school"
"3470","in a lockdown your not supposed to be on your phone and this is simulating a real life death situation"
"3471","just build a wall around the schools, problem solved"
"3472","This makes me want to cry so bad. The fact that they have drills shows that America has a gun problem, yet many deny. This is such an oddity to me living in England."
"3473","they should definitely do drills, its a reality now, but huddling behind desk isn't realistic. for God sakes its not a tornado drill"
"3474","+Ty Pallotta wtf is wrong with you, sick twisted fuck"
"3475","+lucy greenaway Once again, ""+cablemanization thankyou!! finally not a complete retard in this comment section"" stop trying so hard. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about."
"3476","+Ty Pallotta jesus christ there is no need to be so rude!! i gave my opinion, its a topic i have knowledge on already so i commented my thoughts, you have your opinion and that is fine to i respect that but forcing it down other peoples throats, thats something not many people in this world today respect so i suggest you change your attitude towards others because it will come back to bite you in the ass someday, and as to my ""retard"" comment if you read all of the comments you would see i got called a retard by a lovely guy who couldn't even spell retard so it was just some shade i threw back at him."
"3477","+lucy greenaway Everyone give this girl a good round of applause. She got an A on a very opinion-based report with her ""factual"" evidence. The report that was graded by people who don't even live in the US! Let's face the fact that the guns are already out there, *no* *one* is going to turn them in if the law changes. Crime rate is lowered where guns can be openly carried, and that's the solution to the United State's problem. The citizens of the US are not going to allow the banishment of guns, so stop talking about it. 
 FYI, you're calling everyone in this section of the comments ""retard"", and you just called people here violent. Great job. 
 ""+cablemanization thankyou!! finally not a complete retard in this comment section"""
"3478","+Ty Pallotta i didn't call anyone a bunch of shit for starters and i do know what I'm talking about as i wrote a report of it for school and got an A* FYI, I've had to fully research both sides of this ongoing argument and  my opinion is backed up with facts and evidence, I'm more than happy to have a friendly debate about the situation but when it turns nasty then well that just further proves my point that violent people shouldn't be allowed violent weapons"
"3479","and goes on shooting people"
"3480","My fucking god not all of us "
"3481","yes, because the solution to mass shootings is to have more guns. my fucking god americans are brain dead"
"3482","+Knifflig any kid could just grab the gun and shoot up the school"
"3483","+Captain Joeking you cared enough to reply,and you seem pretty mad too"
"3484","yeah, what if a teacher goes crazy and decided to kill EVERY kid in the class/school before cops show?"
"3485","+RaVAGE -34 better to scatter than to huddle in a corner and everybody gets mowed down"
"3486","what if the door is pull to open????"
"3487","shooters could be outside.."
"3488","In my school, the windows are built from very strong material that it would take a few gunshots to take it down so the window would not be an option. Unless we open the window which I don't know if our windows open."
"3489","+Ty Pallotta (ManiacalMandalorian) I'm Turkish and Scottish but me and my parents were born in Australia not related to British at all. I'm not talking about terrorist  attacks."
"3490","+Ridiculous Naming How *dare* you say something like that on the internet behind your little screen. You don't even *know* what it's like to lose family to terrorist attacks because you live in fucking ""Australia the Great"". We have guns because it is the law, and we fought for that right. You came from Great Britain where you were handed everything. There are Americans who are proud to be Americans because we came from nothing! Guns CANNOT be banned in the US because they're already out there, *no* *one* will turn them in."
"3491","+toop tøp the foot føt No, I thought it was legal."

"3503","CANADA also has these drills and we have a PROHIBITION on guns"
"3504","+Maria Farid there is shooting drills in canada wtf I live in canada"
"3505","I would seal the lock, and just bust out of the room (force the door open) once safe. Only a few thousand dollars that my school could afford"
"3506","Damn"
"3507","There was a drill of people with guns in my school NOBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP so miss opened the door and said this is what it's like if u talk🔫"

If I die cause of their BS I want my grave to read ""Shoutout to my principle, she's the reason I'm here"""
"3514","because you know, the school shooter (presumably a student) is going to se an empty classroom during the middle of the day and think its legit. america sometimes xxd"

"3516","Everyone dies because there isn't a plan B."
"3517","sooo true 😂😂😂"

"3520","+Ap0llo yikes, I think you better look into that stat boy"
"3521","+Juan Pablo fuck off dude"
"3522","Maybe because america is 70%+ white and the chance of an ethnic minority shooter is a lot lower."
"3523","No it just depends honestly if there is more than one they're fucked"
"3524","correction: unbilievable, kids have to fear a man coming to their school and killing them.
This is just, wow."
"3525","+Follow Through I don't ever remember that happening in England - it's just the USA - look outside your box"
"3526","+Jester KatXD there is something called police here in europe. they actually do something useful here instead of beating up black people"
"3527","+TheWhisperingPeter actually i have never been even close to violance related with guns at all so i think that these stupid ""gun laws"" aren't even that bad"
"3528","Omg I would've actually cried"
"3529","Duck and Cover was bullshit too. These kids need to be trained to take cover until the room is breached. Once an assailant enters the room, the trained response should be group tackle. Don't cower the like ducks."
"3530","Imagine if an actual shooter came in during the drills"
"3531","It's just a prank bro"
"3532","At my school they tell us to fight the shooter"

"3536","I like this holly chick"
"3537","oh, we only sat in the corner......"
"3538","""he was doing 130"" gave me a good laugh!!!!! 🤓😂"
"3539","some kids at my school have a plan that includes me. I'm extremely light and I'm in the 9th grade I only weigh about 70 pounds. but the plan is to put me in the roof and crawl and look for the shooter and drop down on him. I'm not sure what I would do to try to get his gun out of his hand but it might help if there is ever a shooting"
"3540","I'd love a school drill like that but if I knew it was going happen"
"3541","sit in the corner and wait to be shot yeah great plan"
"3542","HIDING IN A CORNER WILL KEEP US SAFE!!!"
"3543","america sucks, just saying"
"3544","I am a middle school student and I feel if my teachers had training like this I would feel much safer in my school community and I believe all the other kids would feel safer too"
"3545","In Britain you'd of been shot on sight"
"3546","I was weak"
"3547","God damn white kids"
"3548","130 in what?"
"3549","Fucking Americans"
"3550","sad how america actually has to do this stuff"
"3551","At school it was just people sitting on the ground playing on their phones"
"3552","oh america"
"3553","'He was going 130' 😂 never heard so much bs"
"3554","What if they get used to it and as a joke one yells out OVER HERE and actually alerts a real shooter."
"3555","I really agree with this if they let the kids know and parents know ahead of time that it's a drill... 
Like send home letters with a date and go over the drill before it gets too much for the kids first I don't think in elementary schools really but most definitely high school students"
"3556","Man that's cool"
"3557","Open the window and jump. Would suck to be on the 2nd or 3rd floor though."
"3558","So cringeworthy"
"3559","""my husband almost got a ticket coming over here the other day. he was doing 130""
ok bitch for 1, ur not even supposed to drive to a school shooting unless ur actually trying to be shot or blown up??? like duh. 
2. why tf would ur husband put himself AND ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD in danger just for his useless little boy who would have probably already been dead if it was a real shooting 
3. I called the cops bc u broke the fucking law"
"3560","It's so scary because my classmates they laugh"
"3561","0:54 that kid doe rip"
"3562","""Lock down drills are as common as fire drills""
Atlas not for my school, (Which Btw it's on Fort Meade)
Fire drill= Once a week"
"3563","Schools be like oh there's a guy with a gun lets all get as close as we can to each other"
"3564","This school should be band"
"3565","Drills=Good Idea Drills That Make Students collect in one area and stay still= Srsly man, like thats worst then walking out into the halls when there is a shooter around"
"3566","Now the shooters know what to expect, well done. :("
"3567","school shooting drill is that real lmao"
"3568","my school does this"
"3569","Why the fuck am I'm watching this?"
"3570","Lol whats locking the door and closing the shade gonna do it ain't gonna do jack shit the shooter knows the classrooms filled so whatever door he gets to be prepared for the worst"
"3571","What the fuck is a shade going to do"
"3572","and in all the lock down drills we lock the drill"
"3573","then in music we go in the corner and cover the windows"
"3574","and in art we get in behind the teachers desk and they cover the windows"
"3575","its also scares me too when we are P.E we have to go to the bathroom and they separate the girls and boys into their restrooms and we lock the doors because the gym is to big to lock all the doors"
"3576","That's smart. Cramp them all together to make an easy target for him"
"3577","*blesses own soul for living in Australia*"
"3578","Um This Video Is Teaching The School Shooter Of a What The Plans The School Is Going To Do"
"3579","once we had a drill. and these girls were acting up and I stood up and said ""HEY DO YOU WANNA SEE YOUR MAMA TONIGHT? DO YOU WANNA DIE? NO? THEN SHUT UP"" and the class got Really quiet. lmaoo I don't play I'm not gonna die just bc dome foolish girls wanna laugh and makes jokes uh uh hunny"
"3580","Once my school had an unannounced lockdown drill and this kid had a phone in his backpack. When all of my classmates sat in the floor his mom called him out of worry because there was a school post on the PTA website and the ""dat boi"" ringtone played in full volume. I love my school."
"3581","If there's a shooter in my school I'm getting out of there, fuck duck and cover"
"3582","Who agrees (👍 if you agree"
"3583","But what happens if the shooter has 2 guns and grabs the gun in his pocket and shoot the person trying to disarm them?"
"3584","This is smart to do but you could just buy a door that can not be broken into by a raiding ram 1500 pounds of force so shooter can't get in am I the only one who saw a video with a door like that and glass wouldn't break bullet proof"
"3585","I think these drills are important, but not having too many unannounced ones may make the children take it not as seriously if it were a real one."
"3586","In my class or maybe the whole school, when ever there is a drill, they always take it as a joke, what happend while the lockdown, comes a real shooter"
"3587","One time we were doing a practice drill is there was an intruder in our school, and in one of the boys dorms, there was a break in. I heard that it was kids from another school trying to best up these kids from our school. Good thing we had a practice drill that time."
"3588","never tell your parents to come to school because you are putting them in danger too"
"3589","I'm so happy I don't live in America, I WOULD BE SO SCARED! Tbh I would be OK with it if i got to be a dead body tho"
"3590","I go to school in America and we had he same thing happen w police guns and stuff and they would bang on the door and say IM COMMING.  I'm in 7th grade and the police came in and my teacher made us throw tennis balls at them. It was funny tbh"
"3591","At our safety drills, we used to have the 2 biggest people, like line-backer status and they pick up the desk and charge the shooter if he got in."
"3592","like in iran"
"3593","forget drills teachers shoulx have guns."
"3594","if a shooter watches this. he knows where the kids gonna be"
"3595","wwe"
"3596","our teachers do the drills like that for them, but the ""shooter"" in the building doesn't tell anything they just walk through the hallways and we evacuate if they're far enough away and not if they're close of course but
 its pretty sad we have to do them
and everyone makes a joke out of them when we do"
"3597","At my school, we aren't told that there will be a lock down drill. We just get a man's voice over the intercom saying ""attention attention this campus is in lockdown"" on repeat. We don't know if it's a drill or not. We stay crouched in a corner for up to 30 minutes just waiting. Certain teachers tell you to grab objects that can be used as weapons."
"3598","I find the whole huddle up in a corner thing stupid because, it's basically a giant sitting duck, making it even easier to shoot everyone"
"3599","My mom told me to play dead and smear blood on myself, so they will think I'm already dead and ignore me"
"3600","sad that they train them to all be victims."
"3601","The sad part is in a real life situation most of these people will run, hide and forget what they were taught... for those that remember what they were taught they will most likely get gunned down before they get close enough to even try one of these tactics"
"3602","These drills are awesome. Give the shooter a lesson in how the teachers will react..."
"3603","you fight a gunman and u gonna have 5 bullets in yo stomach"
"3604","false flags"
"3605","just a prank kids"
"3606","these school shooters are almost as happy as my killer was"
"3607","Of course it was Florida tho"
"3608","ID LEGIT CLIMB THE CABNIT AND GO IN THE CEILING WITH THE FOAM STUFF"
"3609","wow usa's gun laws are so fucking stupid."
"3610","I support the preperation training incase a school shooting occurs. But it is probably more likely a student will end up shooting (such as columbine). If school systems took bullying, bad stuff, etc more seriously and did stuff more efficiently to prevent these things, there probably wouldn't be as much school shootings as there is."

"3618","Americans take things to the extremes."
"3619","if a school shooter came to my school into my class I would be like fuck no I'm out Run like using bolt"
"3620","If someone with a gun comes on the campus I'm throwing a desk at the window and jumping the fence tf"
"3621","Boi, if there is a lockdown, I'm jumping out that window and running all the way to China"
"3622","Live in England. Can't relate."
"3623","Where's chadtronic?"
"3624","If someone is pointing a gun at you what have you got to loose by fighting back? 
chances are if you are cornered in a classroom and a gunman enters your a target and he's not going to just walk out without firing off a few rounds. 
you actually increase your chances by a group attack he will be taken by suprise"
"3625","I can make this hit 700 dislikes but nahhh"
"3626","hell i would be gone. I'm not black for nothing 😂😂😂😂"
"3627","or have tons of security guards with guns in the schools"

"3636","+Justin Hornbeck lol he is right dude 70 lbs is like nothing if you don't know the height"
"3637","Why wouldn't you teach the students to take down a shooter. Lol."
"3638","what kind of music will they make"
"3639","just because you dont in america, this can still happen to you"
"3640","+RileyIsAwesome87 There was a school shooting up here a few months ago."
"3641","It doesn't matter where you live. You never know who is going to do what at what place."
"3642","in canada we have lock down drills but hardly ever, like once every other year"
"3643","its just a joke chilll out"
"3644","im kidding"
"3645","+ZeMiner12 HAHAHAHHAH"
"3646","Dude no wonder you had a lockdown people thought you were breaking into the school because it was Saturday"
"3647","Shits*"
"3648","or just give the damn teachers guns"
"3649","We are living in a fucked world"
"3650","that big muscle dude would destroy that teacher. She grabs one arm and can barely handle the one.... he could probably lift her up with one arm and do some hammer smashes with the other hand... I get the point of the drill but they should put some protective gear on them and go full speed and see if you could do it for real or get killed. (drill tho)"
"3651","Ahahahah

When the kids went calmly to the corner and the teacher was really nice

Our teacher is like ""SIT YO ASS IN THE CORNER""

And we all panic and start a stampede to the corner"
"3652","Most school shootings are by teenage kids,not random 200lb men who decide to shoot up a school (not saying it doesnt happen,but its mostly shootings by kids),so tackling will bring a teenage kid down,especially if hes not expecting it. Why huddle in a corner n wait to get shot? Wait by the damn door and pounce wen he comes in,like the teachers did at the end."
"3653","I don't care wtf the rest of my class does Ima break a fuckin window and get my ass outa there I ain't about to just sit there and get ready to die"
"3654","im preety sure it should be called suicide drill. a school shooter wants to kill not hold hostages yet they tell you to to sit in a corner and be a target *clap clap clap*
only in america"
"3655","Fuck tennis balls just teach the kids or teachers how to kill a cunt with a pair of scissors"
"3656","Lol back in like 3rd grade I always thought lockdowns were fun....the drills, of course. Not the real ones.
And there was even one on my birthday that year lol."
"3657","Just watch how useful the teacher on the left is at 7:55"
"3658","i remember being on lock down for two hours (real lock down) bad memories"
"3659","Give them a gun to kill the intruder"
"3660","holly carpenter is the one who survived the columbine library shooting, she should be lucky to be alive"
"3661","Bang bang lmao"
"3662","watch YouTube take this vid down just cause it says school shooting in it haha"
"3663","That one moment when the teacher tells you to blockade the door but it's a pull to open"
"3664","My science teacher tells us to hide in the closet and in the cabinets. She also has a clipboard that is secretly a weapon"
"3665","won't the kids think its a drill and not real because they get used to it"
"3666","lol they don't have this shit at my high school. fake dead bodies xD wtf"
"3667","What a shit country."
"3668","Bad Form at the end u should just strait up tackle them then disarm them so u have more power and do it fast so they can't react"
"3669","where there are more guns, there is less crime"
"3670","Last time my country had something like this, the Americans took back their country."
"3671","thank God I don't live in shitty America"
"3672","at my school the teachers have to stand right at the door"
"3673","Fight like that against a gunman and have fun getting knocked out and killed"
"3674","I like that all of them sit in one corner do its easier to just spray down them. Many school shooters are students, IF they know How they hide and do everything its just useless."
"3675","This is amazing ! 💜💜"
"3676","If it's in high school or middle school all of the students should charge the shooter and end him"
"3677","Its fucking sad that we even have to prepare for something like this."
"3678","None of this shit is going to work. Especially that method of everyone throwing shit at the shooter. That 100lb teacher trying to take down that 200+lb guy is just sad. The guy was resisting but obviously not giving it his all. A real shooter would be ruthless. My suggestion is to have gun training as a requirement to work at a school, so if the shooter comes into the class, the teacher could just shoot the guy. Yeah it may traumatize the students but it's better than having a bunch of them murdered."
"3679","Anyone notice that he was carrying a Glock type hand with an extended mag?  This is an example of how gun control doesn't work. Please don't say ""he was using a thirty round mag so he can go to all the classrooms. Criminals don't follow the rules/laws so what makes you think that stricter gun control will stop them from obtaining or follow the gun codes? Criminals don't think twice when they are going to commit a firearm related crime, but if everyone was armed they would have to think twice knowing they can face the threat of an armed civilian. I agree what with Israel did with their country. They armed their teachers and school shootings went down."
"3680","Why is this in my recommended?"
"3681","In my school we just continue to get education and don't have to waste our time on drills like this because our government aren't stupid like yours"
"3682","I dont think i can even survive a furnace"
"3683","An unannounced drill is better, that way everyone takes it seriously. I mean how often have you been in a class for a lockdown drill and you hear people talking and shit? If you practice like it's real when the real shit happens they will know what needs to be done.

Also huddling in a corner is stupid, it makes you an easier target. If you are spread out, but away from the access points you have a better chance of surviving. Most simply because the shooter has to worry about multiple groups that could attack them, he shoots at 1 group and the others can attack, guns don't shoot 2 ways.

Also arm yourself, whether it be a pencil or a hammer, you will have a better chance if  it comes to combat. Remember that even a soda can can kill a person if you know how to use it.

The whole sit in the corner and wait to die approach sickens me. I would rather go out trying to save lives than got out sitting in a corner cowering. Of course that is probably the firefighter and mountain biker in me, wanting to help others and keep going until my body can't physically go anymore."
"3684","it's so fucking sad that they have to practice drills like these as often as fire drills smh"
"3685","I know this is a safety drill but common that's weak... Barricade the door!! While he's trying to open the door he's running of time cause there's police coming😐"
"3686","This is also teaching future school shooters how to plan their attack. Which will result in more deaths."
"3687","I think the defense mechanism they're teaching the teachers is great. Instead of lying down and letting 20, 50, even 100 kids get shot like nothing they could reduce that by using their body weight to pin someone down.
Also, go for weak spots such as the groin, the sides, the head, and the back of the knees."
"3688","Lmao I told my friends don't mess with me I'm a certified school shooter"
"3689","Cool, I hope this happens to my school xD"
"3690","We teach our children that violence is not the answer but never prepare themselves for that moment when violence is the only answer"
"3691","This is fucking terrible I swear they was acting like it was a damn joke"
"3692","Can't the shooter shoot the lock off then bust open the door and kill all the kids huddled in the corner?




This is the bullshit nobody thinks about, the school should be evacuated thru the classroom Windows, not just siting in a corner and waiting inside"
"3693","we need this"
"3694","Im happy I live in London :D"
"3695","They should do a tornado drill where the   Teachers come in with huge fans and fake foam debris"
"3696","Lowkey the teacher cute"
"3697","or why don't they just lock the door and if that's not possible then cover it with chairs giving the shooter a time to Get in"
"3698","When we have our drill I'm in band so our band teacher says if they beak in play ur instruments and squeak and bust there ear drums 😂"
"3699","only in america"
"3700","I live in England, I don't have this kind of shit in my school. You Americans are the only ones that need this."
"3701","99% of people are like: i would jump on him. i say shut up. IRL you would never do that"
"3702","scary"
"3703","what would you do then"
"3704","Why not invest in some sort of barricade that isolates the classrooms???"
"3705","""Oh I was scared"" faggets"
"3706","At my school if there is a shooting we hide in the corner you can't see from the door. The teachers put a green or red slip of paper under the door to make sure their class is accounted for, and our safety squad (really brave teachers) goes around and looks for green ,if red the search. It's never happened and I have had 1 drill in 7 years."
"3707","how pathetic is it that this even has to even be taught.. Just shows the tragic state you guys have gotten yourself in to where your own children fear for their lives everytime they go to school.. How sad"
"3708","at my school during the lock down drill they purposely set off the fire alarm"
"3709","The teachers should not be practising to take down a shooter cause there gonna get shot it's not the teachers have the correct training"
"3710","Guys Pray 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😘😘😘"
"3711","My school is what my district calls a ""Blue and Green Ribbon school"" meaning that my school is one of the best educated and well defined in the state, yet, all we do is sit in a corner like sitting ducks and wait for it to be over. Real smart."
"3712","should train them to barricade doors with shelves and desks"
"3713","clickbait, stop trying to get views on your shitty wrestling match"
"3714","we would have 50 minute lockdown drills.."
"3715","My school is stupid as fuck, all they do is shut off the lights and lock the front door."
"3716","No I think it's better if they don't tell us it's a drill so we are actually fear for are life and understand that if this happens for real we are ready I go to a school where there heave been a stabbing and know they are more secureity"
"3717","MURRICA!!!!!!!"
"3718","Am I the only one who's school does the Alice thing ?"
"3719","And that's how Yandere Simulator teachers are so strong."
"3720","All the white kids be shooting up da school"
"3721","WTF,in my school we have metal bats and we standing right beside the door and wait until the intruder comes in and then we hit the intruder's wrist where he is holding the gun and then we all start hitting him/her with the bats lol.."
"3722","I support this 100% if it is always announced as a drill."
"3723","I hate when parents first reaction is to drive to the school. I understand your child is in great danger I really do but what are you going to do when you get there. I had a 4 hour legit lockdown last year and every god damn parent was at our school and clogging up all of the entrances points onto the school campus were their cars, it was so bad our authority couldnt even get their vehicles onto the campus."
"3724","I'd be like gtfo just gtfo"
"3725","thats kinda crazy cus I was gonna go to jewett"
"3726","guess what you can be more nice and social to people in your class but noooo let them go psycho and come up with drills to protect them."
"3727","these americans are so god damn dumb"
"3728","lol failing at making women feel empowered, having them talk even more shit like ""id hit the shooter with tennis balls"""
"3729","if anyone were to ever walk up in my school and start shooting ima throw a mf desk at that boi like gtfo my school home boy"
"3730","FUCKING TRUMP SUPPOTER SHOOTING SCHOOLS FOR FUN"
"3731","My school said if they get close, stab them with a pencil like no lie the principal said that lmao"
"3732","i would run right out the school"
"3733","STUPID DRILL THEY NEED A NEW ONE."
"3734","I'm 12 and what is the Columbine shooting"
"3735","we dont even have drills for this😐"
"3736","Why don't they take the time to build a secret basement in like 2 parts of the building, or a secret room in every room to hide, instead of hiding under   the desk like a dumbass"
"3737","school shooting drills .... srsly ? ... is that realy a thing ?"
"3738","FUCK all of you people trynna get gun control laws! Even if we get rid of guns do you idiots really think the ""bad guys"" are going to give up their guns? You guys are fucking idiots. You guys are what's wrong with America plz go back to wherever you came from!"
"3739","Haha they have to have shooting drills in America. Another reason gun laws should be tightened?"
"3740","Stupid Americans"
"3741","Don't have these where I from :("
"3742","Good thing I went to a high school here in California where us Hispanics were the majority, almost everyone got along, hardly any bullying. It's mostly schools with white kids that have shootings and serious bullying. This is true don't deny it!"
"3743","3:50 so they don't lock the doors?"
"3744","The answer to your first question is DONT HAVE GUNS"
"3745","Thank God we Canadians are peaceful"
"3746","don't turn off the lights the shooter would think they are in there because why would the lights be off in the school in the day"
"3747","in our drill we bat up the shoterr becausd we haz skills in callz of duti, fukin batalfeld play wuld of dyed a long tyme agu"
"3748","You know how hard it is to kill someone with a throwing knife? It's next to impossible to get it to hit them in the right place and at a good enough angle to kill them, especially with scissors."
"3749","it was a simulation you goof. they weren't gonna actually throw stuff at an actor"
"3750","Multi-Kill left and rught"
"3751","lol"
"3752","LMAO😂😂😂😂"
"3753","lol"
"3754","Fuck this made me cry from laughing too hard"
"3755","dont go in the cabinets. me and some friends are gonna pick that metal shit up and wwe slam it into dat boi shooter over there."
"3756","+Eric Tomlinson but won't that get you trapped"
"3757","+Tom H im dead"
"3758","+Tom H bruh"
"3759","I mean idk, cause once we got one without warning, and we were watching something on the projector, and a 911 pop up, popped up, and it said lock down, and my teacher didn't know either until she checked her email, then again we wouldn't of known anything, but I thought it was a drill, cause like you don't expect nothing bad until it actually happens"
"3760","no,cuz theyll usually announce over the intercom ""not a drill!"" or some shit"
"3761","Better to have some deaths than everyone dying?"
"3762","+Chigozie Ibe You seem ignorant af, basically what u are saying is ""if you are a bodybuilder u cant get shot"""
"3763","+Creezi not if you are a fucking bodybuilder. just saying"
"3764","+SAMMIsLIFE IF you are hiding and just decide to jump out u are fucking stupid"
"3765","+Lewis Levy Thats what they told us. Im saying the teachers lied to us to make us feel more comfortable so we didnt expect someone to come into the school"
"3766","+Steve Johnson Citations?Probably not as much as European countries."
"3767","The fact people are pretending to be dead is outrageous! It's not preparing, it's getting kids used to it so when it's for real they aren't as mortified! GUN LAWS WORK! - Everyone from Australia"
"3768","+Max Braithwaite A dog?"
"3769","+xuxuosu You don't have to be so rude mate."
"3770","Grab a pen, stab the shooter in the throat"
"3771","Or just teach kids and the teachers to grab anything you can into a weapon and go hid near the door where he can't see them it's better than standing at the end of the class and throwing tennis balls"
"3772","true"
"3773","Everyone should join in, sure some people will be gunned down but hey...you saved more lives by paying with 1"
"3774","right"
"3775","sadly, ths is England we're talking about"
"3776","ikr"
"3777","I hope all my friends die too!"
"3778","+Shrek true asf"
"3779","+puppy67726 Gaming and I would rather attack a gunman then cower in fear and wait to die"
"3780","My school is right beside a mental hospital and we have a lot of lockdown drills"
"3781","true I would scream like a little girl"
"3782","I would at least try to fight him off."
"3783","+EthanSwag true, but irl if a shooter were at my school the least I could do would be fight for my life."
"3784","The point is studies have been done on this kind of thing and most people who say they would do something heroic usually end up running just like most people"
"3785","or*"
"3786","no, if they take him down you have the chance of people joining in and killing him or something"
"3787","same we all ded nigga 😂"
"3788","OMG this is my school, we live in Alabama 😂😂😂"
"3789","We bust the windows open and run for the highway"
"3790","wow that is what my school use to do. lol"
"3791","remind me of how many shootings happen at schools in canada"
"3792","+swatteam93 well it depends on where u  r at in the building and we also have things on the windows that if you hit them in the right place the window shaters"
"3793","+Sarah Watson Why would anyone stay and risk their lives when they're aloud to run. Just have everyone in the school go out the windows"
"3794","+Greatlittlekeely yeah r school does the Rachel thing also but r school does this program called A.L.I.C.E and its wear we r trained to attack and escape if there is a intruder in the school like it will come on the announcements that there is a intruder and we ourselfs can either choose to run out of the school or stay and fight if the intruder is to close to the room."
"3795","Is it like, how Alice was a girl killed in a school shorting? If so, we kinda of do. But we do the Rachel one."
"3796","omg 😂"
"3797","+Trevor Mikos what i didn't say anything about guns? and second as a parent im pretty sure you wont just stand around being concerned i mean i don't know about you but my parents tell me all the time that they will do anything and everything to protect me including dying for me, and with that said and in my opinion, you just staying at home only concerned about your child's safety instead of doing something, anything is just pathetic and shows to your child that you really don't care enough to attempt at the very least to save your child."
"3798","+Daniel Martinez​ As a parent I would be greatly concerned but I wont interfere with emergency services, also what does a gun in my pic do with anything? It is a hobby of fun that I enjoy very responsibly"
"3799","+Aj K who's going to better protect your kid you or the police?"
"3800","At my school, earlier this year, we had two bomb threats. We weren't allowed to have our phones out at all and we weren't allowed to communicate with anyone out of school."
"3801","well its worth a try right?"
"3802","I actually bring a knife with me in my pocket so if something happens and shit"
"3803","Only in America"
"3804","stab in the eye"
"3805","It's both."
"3806","+sushil george 13 people died actually... And it's famous, not infamous."
"3807","It happened in 1999 2 students walked in to the school and killed 19 people I'm only 11 years old so you should know about this :) it was one of the most infamous school shootings in the US"
"3808","I only have fire drills in my school."
"3809","us either if this ever happens to our school it'll be ape shit crazy"
"3810","+Anthony Cardenas I'm not picking up..."
"3811","not arguing here but ever heard of columbine? They were bullied and just average people"
"3812","+YourTinyIndian ik, just joking around"
"3813","3:49*"
"3814","Where I live we don't even have these shooting drills"
"3815","couldn't the shooter just punch them"
"3816","l think it's sad that something like that is a  normal procedure to do in schools. And who the fuck tries to defend himself against a guy with a gun. Even if the gun isn't reloaded, it hurts like hell when you get hit by it. Besides, hes got body fucking armour. You ain't gonna do shit aginst the shooter with a gun and body armor. Just sayin'..."
"3817","Bruh why would you all cluster up? Its a easy target for the perpetrator I would fucking book it to a neighborhood or near by"
"3818","in my school we can't bring our bags and we have to leave it in our locker"
"3819","I hope holly carpenter dies tomorrow"
"3820","Fucking run out the window"
"3821","why not just stop selling guns in the US. that will stop all this. the UK don't sell anything except shotguns and have no shootings"
"3822","This kids are FAAAGGOOOTS"
"3823","this is is absolutely amazing, this could save so many lives, every school needs to do this."
"3824","to be honest they would be dead if he fought back"
"3825","Only in white schools"
"3826","Get shrekt gunman"
"3827","I thought it was just a white kid"
"3828","I'm in high school and the one i go to has been open since 1955 and there's only been one real lockdown. BTW this is in canada"
"3829","how about having a few law abiding teachers with guns to defend themselves?"
"3830","Here's a tip: Don't hide under a desk and wait for the shooter to arrive, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE! (Unless you have no choice)"
"3831","These people are smart because of they get in the room what you gonna do huh"
"3832","Yes, show potential school shooters your methods of hiding. Nice."
"3833","would be a better idea to all just run at the shooter and take him down. better than sitting in a corner with no chance of defending yourself"
"3834","Oh hell nah I'm out that window bitch"
"3835","Best thing to do in my opinion is just jump out the window and Usain Bolt it. Hide in the corner my ass.if there were no windows just stack the desks upon the door and if he busts in throw chairs at him."
"3836","My school doesn't do this we barricade the doors and windows"
"3837","Fuccc if that actually at my school I'm out the window"
"3838","This is pretty cool"
"3839","think about it the one time it actually happens they will think it's a drill cause of these"
"3840","in fourth grade we were in or and a lockdown drill happened and then we went to the equipment room and a boy was given a flashlight and he held it under his face and then everybody was laughing so we basically got a F in that."
"3841","at my school back in 89 
someone called ahead and said there was gonna be a school shooting. Some of the teacher's along with a couple of Jr's n Seniors went to their cas and got their guns spent the whole day outside waiting for the shooter he never came"
"3842","Evert teacher should have a shotgun under their desk😂"
"3843","Idk wtf hiding behind desks does when someone pulls up to a class with a gun"
"3844","It's amazing parents trust their kids with a stranger they deem a 'teacher', but then don't trust their teacher with a firearm"
"3845","And people call you a conspiracy theorists when you tell them a shooting is a hoax. They just admitted to you they hire actors for drills but you refuse to believe they ever hire an actor..sheep out there! More guns=less shootings"
"3846","I'm so sick of this Morgan movie ad"
"3847","i would probably kill the shouter by mistake."
"3848","Fucking Americans"
"3849","and this is why we should have gun control, but these idiots want to keep their toys to play with and ""accidentally"" shoot someone"
"3850","Just pile shit infront of the door"
"3851","this is why teachers should get paid way more"
"3852","it's a great idea to practice but I don't see why they have easy escape routes that kids can get out he building quickly"
"3853","Perks of living in the UK: none of this bs"
"3854","This is hilarious / stupid / I can't breath lmao / yass / chill pill"
"3855","Thank God I live in Britain and no one shoots anyone"
"3856","""Just ban guns"", so why is it EVERYBODY had guns 50 years ago and school shootings were VERY rare and nowhere near as many people were killed from it?"
"3857","I had a real one. it was a living hell. our asst. supertendent saved us"
"3858","the difference between the UK and USA we have never had this the most I have done is a fire drill"
"3859","If an active shooter enters a classroom he will kill as many people as he can. The students and teachers can do nothing and die or fight back and at the very least have a chance to survive. The only way to stop an active shooter is to kill him."
"3860","I want this shit to happen in my school, the drill btw 😂, I live in the UK and if anyone in our school would hear ' School Shooting You're All Dead!' Me and my boys be pulling out BB guns and picking up chairs and shit. 😂😂"
"3861","Literally why is this even a problem, in the UK this would never happen the most youd get would be some junkie bricking a window fs just get gun control"
"3862","If there's ever a shooting in my school I'll just sit on him I'm fat enough to hold him down maximum I can hold down is about 72738848485757304847363848493847.3 poinds"
"3863","this is why school staff needs guns"
"3864","That teacher would have NEVER won that fight in real life against the guy with the gun"
"3865","The lockdown drills just scare the kids, in reality they really don't help at all because if a shooter comes in the room they're all dead anyway. The only way to prevent them being killed is to have some form of defense, whether it is armed teachers, guards, or police officers. Hiding in a corner is like hiding under your blanket because you think that you have a monster in your room. It does nothing to help and just creates more stress."
"3866","This proves that America is the best country in the world, just because they even have to practice this"
"3867","Because every school shooter dresses in full riot gear"
"3868","during drills everyones calm.but if it was real im dipping out the window bet..."
"3869","*""Things you have to learn in the US""*"
"3870","wtf that's all they do they should try blocking the doors with desks backpacks and other stuff."
"3871","once during a shooting drill a dad with a real gun came in and shot the fake shooter"
"3872","just ban fucking guns americans need to get their heads out their arses and realises a 200 year old constitution is outdated"
"3873","If you search for the 160 active shootings after columbine, half weren't even in a school, and half of that half were suicides"
"3874","why is there no harambe training"
"3875","lol"
"3876","ha😂 only in America."
"3877","6:20 his arm was free"
"3878","hide behind the door and judo chop that motherfucker"
"3879","at my school all we do is tsunami drills and earthquake drills... we dont do lock down drills"
"3880","By doing this drills, the real potential shooter would have already know all the secret."
"3881","What! You don't start an actual fire when you have a fire drill!!! Why have someone come in with a fake gun."
"3882","this is so sad they need to have these sort of drills in the US, in Australia the drill we have is for fires..."
"3883","this school is stupid your suppose to lock the door and shutoff the light so the gunman can not see you"
"3884","There's no shooting drill in Indonesia (my country of origin) nor in here (UK)."
"3885","what kind of a question is that? when u look at students, why the hell would u automatically think that some psychopath would come in and kikl them? what an asshole"
"3886","I was told to throw as much shit as you can like chairs and desks"
"3887","I feel like making a video like this is just exposure for the school and getting their name out for future school shooters"
"3888","I feel as if the students will think it is a drill if the real one happens because they are used to the fake suprise ones"
"3889","Everyone is taking the 'activities' as a joke. They are all laughing when they throw the balls at the man, but don't understand the importance of it. Even the teachers need to take it more seriously."
"3890","Im trained in martial arts"
"3891","Longest my school has ver had is 3 hours"
"3892","I think these drills are very very important for the kidd education and I get that the kids are scared but I think it's definitely needed the school I go to hasnmt done a single drill in fact all of the schools I've been to haven't so basically if it ever happened to my school they wouldn't have a plan and it would just be an one the spot thing"
"3893","Bloody hell?? Just ban the guns?? It's actually ridiculous that kids are spending time in school learning how to protect themselves from shootings. That can fuck a kid up knowing that one day someone could shoot them in school"
"3894","I live in Australia. school shootings? What school shootings?"
"3895","I'm sorry the guy still wasn't fighting back if it was real life the shooter might have a knife easily accessible to their other hand and they would be punching and elbowing and fighting a lot harder."
"3896","130 😂😂"
"3897","Yes... This is what we need. The students at Columbine just hid under the desks and died, if they had rushed the shooters, many people would have been saved"
"3898","my school last year was called skyview. Not the same school though"
"3899","at my school we don't need one because my country is not retarded"
"3900","our lock down drills are sitting in the corner and the principle tries to open the door"
"3901","But it trains police and the kids"
"3902","huddling all the kids together is stupid. the shooters wont need to waste so much ammo"
"3903","What will staying in a corner do? Especially  if they're all there just waiting to get shot all together?"
"3904","""he was going 130mph"" yea right like your honda civic could even hit 100"
"3905","I find it strange that they are all laughing and smiling during this"
"3906","At my school we've only had a lockdown drill one time which was something like 15 years ago because we don't need them in England as much as in America, but my tutor teacher says that if we do have a lockdown, that we will lock the door and the class will go into a huge cupboard in our classroom which has a back exit into the dance room which also has an exit to the outside of the school"
"3907","My school taught us to block the door with desks and chairs, and grab something to defend yourself. If you can, get out of the building and run."
"3908","What's inside?"
"3909","when my class has practice drills they are so loud we would be dead"
"3910","America is FAILING. Just elect Trump and then you will receive your official Failure badge."
"3911","Bruh when i was in 6th grade i broke my foot and we had a shooters drill where we had to run to the fucking high school and it was fucking HORRIBLE"
"3912","Huddling in the corner is a terrible idea one :he's at the door so no one escapes two:bullets can sometimes penetrate though a human body  and hit something else 





                   👏good job👏"
"3913","My school does something like this, but they prepared us for the drill and only had actors outside the door; they didn't come in the room with guns."
"3914","+Keyes and Nebbins Most likely. I agree on that."
"3915","The armor in the training was so the shooter wouldn't get hurt. Most shooters don't have armor."
"3916","+Christian Alfaro I get that, yes. But Would you go against him if you know you WILL die? Of course something will happen sooner or later. It's just the thing that with a hand gun and body armor you are nearly superior against a class.You have full protection against hits, and a metal object in your hands which will K.O you even without projectiles in it. And you're not gonna find anything to throw or punch at him before he notices your plans. Of course he might get stopped if the pupils have no fucks to be given and just charge at the attacker. But it's most likely not gonna happen."
"3917","+Aidan Fultz Yeah, but there's just one problem. No one wants to attack him first. You go first, you die first."
"3918","I'm gonna add more to my response to elaborate on why attacking the shooter is the best course of action:

The worst case scenario of trying to attack someone with a gun would be getting shot. The worst case scenario of not attempting to directly stop the shooter is a few dozen people getting shot.

Yes, the best case scenario of not dealing with the shooter himself is getting away, but a lot of people are gonna die regardless. If enough people attempt to attack the shooter back, back however, only about 10 people will die at most before enough people get through and tackle the shooter when he needs to reload.

Yes, some people will die trying, and yes, not many people will want to play hero, but you're talking about a few people sacrificing themselves to save others and themselves where they would have died anyway had they not done anything."
"3919","+NooZzleZ ""lol who cares""? Are you that fucking insensitive? By making noise you're risking the lives of everyone in the area"
"3920","+Big Time Troller (Nwpowninja) They need to get those stools with the three legs and have giant foot ball students ram the legs into the shooter with a bayonet charge."
"3921","I'd just hit the guy with a chair hide right by the door the WAPOW"
"3922","Lol who cares"
"3923","+Delin Balr lol who cares"
"3924","Cars*"
"3925","+Maymunah Muwwakkil I can see if they hid a gun somewhere where no student know or can see it or something."
"3926","Actually it would not be a smart idea wonder if a child gets a hold of it one day?"
"3927","+Rokka If we could have police in every school, that would be great. Unfortunately, with a population as big as ours, that's not very easy. "
"3928","+ThatOtherGuy // Just anotha guy Police defends citizens. The fuck is the problem in America? You guys have to defend yourselfs? Thats the only way? No police over there? ):"
"3929","+Happy81555 Have fun defending yourself with no weapons then."
"3930","+TH4BO55 Maybe because they own the most guns?????"
"3931","+TH4BO55 because crime in general is low and it's not next to Mexico"
"3932","+888nivek And Canada is right next to the US, but you don't see a lot of shootings there."
"3933","+TH4BO55 because it lives literally next to the one of the most violent drug/weapon trafficking country that is south america"
"3934","+TH4BO55 exactly"
"3935","+Brad Wright I dont really care either at this point, Britain sucks and the second ammendment will never go away. see ya later buddy, have fun getting fucked in the ass by some guy who wants to rob you and your family ;)"
"3936","Yep,but you got rapefugees to worry about,have fun."
"3937","+Chase Davidson what's your point ? I know this much, after Columbine police departments nationwide agreed that the best strategy to deal with an active shooter is to stop the shooter as soon as possible. The first 3 officers to arrive on scene will form a team and go after the active shooter. Pre-Columbibe, the strategy was to set up a perimeter and wait for SWAT. The longer it takes to stop an active shooter the more people will die.  I have never heard of of any active shooter refrain from killing people. Active shooters stop when they are disabled by others or when they kill themselves.  Regardless of how many people on average die during a school shooting it doesn't make sense to not fight back. You can sit there and take a gamble and pray the shooter doesn't kill you when he sees you or you can attack him when he walks into where you are hiding."
"3938","Do you know anything about school shootings? Almost all of them less than 10 people died"
"3939","lol so true yall would get fucked"
"3940","you and you're boys are dead then..."
"3941","+Benjamin Bursell even with gun control, people still get guns :) it will do nothing."
"3942","+Jordyn Manier AHAHAHAHAHAHA fucked that prick up"
"3943","There's gun control in Canada and a school shooting happened."
"3944","They probably would have some sort of protection"
"3945","+MangoSmango1 
That dumbass mofo"
"3946","Cuz it's fake and more realistic and a there's no way to fake a fire"
"3947","if there is an active shooter take cover and get yourself out carefully.  that's my opinion!"
"3948","yeah, i've never heard of schools doing this. I live a few towns down from newtown you'd think they'd do drills like that more around here. we just all go into one corner of the room. we had a real lockdown once a few years ago but it was just some kid who had one of those swiss army knives in their backpack."
"3949","that's like half a school day"
"3950","+Charlie Graff Same in the states bro. There is a market for everything."
"3951","umm in engladn you can get guns illegaly"
"3952","Mine was 3 minutes"
"3953","IT WAS REAL"
"3954","dont understand what people dont get about this its standard security measures just like a fire drill."
"3955","+Mr MerK some rooms will be empty and most will have kids in them but if the shooter sees all the lights off and all doors locked and its dead quite, thats why its important for everyone to stay silent, so the shooter has no idea which room is empty and which room is full."
"3956","+Wyatt Barrett you fucking moron. She's 100% correct. Literally all school shooters are fucked in the head and not thinking rationally"
"3957","+mr mister but why would he think no one is in any room isn't that suspicious for the shooter"
"3958","and i forgot to put this in the High School was like 4 miles away which was really stupid"
"3959","at my school we had one for 15 minutes one time!! It wasn't real, though"
"3960","We pack all the desks against the door in my school"
"3961","poor army public school students they were brutally killed"
"3962","This teaches kids to be afraid of there surroundings if you want to stop a school shooter you have to fight and know that there will be casualties but less then if you just sit there and let them shoot you FIGHT OR FLIGHT DO NOT STAND THERE"
"3963","YAY! let's throw tennis balls at the shooter so we can get blasted in the FACE! YASS!"
"3964","Maybe you could ban guns, or is that too smart."
"3965","i think this is stypid.. This is not any solution."
"3966","Once in my old school someone decided to make a joke and tell that there was a bomb in the building. The whole school evacuated in one minute. We were all so scared. Even the police came.  Everyone was so scared and a few kids went home after it was clear that there wasn't a bomb."
"3967","I wish these teachers would get killed in a school shooting. There is 0% chance of survival if the shooter comes in and everybody is just sitting in a group in a corner it would be like shooting sitting ducks. But there would be a chance if the teacher and the students where waiting behind the door or at it and could attack the shooter as he/she comes in :)"
"3968","they can teach this to little kids, but then cry about teaching kids about sex and homosexuals XD thats fucking retarded"
"3969","in new Zealand we have earthquake drills.."
"3970","8:03 if they have him like that ima bite his ass cheek off"
"3971","We don't do drills where I live because we have proper gun control in Britain."
"3972","That is so sick. How can you pretend there are dead people on the floor, and make them think there's an actual shooting? And then this bitch goes like : ""only the idea that someone would want to hurt these kids..."" well guess what you're doing you piece of shit. Scaring them to death preparing a nice little trauma"
"3973","the parents will be angry until it saves their kids lives"
"3974","Just buy guns teachers !!!!!!!"
"3975","A good idea might be to lock the fucking door. Look. The guy just opens it every time. If there are no locks then barricade it"
"3976","My school is so different😂.... We just hide in a corner and lock the door and the principal walks around the halls being the ""shooter"" and just knocks on the doors or tries to open the door a little bit and thats all..."
"3977","Swat members are now teaching new defense techniques. Like throwing plastic balls."
"3978","One of my friends punched a fake shooter in the face and took the gun"
"3979","If the 220lbs guy really tried he could have picked that teacher up with one arm"
"3980","Fucking retards. all going in a corner all together with no escape so fucking smart."
"3981","But if it really happens the kids wont be scared they'll its just another time they're practicing!!"
"3982","this is messed up its like pretending to sett someone on fire during a fire drill"
"3983","my ela teacher told our whole class that we were having a lockdown drill and she told us if it was real we can grab anything to defend ourselfs even staplers scissors and other things😂😂"
"3984","they call it drill . its called a prank bro !"
"3985","lol. american problems. we Europeans dont have to deal with that shit"
"3986","Good job now the shooter knows what to look out for."
"3987","I support this lol"
"3988","I would take a desk and smash it through the window, and be like see ya bitches"
"3989","But still think kids dont take a drill right"
"3990","This is why I'm happy that I live in England."
"3991","hahaha, murifats"
"3992","Sitting and waiting to be killed is the worst thing you can do in a situation like this. Students need to be trained to, as a group, take down the shooter and to escape the building."
"3993","Honestly, if you do a lot of drills without telling the students then honestly one day when there really is a shooting the kids won't take it seriously."
"3994","Sandy Hook was fake tho"
"3995","at my school they teach us to do maths and English as I live in the UK and our country isn't full of retards"
"3996","Like bitch why hide in a corner?! If he comes in its easier to kill them all! Like bitch I would run and hide by myself like fuck the rest"
"3997","Sorry kids, real life is scary sometimes."
"3998","The fact that these drills are even necessary"
"3999","it's just a drill bro"
"4000","Waste of time lol.

I swear if they do this like once a month 

In any other country no one does shooting lockdown drills lol. What a surprise"
"4001","my schools by me tell us to sit in a corner and wait to die basically my schools have no common sense though"
"4002","LMAO All In A Corner 
Snipers Dream"
"4003","That takedown pratice is good, but best if used in teamwork."
"4004","at my school we have to barricade  the door and run out the window and if that doesnt work and the shooter gets in we can throw things"
"4005","only in America"
"4006","LOCKING A DOOR, PUTING UP A SHADE AND HIDING BEHIND YOUR DESK IS NOT GOING TO DO JACK SHIT, YOU NEED TO PILE AS MUCH SHIT AGAINST THAT DOOR AS POSSIBLE (DESKS, CABINETS, ETC) AND AGAINST WINDOWS TOO AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE SPREAD OUT IN ROOM READY TO FIGHT SO IF ANYONE DOES GET IN EVERYONES SPREAD OUT SO ITS HARDER TO SHOOT ALL OF THEM AND EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO THROW AT THE SHOOTER IF HE DOES GET IN SO HES DISORIENTED IF HES AUTOMATICALLY HIT WITH 20 TEXTBOOKS OR BACKPACKS, ETC SO THEN EVERYONE CAN THEN CHARGE THE SHOOTER AT ONCE SO THEY CAN KILL HIM (EYE GOUGING, BITING, ETC), SURE A COUPLE PEOPLE WILL DIE BUT A COUPLE IS BETTER THAN 50 OR 100 OR 30. schools need to rethink because even if a door is locked the shooter will just shoot off door handle so he can get in. Its sad to see these kids under the care of these teachers to then see SOME teachers are making the worst mistakes possible."
"4007","I used to go here"
"4008","When u live in England so u don't suffer as much as America"
"4009","Why don't they do these in the uk?"
"4010","yea my shool had a real shootout it lasted 2 hours"
"4011","100 pound student take out the 200 pound shooter 


really most shooters are student themselves and people who don't take care of themselves and who rely on their gun for terror"
"4012","Fucking hell, america is an awful fucking place"
"4013","Yeah guys lets just put all of the kids in one corner so that they all are vulnerable"
"4014","columbine rip Rachel joy Scott and the other 12 people"
"4015","Me In a drill:
Me: FUCKFUCKFUCK!!!
Shooter: *goes in classroom* 
Me: *hides next to the shooter* FUCK U *slams baseball bat at them* muwehehehe"
"4016","The longest I've been in a school lockdown was about 3 hours long, it was a bomb threat at the apartments across the street and I was in 7th grade (I'm a sophomore now)"
"4017","ass"
"4018","she put his assistant down"
"4019","You would think the shooter is looking at this video right now and rethinking his strategy when he gets in that school. I really  don't like how the media is shouting out their plan to protect themselves."
"4020","Only country this is needed in is the usa ofc lol. Stupid ass country with fucked up people"
"4021","Assuming only men can use and shoot guns"
"4022","Gunman still didnt fight back really. 99% of the time a woman of her size, trying to disarm a guy like him ends up deadly for her, even if shes got that grab on him. not even physics would help a whole lot with that. only way i could imagine is to block his gun arm and kick him in the balls/ push in his eyes, however he wouldnt exactly sit still while she does that. overall for her it would be pretty damn unrealistic to disarm anyone even a foot taller than her"
"4023","We did this drill yesterday"
"4024","I wish we would do shooting drills, all we do is tornado drills in which they keep you analy present yourself for like 20 minutes at the least!"
"4025","6:12 lol"
"4026","Lol in my school lock downs are going in a corner where people like me make fake farts and joke around"
"4027","Can we please have that at felixstowe academy, because our school is so shit and I want to close down forever and me be homeschooled then me to become famous like Jacob sartorius"
"4028","Whyyyy would they have a fake shooter.... Just show them what to actually do"
"4029","These kids dont give a fuck, they just laugh."
"4030","Whoever does schoolshootings will rot in hell!!"
"4031","The officers used real guns wtf"
"4032","I like this"
"4033","I wish this was how the lockdowns were at my school but we just sit like retards and half of us are talking and laughing. I wish that i could put them in the actual situation so they would stop"
"4034","Why cant teachers be trusted to have a concealed weapon? Its not like they are going to be able to do anything without them"
"4035","Seriously? Pretending kids are dead with fake blood that's to far. And the police should stop prepping for shooters but domestics. There are much more of those then shoot ups."
"4036","I had a real shooting lockdown"
"4037","lmao in the UK we only have fire drills"
"4038","having everyone stand up with something to through is actually a bad idea keep in mind with the two shots that would have killed two KIDS most likely"
"4039","Machine guns next to fire extinguishers?"
"4040","Lockdowns? Schools sure don't have that in Denmark"
"4041","In Europe there's no such thing. ;-) Why America allows guns?"
"4042","Or you could stop giving idiots guns??"
"4043","Here's a better idea for a school drill and school protection: give the teachers a firearm and license to carry in schools so they put a couple rounds in that SOB.  This'd end the situation before it escalates into a serious issue."
"4044","Hey the shooter just came through the door lets through plastic balls at him"
"4045","Investing in more police officers with school protection only functions... no, sorry, how can I be such an idiot?! Like if one of the Governments core aim was to protect citizens. Sorry guys."
"4046","Only in America"
"4047","I wish they had this at my school"
"4048","Only in America, it's school not a firing range."
"4049","A man came onto our campus armed with a baseball bat."
"4050","In a drill everything goes as plan in real world everybody takes off outside the window"
"4051","this was actually a good video"
"4052","Tf I would never huddle behind A desk, that's too much of an easy target BITCH I WOULD THROW A CHAIR AT THE WINDOW AND GET MY ASS OUTTA THERE"
"4053","What the fuck is wrong with America just get rid of the guns"
"4054","These drills are fucking stupid... Get every kid to huddle together behind a desk in a large group where there is no escape? They are just asking for collateral damage. They need to get the kids to escape out the window maybe? Or grab scissors or something strong and wait silently at the door until they come in and stab him in the neck. These idiots don't understand the instinct of survival and put the safety of not being sued or getting into trouble instead of the safety of the school"
"4055","Thank god they are teaching them better now"
"4056","What the hell aren't they just killing the kids if they sit in the corner like if the shooter is at a decint distance away you should run or attack if they come in or try to get out a window and if he comes in throw stuff at him he can't shoot directly if trying to dodge something everyone would flinch if something came hurling at you"
"4057","I EAT BABIES FOR FUCKING BREAKFAST!!!!!EEDFRDBGVFB"
"4058","Last year my teacher said that in the case we screw the plan smash the window and jump out lol"
"4059","+Les King (Lesking72) this is exactly what kids are being advised to do in the situation. Throw shit at the shooter"
"4060","In our school Of we know the shooters on the other side the teachers won't even line us up. We straight up sprint out a there and go to the closest park."
"4061","God wt a good way to confine all the kids to a corner, maybe they will get a double kill! could have come up with a much better way in which to protect them. I can tell you now if I where in there shoes i would be the first one to make a run for the windows or to confront the shooter not huddle in a corner waiting to be mowed  down by a machine gun, Isis inst going to spare life's, and i can tell you i actually want to keep mine."
"4062","ok kids, let's go far away from the door, snuggle up together and remember to show ur face....... litterly the stupidest shit eve..... when lockdown happens i wait near the door just in case he comes in that way I cn choke the cunt"
"4063","I live in Ireland and all we hav is fire drills once a year I'm so thankful to live in a place that that's all we need xxx"
"4064","I'm so lucky I live in England 😂😂"
"4065","What kind of sick school would do that ik its for safety but thats terrifying omg"
"4066","Wow, I never have lock down drills like this.......... the most intense ever was the music teacher telling use how we grab a heavy instrument and distract him while she tries to get the weapon... but she said my new favorite qoute ""Money can be earned back, but a life is lost forever"""
"4067","At my school they bang on the door and slam their body against it, yelling. If they get it open they have a stern word with the teacher."
"4068","It's like in Sandy hoax school"
"4069","Brake the window and run, why would you stay with the shooter"
"4070","my teacher said I can always grabs scissors and stab them if they tried to shoot ANYONE and it makes me kinda scared because they might shoot me before dieing and I'm also happy because I'll die a hero"
"4071","in Australia we dont have any lockdowns"
"4072","I feel like practice for school shooter's is a good thing, I've gone through a hand full of them growing up in my days but their has to be a designated location for children to hide, if you huddle them all in one corner it would be easy target God for bid the shooter gets into the room.."
"4073","This is easily the most stupid thing I have seen like huddle in the corner and die also if the kids are not allowed there phone on them how can they phone parents and shit, also how could a 10 pound kid take down a lunatic that could easily shake off kids and with the tennis ball thing they said about throwing desk chairs but they won't have the range :?)"
"4074","""How do you train schools fora  school shooting?""
Try and make sure there are no guns in the first place :/"
"4075","2:42 ... did she try to say safe"
"4076","If there was a shooter in my high school I would leave the school right away run away. Where ever the shot came from I would run the opposite way. There are a lot of doors and windows in my school."
"4077",",one time my school went on lock down and I was in 4th period and the teacher told us it was just a drill but it went on for 2 hours so people involving me started crying and we were in 7th  so my teacher texted my principal principal  and we found out that she only forgot about our class room so we missed math class and lunch"
"4078","Yay let's throw tennis balls that'll stop em."
"4079","""He was doing 100 and 30"" 😂😂"
"4080","I still don't get why Americans want guns. Limit guns, limit deaths. But I guess it's just too late for America there's no way they could just take back every ones guns. I feel bad for you guys."
"4081","These kids are pussys"
"4082","This makes me want to be a teacher tbh, I love kids so much. They are so innocent I don't understand how people can even think about hurting them :/"
"4083","You know the man was not really trying because she was a girl if i wanted he really wanted to kill he would have punched kicked and fought hard."
"4084","HAHA nobody stays that quiet, also once the the lady says its a *drill* everybody starts laughing, they were only that quiet because the news person was there, also ive never seen this kind of drill in colorado, i mean like there has never been training or a fake shooter, we would only go to the corner."
"4085","My choir teacher plan is to go into the changing room and have the girls go into the bathroom while us guys stand at the door with stools to attack the gunman if he tries to come in"
"4086","during a fire drill i started throwing acorns at my friends"
"4087","Shit i'd love to have one of these ""real"" drills in my school, maybe it'll shut up the multiple decibels of talking and joking aroundz"
"4088","wtf"
"4089","Someone once told me ""if there is a gunman busting down your door and sees you and your class, you might as well try to disarm him because you will get shot eitherway, you will die eitherway unless of course you manage to disarm him then your a national hero"""
"4090","Someone once told me ""if there is a gunman busting down your door and sees you and your class, you might as well try to disarm him because you will get shot eitherway, you will die eitherway unless of course you manage to disarm him then your a national hero"""
"4091","They teach the kids the stupidest fucking tactics. NIGGA BREAK THE WINDOW AND JUMP OUT. FUCK ME GOD DAMNIT!!!!!!!"
"4092","Then the mothafucka kick down the door, and shoot shit!!!"
"4093","I would be the kid that when the shooter Walks in I grab his gun and point it back at him"
"4094","Ppl can't freak out about this bc this is fucking life now as bad as it sounds in in middle school now and I've known what I will do since 3rd grade and that's not gonna be sitting and taking a bullet"
"4095","What about in the south we have outdoor not indoor schools"
"4096","why let teachers bring guns when you have tons of students with sharp pencils."
"4097","at our school when there is a lock down drill everyone messes around"
"4098","fuck if theres a shooter you better belive im gone im not sitting in a corner getting shot up im half a mile down the road when I hear ""Internal Threat"""
"4099","I'm confused, wouldn't it be better to have the kids climb out the window and book it?"
"4100","this is why all these ppl be scared cause of this"
"4101","He said a lot about Colorado! I live in Colorado! This is so cool! I gotta show this to meh school XD"
"4102","this should be in middle schools and up"
"4103","130mph is more than just a ticket😂😂"
"4104","Just give the teachers a gun, problem solved."
"4105","wtf was that he was like 5 percent fighting back she would get instantly shut down irl"

"4110","Kilroy was here"
"4111","fucken liberals buy a gun defend yourself #2ndAmendment"
"4112","My school had two lockdowns, luckily, both were only threatening the school, and no harm was done. During the first lockdown, we used our table as shields and hid as best as we could. However, the second lockdown, nobody really cared. Everybody was laughing, and playing around. Nobody took it seriously. If there was a shooter, I'd be dead by now."
"4113","Huddle up in one corner is such a great idea during a school shooting."
"4114","Lol when the guy resisted the disarm, there was no punching involved. In real life the shooter would be punching her so much"
"4115","Most of the shooters a teens anyway 😂"
"4116","At my school during a drill it's just like a normal class but the door is locked"

"4118","why don't all teachers keep a gun in their classroom"
"4119","I'm from Colorado and I've never had a drill with a fake shooter we just sit and do nothing"
"4120","We kinda did this in my old school and it scared the crap out of me. People don't actually come in or lay around in the halls, they just make it sound like they are kicking the door down and yell a bit."
"4121","In my old elementary school we had closets that were basically empty with locks inside, so in a drill we had we were told to go under our desks but 5  smart kids including me went in the closets and and locked ourselves in and after the drill was over we got in trouble for not listening to orders and we started yelling at him how it was safer in there and we got sent to the office for talkback...."
"4122","almost all could work"
"4123","hey, or help change gun laws!"
"4124","Putting the kids in one corner is honestly fucking stupid. A shooter could easily get a nuclear in 15 seconds. Bad jokes aside, I believe it would be better if schools barricaded the doors and evacuated if possible through the window."
"4125","bruh stupid schools making us huddle together to get massacred together"
"4126","I had a lockdown once and my principle never said it was a drill so my teacher ran to the corner of the room and moved a wheel able book case infront of the class and stood by the door with a knife then 2 minutes later are principle came pack on and said ""thank you for your time"" 😂"
"4127","great job people you just gave out answers to killers on how to take them down😡👏"
"4128","All it takes are two kids and teachers. someone comes in and tackle him. fucking simple. ""oh just sit in the corner"" what a great way to die"

"4137","I feel so sorry that these sorts of drills have to be done, I live in New Zealand and we don't have to worry about this sort of thing. it's really sad hearing about these things happening and I wish people didn't do it. I feel so sorry for the people that have to live like this :("
"4138","in my school they do fire, tornado, shootings, and bomb drills. Theyve been doing it for years and we have never had an incidents"
"4139","If I hear gunshots at my school I'm fucking smashing the window and running for my life"
"4140","now see if they did this at my school kids would pull up om the shooter and bust a cap in his ass low key lmfaooo"

"4144","I wonder why they only do this in white peoples schools😂"
"4145","bruh the guy doing the drill is having so much fun"
"4146","We had a real lock down (not a drill) and the teacher told us to attack with her 20 fire extinguishers (it's a science lab so I guess?) or use the chairs to attack him or her)"
"4147","Iam a student and if I could get a shooters gu. I would shoot him in the leg and hold the gun on him"
"4148","in my school...they make annoucements on where the shooter is and we try to escape as fast as possible.."
"4149","Once we had a lockdown because of a suspicious man on campus, and my math teacher stood by the door with the fire extinguisher waiting for someone to come in"
"4150","Why don't the kids gang up on the shooter and dog pile him (Does not include me)"
"4151","This video makes me want to shoot up a school. Jk don't take that serious."
"4152","congrats america"
"4153","Easy run from the white kid"
"4154","Teacher: locks door tells kids to go behind her desk.
Shooter: kicks door open or down and kills everyone because they are in a large group..."
"4155","Yes this is good, but the thing is...they are practicing with a fake gun that CAN'T shoot. In the real deal when the struggle happens the shooter will still be able to shoot wherever direction the teacher and the gunman are fighting. In crossfire the students will be hit."
"4156","what did I just see"
"4157","all these fucking white people need to stop shooting up schools"
"4158","school shootings have gone to far when schools have to do school shooting preparations"
"4159","I'd give every teacher a firearm in their class room, behind glass that needs something hard to break. Give every teacher a basic firearms training class. That would greatly reduce school shootings, or at least the casualties of school shootings."

"4166","+SophiePlaysRoblox yah but last year now they have to stack up desks and stuff and if the shooter breaks in we have to threw stuff at them  at least that's were I live"
"4167","Yeah in elementary school 5 th grade we would all go to a corner and lock all  of the doors sit down and be quiet then the office ladies would come and pull on the doors to see if they were locked... no real training. (live in Colorado) near Ft.Collins."
"4168","also that guy was not trying at all"
"4169","One time there was an actual lock down in our school because someone had a metal air soft gun and cut all the plastic off and threatened people with it. Of course, they specified that it was NOT A DRILL but people in my class were making so much noise, banging against the walls, and I was seriously thinking that we were going to die. Of course, since the gun wasn't real, nobody was shot but the SWAT team was actually brought in because this kid kept threatening people."
"4170","+Misdre Lmao I stumbled across this at school today, what do you know? (Wasn't a gun own bun rather an intruder drill) we had to sit in the corner behind the projectors curtain and all, and well a kid tuned on this song, called funny food names...

AND I'M A STUDENT WTF IS THIS BULLSHIT"
"4212","the huddle up together? what a bunch of morons."

"4219","they kind of do this in my school, but my schools just lock the doors and have us do our work in the dark. And if someone knocks and we're making a sound they literally yell ""Be Quiet"""
"4220","What the fuck is this? Why can't the teacher just carry a gun? That's what they started doing in Israel and the school shootings went down!"
"4221","Why can't they just have the teacher next to the door waiting for the shooter to disarm the bitch, and prepare the kids to run for the exit?"
"4222","It's a sad day when you have to practice this shit"
"4223","At my school my teachers said if they get shot we can go hells loose on the killer"
"4224","In my class last year there was a bomb treat , all my classmates we're too noisy then the bomb blows up .

Everyone was quiet . 

Fuckin Freshman smh"
"4225","my crush name is holly I have'd liked her for 4 years this year I am with her"
"4226","my district just came out with a new policy where instead of just locking the doors, covering the windows, and hoping for the best, they encourage kids to barricade doors, throw things at the shooter, come up with a plan in each separate classroom for that class to attack and unarm the gunman, to run if possible, and to hide if you don't feel comfortable doing anything else"
"4227","+Fridght Street are you retarded? I never saidthat there were NO guns, I said that there are barely any. I said I've never seen them and that most people haven't. Oh and home made bombs? Oh yes, well a gun will obviously let you disarm that bomb... Fool. First, read what I say, then respond with something that resembles the argument I am making."
"4228","2 years ago a kid in my class farting during a lock down drill and my teacher was Pissed"
"4229","You know because its smart to huddle up in the corner of a classroom during a shooting -_-"
"4230","it only drill. why you heff to be scared?"
"4231","In my school 6 years ago to now they warn us in the morning and in the afternoon after lunch we hide and sometimes the janitor comes to check if the door is locked than leaves last less than 3 minutes"
"4232","Guys lets make fire drills more realistic too, someone get me a lighter"
"4233","I wish my school did stuff like this, seems fun"
"4234","At my school we have Locke down drills that are boring and this is more intense cuz they had a guys with a fake gun but we have to just sit in the corner of the class for 8 minuts"
"4235","It's a free country?"
"4236","why don't the just grab there gun when they relold"
"4237","Yeah lets through fucking tennis balls at the fucking gunman, that'll teach him to fuck with us again xD"
"4238","All I can say is thank god I live in the UK. This is so fucked up, if they had gun control or no guns at all this wouldn't happen as much."
"4239","I like the idea of the training for the teachers, but the ones involving kids could definitely be terrifying for younger kids."
"4240","Holly Carpenter!!"
"4241","all my school does is u need to sit along the counter in a line with the lights turned off"
"4242","omg today in school I'm in 3rd grade we had a fire drill practice I want to set a real fire so my best friendeme dies"
"4243","Throwing tennis balls at a shooter? What the fuck is this, Disney Channel?!"
"4244","Hey guys lets huddle together to be easily shot! Honestly if I was in that situation and it was real I'd jump off the window. I wouldn't care how much trouble I get"

"4256","Why not armor the classroom doors and put locks on them?"
"4257","I'm a 10th grader and I have been doing these drill all my life I'm still scared to death doing these drill they are no fun"
"4258","In my class last year if there was lockdown drill kids laugh and talk"
"4259","You know that guns are too big of a problem when the school practice drills about someone killing them"
"4260","guys are y'all that retarded its good that they are teaching defense but when your in a corner then anyone can shoot you but when you run it much harder than at gunpoint get some sence"
"4261","Why cant they teach the kids martial arts and they hide behind the door when the shooter comes in they fuck him up easy lol"
"4262","When was the last school shooting??? I mean one that wasn't staged??No actors involved?"
"4263","We had one of these drills and I live in England. It is because there was three men on the loose with guns in our area and the police couldn't catch them. No one knew that there was going to be anything like this so when saw three men walking past the window during class while our teacher was screaming to turn the tables in their sides and hide behind them in twos, weilding extremely real looking guns, everyone was soooo scared. No one in my class had ever even seen a gun in real life before. I remembered when I was in Year 6 (Fifth Grade) we did self-defense classes so remembering that, when one of the men came through the door  I grabbed his gun hand in my right hand, his head in my left and wrapped my left leg leg around his right, floored him, sat on him and screamed for everyone to jump on him as I stamped on his hand to get him to drop the gun. I had never been so scared in my life (and neither had he I don't think 😂) but I did it for my friends and my teacher. Everyone was punching him and when our headmaster walked in and told us that it was actually our music teacher and it was just a drill everyone was apologising to him and telling him off at the same time. The next assembly we had I was called to the front of the hall because the police wanted to award me a bravery award. They said that even though it was only a drill, I didn't know that and put my life at risk for my friends and teacher. Everyone was so proud of me."
"4264","Great Britain dosent have these drills 😐"
"4265","MURICA"
"4266","USA : EXPOSED!"
"4267","Why does ""school shootings"" only seem to be a problem in america? Something wrong with your culture maybe hmmmmm?"
"4268","How about treating everyone with respect and kindness so they don't become school shooters in the first place? Fucking muricans I swear..."
"4269","We never have shooting drills, propably because school shooting almost never happen Finland😊"
"4270","During a drill some guy started playing misic"
"4271","Wtf 1:51 hurt showed my school lol"
"4272","those 562 dislikes are either school shooters or 80 year olds who want kids to die"
"4273","During my drills they lock the doors and tell us if there was an active shooter to throw pencils , chairs , paper , book bags , books , pens anything you can."
"4274","time for some cod"
"4275","The only drills we have is fire drills :("
"4276","wow what a good solution. everybody group together in the corner so the shooter doesn't even have to aim."
"4277","I pranked my school.

I wanted to bring water guns to spray my teachers but instead brought real ones lmao 😂👌"
"4278","I think the US should have a law like UK. in order to obtain a gun you need a permit and to get a permit you need to go to the local police station and sign up for a permit and this process take several days even weeks as extensive background checks are conducted and one red flag no gun for you also guns in the UK are not allowed outside and must be kept in a government approved gun cabinet this should also be implemented in the UK."
"4279","Children should not get ""used"" to the idea of a school shooter. That is not safe or efficient. If there was an actual school shooter it would be like the boy who cried wolf. No one would actually do anything."
"4280","Lmao at my school we lock and block the door and we hold a bunch of shit shit to thrown at them when they come in the we mob em lmao"
"4281","We don't do drills in my school  because our government aren't fucktards and guns are illegal"
"4282","""Deal with it"" 
*que thug life music*"
"4283","why the hell do they sit in a big group in the corner if someone comes in there only making themselves a bigger target"
"4284","im glad we dont have to deal with this shit in the uk. America really needs some fucking gun control or to illegalise them completely. Then kids wouldnt have to go to  school worried about being shot."
"4285","These spawn campers..."
"4286","Well all different school shooter have a different style of fighting so I really don't think it's a really good idea for the teacher to fight the shooter cause all shooters have a style of fighting"
"4287","shut up that's dangerous people could be harmed"
"4288","when of these kids I want them die..."" is what she's really thinking"
"4289","Joking don that seem like a joke  I have no life"
"4290","You know you really shouldn't have to prepare teaches for this. It's disgusting how high of a risk this is for America. Especially since it's a place people should be safe from danger. Thank god I'm Australian!!"
"4291","THATS IT!!! Im tired of reading through this comment section and making replies about all the stupid shit about american schools and how they ""plan to protect us"" from psychopaths walking into schools and murdering. I am going to put EVERYTHING in this comment, it will be a huge one but it will be very effective lmao. So first of all i will be addressing everything as it is in America, not ireland or the uk JUST America. In america complete strangers are just allowed to walk into our schools with no ID, now of course a security member from the schools staff will come and escort him out of the school and tell him he needs a valid reason to be here but they dont do anything about it. They just let anyone walk in and dont give a fuck. Now the next issue is how school security works. In the school i was in they had a ""security team"" which was just like 2 guys in there forties who told kids to not put there gum underneath tables, they are completely unarmed and have no means of defending a student or even defending them selves against some sort of attack. The walls are only brick in Some school buildings, the rest of the school is like a card board box. I could make a school look like swiss cheese if i wanted to and i wouldnt even have to go INSIDE the school to kill people inside class rooms. The doors are made out of sanded down wood and have only a key locking meckanism. which can easily be lock picked or simply hit with something heavy and instantly put out of action for anyone to walk inside, not to mention they dont even need to open the door they can just shoot everyone in the classroom through the walls and door it self. Now i can do my next step, School Lockdown drills. Boy is this one going to be long. So first of all the way school lock downs work is just retarded. Its like they want us to die or something. If some one with a gun walks on school campus then the class rooms are told to go on lock down, Instead of getting the students to safety they just have them all bunch up together so that the shooter doesnt have to spend so many rounds wasted on thick human flesh. Congratulations american schools, Now you can save the shooter ammunition costs. Then schools have this idea, that turning off the lights in a class room will just magically protect them or some bullshit. Im pretty sure everyone not living under a rock knows that OBVIOUSLY if a room light is turned off then that means there are kids hiding in there. people dont just turn off lights in school Mid-Day, they are on 24/7. Its like puting a sticky note on the door that says, ""Hey you school shooter! Guess what? theres a whole class of 30 kids in here waiting for bullets to come ring them like a pepper shaker.
                                                      
Well thats about it for today folks, remember to Panzer Vor!"
"4292","our school would have the teachers close the doors and turn off the lights. ""in case the monsters from the dark tried to grab the children"" then we'd all sit there for the shooter to come and pick us all off using as little ammunition as possible, no skills needed."
"4293","In the UK, We have ""intruder alarms"". 
Scares the shit outta me, because we don't even have guns. lol"
"4294","solution: get rid of guns"
"4295","Kentucky encourages us students at college to swarm the shooter and throw anything at them to get them out of the room and big guys get training in special tactics to take down and dis arm a shooter,,,  also could be special tactics for a future school shooter to to learn what they're up against and how to take out good guys"
"4296","Everyone keeps saying that America should ban guns, I do not believe that America could survive a second civil war. We lost nearly 3 percent of our population in the first one. Today that equivalent would be almost 6.2 million people. Not worth it."

"4305","I would be that one kid while the shooter walks by thinking the class is empty I would fart and he would come back"
"4306","It's STUPID to be in one group for the kids like a huddle because if someone does come into the room the kids are right there. Spread out the kids and make them sit on one knee and have something hard in their hand and be ready to go and if they have to hit the shooter."
"4307","I have 1 lock down drill like per 5000000 years"
"4308","there's no shooting drills in my school, I guess it's for america"
"4309","School shooters went to school aswell they aren't fucking retards they know if the lights off there's most likley kids and there most likley hiding in a corner"
"4310","no one's messing with my freinds and my teacher if there's a shooting I will fucking throw a fucking chair at his ass"
"4311","I don't think this is a good idea because if they keep having drills at that one school, people will stop taking them seriously. Like, what if a real emergency happens and everyone thinks ""Oh, it's just a drill. We're fine."" Idk."

"4340","+Explosions Your name goes perfectly with this comment."
"4341","MY SCHOOL HAD LIKE 6 IN A MONTH SHITS FUCKED MAN"
"4342","it's just a prank bro"
"4343","Me too. I hate how stupid some kids can be.. they even laughed when they're wasn't a drill and there was an active shooting in the apartments across from my school."
"4344","if you look at the kids your SUPPOSED to be quiet even when its a drill because what if it wasnt and the kids were doing nOTHING to keep quiet? THAT would be the first room to get shot at."
"4345","In my school too"
"4346","it's a drill"
"4347","+JAS ProductionSs that's not a drill and yea we have a similar thing called a code yellow or ""soft lock down"" where we can't leave our class for anything and onetime we were in our class for 3 hours and had to get hot lunch delivered to the room"
"4348","And no I don't think this would work because the person or people that are attacking the shooter can all of a sudden become paralyzed in fear"
"4349","this is right the kids should fight. Cause the shooter will probably know there  still in the class there probably just sitting in balls and being quite. idk?"
"4350","if  this happens in my school in standing by the door with a chair.... when he opens it BAM"
"4351","Bruh mine Is like three hours"
"4352","This is what a shooting drill should be. People need to take these situations seriously. In my school, all we do is ""keep quiet"" and huddle in a corner. Students are laughing while there could potentially be a shooter on campus. Maybe having a more realistic drill will make students more aware of what could happen."
"4353","at my school all you do in a lockdown drill is go the the corner of the classroom and stay quiet"
"4354","oh this is simple to solve america ban guns you gun crazy bastards put them down"
"4355","I mean tho"
"4356","On the grass thi"
"4357","In my old school it was a fire drill and police and firefighters came lol I thought it was real but it wasn't and we had to wait outside"
"4358","Y'know what fucking stupid? How school doors work, they make them push inside, my school had a shooting two years ago and a shooter didn't getting anyone but he was kicking in doors by the dozen, my school took action and switched it up, now we have metal core doors that look like wood and line up with the wall witch has two metal wires (the really thick ones) that hook to the wall, they been kicked down before but with around twenty forceful kicks, classrooms have been provided with rope ladder and trap doors that lead to the school basement that commoners won't know about, as much as I hate setting up a school and getting it ready for a shooter by redesigning it so it's more like a bunker than a school but it's better safe than sorry,"
"4359","Hide under the desk? Bitch no, I'm jumping out the window and hauling ass into the woods. I'd rather sprain an ankle and scratched up by branches than shot. Survival of the smartest."
"4360","Basically, if you tried to do one of those arm takedowns on a real school shooter, chances are he'd shoot you if he saw you. It's more than likely (like dylan and eric, the columbine killers) that the shooter will have more than one gun. For instance dylan klebold, had a sawed- off double barrel shotgun, and a tec DC 9 machine pistol. If you took down one arm, he'd shoot you with the other. same with eric. but his guns were both two handed. 995 hi point carbine and a sawed off pump action shotgun."
"4361","I have to wear Uniform In School that school is lucky"
"4362","Since guns will never be completely gone, we need to teach people how to handle a school shooter in ways that maybe they can save everyone from being killed."
"4363","One time I hit a intruder with desk xD"
"4364","it's stupid that they have them all in one corner if I walked in on that (if I was a shooter) that would be the jack pot"
"4365","Lmao, America is so fucked. God help you people."
"4366","What they really should do, Is 1) Put large and heavy shelves in front of the door, 2) place anything & everything in front of the door so the ""shooter"" cant get in. 3) Have a few bats under the teachers desk just in case. 4) have an emergency escape area in every classroom so the teachers & students can escape safely and call the police."
"4367","Notice the kids who fight a lot are aether the shooter or the most scared one science"
"4368","Ahhhh gun free zones. The death zones... nobodies there to EASILY stop them. CC can save so many lives during a shooting. They just don't wanna wake up and realize a  gun can't do a thing on it's own, it requires a person behind it. My brothers gun hasn't stood up loaded itself and shot someone. Every time I come home it's right were he left it."
"4369","Ok I'm not from the US so this is an honest question. Why aren't the exterior doors of the school locked? Our school in Canada has all exterior doors locked when the children are in class. The front door is always locked, and requires the receptionist to buzz you in after being verified. (300 kids in the school)."
"4370","This is awesome"
"4371","How put a gun in a glass cage in each classroom?"
"4372","Nobody can even get that close to a guy with a gun!"
"4373","White people 101"
"4374","Quietly? Oh, not at my school. Everyone talks."
"4375","Why do ones that are un-announced and that are not know as a drill? That would make a ""Boy who cried wolf"" Story sooner or later, especially in high-school. Kids will think ""Oh just another ""drill"" this shit aint serious just fuck around"" when there's actually a shooter on campus"
"4376","Good it teaches kids how to be prepared"
"4377","They are loving it, until it actually happens."
"4378","Once we had a lockdown drill so we all went behind my teachers desk. So we just sat there out of sight and my teacher moved her chair in front of us. She said that she was going to protect us if there was willing to protect us no matter what. She is my favorite teacher for many reasons."
"4379","One day it might be a real shooter and the kids will think it was just a drill"
"4380","dad was going 130 hahahahaha, dude was loving life"
"4381","take the shooters gun and say don't move or I'll shoot me I would shoot if was me"
"4382","Thats why me and friends learn Krav Maga"
"4383","Maybe dint give ten year olds cellphones and there wouldnt be a problem"
"4384","People at my school need to shut up during lockdowns I get so fucking paranoid that they're going to be laughing if there was ever a real shooter"
"4385","Apparently they are going to start lock downs like these on the UK which ia rather scary as I am currently in a High School in the UK"
"4386","3:49 RIP the shooter"
"4387","We live in a VERY safe town, but all my middle school teachers are armed with airlift guns or pellet guns. Lol"
"4388","...
For real? It's easy tell students that tomorrow there will be a lock down drill. Then people come in with guns and try to break in. 

But parents have the right to know whatever the children are doing. In fact parents should be allowed to sit in the classroom if they want as long as they do disrupt."
"4389","our teachers tell us not to text out parents so they don't come to the school like the dad did. they say it gets in the way if the police."
"4390","my teacher knows martial arts!!"
"4391","i kinda wanna do this!"
"4392","My teachers say if this happens for real and the person comes in they will try and protect us then us kids can throw desks chairs and books and even scissors at then"
"4393","this is literally asking for a school shooting it's like they want one to happen god what kind of world is this coming to"
"4394","If someone with a gun come in our school we ask them if they can sit down and watch the leafs game eh!"
"4395","Shooting drills: sit in a corner. Acual shooting: 5 kids merking the intruder, 1 crying in the corner, 3 eating lunch, 10 sitting in the corner, 1 jumps out the window, 1 doing homework, and 1 sleeping."
"4396","okay who hear is practicing 2 shoot up a school here? be honest"
"4397","what the hell was tht at 3:59"
"4398","man i wish this would happen at my school it would be kinda funny"
"4399","this is purely amazing. This school isn't just doing a regular lockdown drill where they all talk and laugh and sit under a desk. they're taking action and preparing the students and teachers the best they can if anything like this happened. and it could happen and if it does this school will more likely fight against the shooter and win.I love this this is the best thing you can do for this school"
"4400","It's just a drill, bro"
"4401","You go Jodie!💯👌"
"4402","I would rather have drills and know what to do then have an actual shooting and have no idea what to do. Lucky I live in England so the only drill we have to do is the fire alarm"
"4403","wtf huddling in a corner only makes them a bigger target and so much more easier to kill"
"4404","Why is America so screwed up?"
"4405","When I go to school I always pick a seat next to the closet just in case"
"4406","that last drill should be taught to schools all around the world, it looks extremely effective and could probably save a lot of lives"
"4407","I don't watch tv so i just watch thus"
"4408","I live in highlands ranch. MY school doesn't do this drill to this extent."
"4409","Why just sit down in a corner i would've just jumped out the window and sayed ""SAYANORA BISHES!"" Jk"
"4410","one time i had a 30 min lock down drill"
"4411","How is backing into a corner in plain sight going to stop a shooter from killing them?"
"4412","3:49 a wwe chair could be more effective"
"4413","The only way to stop the shooter is...








Bring a gun with ya to school everyday"
"4414","This would be just as traumatic for kids as if this was real. I understand it, but they should be practising with knowledge of it. So they dont have ptsd over this, because it could happen."
"4415","The fbi should investigate the people who disliked this video 😂"
"4416","this is actually so sad, I didn't know it was this bad, one a month? I live in England , we don't have these so I didn't know why they had them in America. this is so depressing, why would anyone shoot up a school?"
"4417","Omq at my school THE FIRE DRILL AND LOCK DOWN DRILL SOUNDS THE SAME! In the lock downs go to the nearst class room then hide while a fucking annoying as shit alarm playsFor A WHOLE TEN MINS!"
"4418","An armed teacher solve a lot of problems.  Gun Free Zones are easy targets for criminals"
"4419","People at my school be talking and laughing during our drills😒"
"4420","Why did they throw tennis balls? Of all things tennis balls!"
"4421","remember the only drill we would worry about is a fire drill"
"4422","I have an answer to school shootings. Teacher ccw."
"4423","I kinda agree with school shooters"
"4424","Or you can have the skinniest guy in class stand next to where the door opens with a trash can in his hands and put it over the guy and have everyone attack."
"4425","fuck that im throwing a desk"
"4426","Yeah hiding behind a desk is goin to stop a .223 yeah ok real smart. No we need armed persons in schools bc the only was to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun"
"4427","Yeah hiding behind a desk is goin to stop a .223 yeah ok 😂 real smart. No we need armed persons in schools bc the only was to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun"
"4428","I live in Colorado & my school doesn't do this"
"4429","Americans are so stupid."
"4430","Whenever my class does a drill, some kids just start laughing and making noises. I swear they're gonna get us fucking killed one day."
"4431","We dont do drills because i live in a country that is full of retards"
"4432","Poor American children, having to worry about being shot while at school... Glad I live in the UK"
"4433","My friends parents told her to get as many people out of the classroom and out that window and if the teacher trys to stop her put the teacher unconscious and get them out."
"4434","We did this drill at our school and we made our teacher cry"
"4435","5:55 What to do if shooter uses another hand to punch or smth?"
"4436","We're told to sit under our desks..."
"4437","You know I live in Ireland and we don't have to be terrified of our school getting shot up at any moment so we don't have these here, wanna know why? Because we actually have gun control and laws that prevent phycos like school shooters actually getting their hands on guns"
"4438","There was rumors of Isis attacking the place where I live so our school had a practice lockdown drill. What did we do? Use it for an excuse to halt working of course."
"4439","I was in a REAL lockdown situation and the principal came and wiggled on my door making sure it was locked, everyone else new it was the principal except for me. I thought it was a shooter or an unwanted presence trying to get into our class. I'm still scared to this day. it sucks"
"4440","I never understood having all kids cower in a corner. Like God forbid if a shooter barged into the room everyone in the corner would be dead. Contrary to what would've happened if the kids were spread out and communicated to take down the shooter."
"4441","Probably should have sent a letter home a couple days before the drill letting parents know it was only a drill.  I would not have told the kids it was a drill though and would have kept everything else the same.  In a real life shooting, they will have weapons and there will be no warning"
"4442","they don't even lock the door"
"4443","This is why teachers should be able to carry and hide firearms throughout the classroom."
"4444","My school doesn't have these types of drills but if it did I'd be terrified"
"4445","Drills like this would never happen if America were smart enough to handle guns properly"
"4446","One time there was a bomb threat at the highschool while I was in elementary and we had to evacuate and if any thing were to happen we would have to run into the woods"
"4447","Damn she's strong"
"4448","Airsoft"
"4449","If everyone hid behind the door then when he comes in jump on him"
"4450","The door is suposed to be locked and they sit in a corner so if someones looks in the window on the door or window in the classroom they cant be seen."
"4451","Or just break the window and run..."
"4452","+Nick B nice 1"
"4453","+Aislinn Vasquez 
You also do not seem to have understood the sarcasm."
"4454","+Jett Abouhamad 
My friend, you do not seem to have understood the sarcasm ;)"
"4455","+hatching draggon you are brain numbingly stupid. Yes, guns don't kill people but if guns are easier to access,people are more fucking likely to shoot people. Stop being so ignorant u dumb cunt"
"4456","same"
"4457","same"
"4458","same"
"4459","+Slay V the problem is, you're most likely to die with them 😓"
"4460","+valentin ion or a boy throws a dido,  and everyone stops even the shooter and look at him... ""what?... I've bought it for safety reasons. LOL"
"4461","+Speedshot05 - Central a wwe chair"
"4462","It would be like a chair or a stapler or something heavy"
"4463","oh. I guess I understand why nvm."
"4464","Stay safe boo"
"4465","+John Smith Mine don't either but honestly you're not helping"
"4466","+Socrates Jones I am simply grateful my days at school didn't consist of mad gunman shooting drills. That's all."
"4467","Can you shut the fuck up? It's not like you even care about the children getting shot anyway, stop being a cocky prick and stop pretending like you do."
"4468","+Andrew Hillenbrand thats not very good"
"4469","Lol yea the criminals will hand over there guns. Columbine they had fucking bombs. Paris was done with a truck. Should we ban trucks smart ass?"
"4470","Yay Ireland 😂"
"4471","Little gun control, and America is 111th in per capita murders."
"4472","Lol, because it's a drill, do you want him breaking school property for a drill."
"4473","in a lockdown the corner is the best place to hide but the intruder could shoot through the door..oh shit"
"4474","+MrProductionK Wtf are they in the same corners"
"4475","to lure the intruder in so the classmates can get him"
"4476","BRUH everyone is laughing during those I'm just like...are u trying to kill yourself? 😂"
"4477","Ima beat they ass if they break into my room."
"4478","those selfe defense ant gonna work"
"4479","kids should be scared they should not be used to it"
"4480","If came to school high and forgot about the lockdown drill I would hop out of the window so fast fuck all the bullshit I'll take my chances running!"
"4481","In my school we're only huddled in a corner in the dark with a loud ass siren going on in the PDA"
"4482","my high school lock down drill is if the shooter is far... than evac out of the school if he's close than hide"
"4483","This kinda happened at my school.Officers came into our school,dressed like killers.We had been told about every previous drill,but not this one.We were in the hallway,so we had to hide in the sauce cellar in our school cafeteria!I had to calm my best friend down.Everyone was so scared!!😱"
"4484","What about Anti Bullying Programs. The ones that are committing these shooting and killing sprees are victims of bullying who wants revenge from their tormentors."
"4485","I was in one for 1 hour and it was real😂😂😂"
"4486","This is why we need our students to carry guns. Trump 16!"
"4487","umm That's A Bad Way To Do A Drill"
"4488","Only in America"
"4489","Last year I had a teacher who said if there was ever a real lock down, he would give out as many scissors as he can to us, and if the shooter came in we can tackle them.
He was always protective of his students"
"4490","""its not about the flashbacks of the combine..."" HALF LIFE 3 COMFIRMED!!!! 3:34"
"4491","I think its crazy how we never need to have a shooting drill"
"4492","Americans and guns, Damn."
"4493","shit 5 minutes she is lucky I had to stay at school for 3 or 4 hours"
"4494","How about U all stand against a wall and make it easier for the shooter"
"4495","Why does the USA insist on keeping their guns???!!! I can tell you school shootings never happen in England! We only have fire drills!"
"4496","In Ireland we don't even have drills,mainly because school shootings don't happen here"
"4497","I was in a ""shooting drill"" once and I accidentally K.O. the supposed shooter with a chair"
"4498","The longest I've had is 25 min"
"4499","we don't get drills in England so I never had to go through this since i was 9 As i use to live in USA and we did drills and I was tromitzed"
"4500","""When you look at those kids are you always thinking somebody could **snap** take away their lives like that?
What the fuck. Who goes around looking at kids thinking they could get killed any moment."
"4501","Y'all should of kept it a secret now the shooters are gonna come back with like boozokas XD"
"4502","When I had a real drill of ppl breaking in the white knifes I was crying at first but then I was happy that I didn't have to do work XD"
"4503","We don't go that far at my school. Our gym teacher just comes through and bangs on our doors and if he hears any noise we fail the test."
"4504","if someone points a handgun at you. quickly pull the lever thing the wrong way to take it apart 😇"
"4505","id fake dead i would hold my breath as long as i could"
"4506","Yeah very smart to make people actually think that there's going to be a school shooting.."
"4507","Am I the only one who thinks this is crazy? In my school we just hide under the desks"
"4508","Yeah lets see how much of this the elementary school kids remember if shots get fired."
"4509","Shit defense"
"4510","This is stupid, you will never get close enough to someone with a glock to grab them. There is a better chance of surviving the drop out your 3rd story window. You'll just end up like the British after the Battle of the Somme."
"4511","what the hell, thats so fucked up dude, going into a room and shooting a cap gun around, and putting fake blood on kids"
"4512","Knowing that this school trains their teachers doesn't make me feel good about going back to my school."
"4513","HOO The hell wata rob a school!!?!??!"
"4514","Can I get likes for no reason?"
"4515","Just a prank bro"
"4516","This is such a good idea! At my school, we only do fire drills... At my old school which happens to be in Colorado, our janitor was murdered on campus"
"4517","we bring AK-47 at my school"
"4518","Teacher:  ""Huddle under a desk""

Student 1: ""but what if they break the door/window and start spraying bullets""

Teacher: ""it's ok if we don't look at them they can't see us"""
"4519","They just need to tell parents and tell them not to tell the kids"
"4520","This would be great time to grab the person you hate and use them as a body shield"
"4521","Don't you hate those kids that always motion to each other or whisper and giggle during the drills."
"4522","In my middle school, 2 years ago, there was a bomb threat and we all had to evacuate (it was fake tho but not a drill)
So now whenever we see something suspicious (like a piece of paper saying something like 'I'm gonna burn the school down' or 'I'm gonna rape her next period') we usually have detectives come around our school looking around for clues. Also we had 3 police officers and a K-9 unit show up because a girl 4 lockers away from mine brought weed to school and smoked it in the bathrooms. (We only knew this because she bragged about it to her friends who then told a teacher)
Anyways just felt like sharing about how my school keeps us safe. :)"
"4523","Throws a bomb boom every one dies"
"4524","God damnit even in a shooting we got campers more campers then COD :("
"4525","That takedown tho"
"4526","This Can't happen in Canada Right?"
"4527","Guns are illegal in Ireland so we don't have drills like this."
"4528","oh let's hide under a desk like they won't see us here lol what stupidity"
"4529","oh let's hide under a desk like they won't see us here lol what ducking dumbasses"
"4530","oh let's hide under a desk like they won't see us here lol what ducking dumbasses"
"4531","Every school I've been to, had kids constantly joking around and yelling ""WHITE kid shooter!!!"""
"4532","My school has had 6 people (different times) threaten to kill everyone no one was ever shot now we have cops every where at our school and there is only like 400 kids in the school and the town it is in only has 500 people pretty bad"
"4533","oh my god."
"4534","At 4:29 that asian guy is really hot"
"4535","How about in each classroom you have a handgun locked in an unbreakable cabinet that the students have no idea exist, and sets off an alarm if you try and open it when it's locked. So when the school is in a state of emergency where a school shooter is on the scene, the police can see this on CCTV with panic button alarms going off, press in a secret code on a screen in their office and all the handgun cabinets are unlocked for the teachers to take one each to defend their classrooms with. 

And the teachers are trained to use a handgun before hand and go through rigorous mental health and criminal record checks."
"4536","I wish this happened in England"
"4537","""Alright kids, lets huddle up in a corner where it will be 10x easier for the gunner to kill us!"
"4538","my 2 son's well be prepard thanky you"
"4539","if this happend at my school we would all be waiting behind the door and when the shooter walks in its all fun and games 😀"
"4540","at my school if it's real were allowed to fight with anything we have"
"4541","Ban all assault school shooting drill"
"4542","We had a shooting drill and my classmate Ginger went to the bathroom and she screamed so loud we heard it and she came to run in the classroom we didn't know who it was she said IT'S ME GINGER and he started shooting"

"4544","3:01 she can set some traps up and camp with her shotgun"
"4545","i wish my school had drills like that lmao"
"4546","This drill may work for someone armed with a pistol but what if that fuckers armed with a rifle? It'll be harder to disarm."
"4547","Any fucker comes into my school with a gun I'll throw my bag at him. I'm pretty sure it'll crack his thick ass skull. If he ain't dead, imma take his gun and empty the mag into that fuckers brain or balls"
"4548","problem with the one is they forget the step of locking the door"
"4549","America has SERIOUSLY got some fucked up kids. Obviously doing something wrong."
"4550","130 my ass!"
"4551","need to just stick armed guards in the schools and no one will fuck with the schools and if they did I think we would all know what wood happen"

"4559","there us like 50 kids  vs 1 wtf put them  in a attack stance"
"4560","FIX GUNLAWS FIRST!!!!"
"4561","I was scarred for my life when we had a lockdown and a police officer bassically pretended to be a killer and he says ""I know your in there just come to the door and open it""I was actually thinking I was gonna die in a gym in a girls locker room and I was scared to death my gym teacher told me she wouldn't let me die but I shit you not I was in the counselor office for 2 hours and I was very scared I am very scarred I think they could at least just say this is not a drill duck down and cover instead of scaring the shit out of us"
"4562","What happens if a student slams a desk on him and he dies"
"4563","The classes should always have a dipper full of shit so a teacher can hide behind the door then when the shootr comes the kids throw hard stuff then the teacher smack the dipper full of shit on the shooter's  face. utimate defend"
"4564","It is actually safer to block the door with the students chairs and desks, so if the lock somehow breaks, the teacher and students have time to arm themselves"
"4565","What happens when there is an actual lockdown and the kids are just chatting under the desk 😑"
"4566","It stupid how the teachers take the shooter, the shooter could easily put them in a head lock."
"4567","The words ""school"" and ""shooting"" should never be in the same sentence. Welcome to the new America. 😔"
"4568","Thank god i live in a safe country."
"4569","y the us gotta be so fucked up..."
"4570","""Mission failed we'll get em next time"""
"4571","In my school we would have the teacher distract them while all the kids are armed and ready to attack. But we were told don't do it to be a hero or the cool kid. Do it to save your life."
"4572","At my school there was an alert teachers did not know what that means because in my country that nver happens. The alert was a malefunction"
"4573","We line up on the wall of our door. No one can shoot us or unlock the door cause we have a wire in the glass we also lock the door plus they keep their cell phones on the desk"
"4574","How stupid. If some armed person comes into the school your just going to sit in a corner. I'm just gonna flip of the teachers and go run out the door"
"4575","why not arm the teachers with guns? of course once they obtain proper training."
"4576","+Lisha A. These shooters must have dozens and dozens of bad experiences during their childhood years. They must have been bullied severely. As they grow older. The childhood experience backs fire towards them."
"4577","+Ragu Spaghetti Sauce Yes, there may be some people who want revenge, but what about the psychopaths? The shooter at Sandy Hook didn't kill a bunch of children for revenge, he shot for another reason."
"4578","You want more Bullies ? Then there's more School shootings."
"4579","lol ""anti-bullying programs"" when do those ever work?"
"4580","Kids shouldn't be the ones with the guns, they're too unstable. There definitely should be guns in teachers' and security's hands though."

"4591","+strawbana umm yeah I don't agree with them doing this to elementary schools aka 1st to 4th grade from where I'm from but by 5th grade you should be able to handle yourself and I believe these type of drills are perfect for grades 5th threw your work place people think shootings are only at schools no it happens at airports workplaces etc"

"4595","if smearing red paint over some 2nd hand shirt and laying down helps improve my drama mark then I'm up for it"
"4596","Hoo wata shoot in people for fun? lol"
"4597","They don't want to rob the school, they want to kill people. That's what makes it so terrifying. Often the shooters have mental issues that haven't been addressed properly by the state, and yet they manage to procure a gun."
"4598","+Bonnie the Girl bunny the shooter might be mental or having a breakdown"
"4599","+i drink to forget but I always remember ""don't forget the tennis balls"" 😂"
"4600","+i drink to forget but I always remember wow the shooter WITH A GUN will never break the tape!! It's not like they can shoot the door or anything..."
"4601","they bring in drug dogs to my school about 4 times a year because everyone brings freakin pot to school. I go to a school in a relatively wealthy white town where nearly every kid has money to buy drugs. We've had 10 heroine overdoses in the past 4-5 years as well. Stupid people"
"4602","Is that school in colorado?"
"4603","Good to hear that you and your classmates and teachers are ready to do whatever it takes to be safe. Some people have to be idiots with drugs."
"4604","same in the uk"
"4605","Yay Ireland 😂"
"4606","they are illegal in my country too and there has never been a school shooting that i know of"
"4607","That's idiotic.  Guns being illegal will no put an end to school shootings."
"4608","+Dylan you from Ireland ??"

"4610","No turning schools into a police state is the last thing you want to do. Thats so retarded im sorry"
"4611","Why not a gunlocker in a classroom? Or a less life threatening option: tasers"
"4612","+Dat Boii lol"
"4613","Uhh, job well done? The child wouldn't go to the police since it's self defence, like stabbing a thief"

"4619","or the students......"
"4620","Exactly!"
"4621","At my school they just bang on the door"
"4622","wtf the gunman comes in they bring him down but don't grab his gun and but a shot in his head"
"4623","We don't have drills because guns are illegal🙃"
"4624","My school literally has bomb drills and shooter drills and all they are, are kids hiding in the corner of a room. The rooms in my school are all mostly connected and have windows 360 degrees like in the drill we literally saw the ""shooter"" look through the glass in another room across the building and he could c us fine. It was so stupid."
"4625","Heres a tip. If there is a shooting. Don't tell your parents over phones thru text or calls because the first thing they will do is go to the school to get you and that puts them in danger."
"4626","I'll just play dead"
"4627","It my school we have a button you push and the office people pick up and you have to say you frist and last name and if they don't know you they don't let you in but I only have to say my frist name cuz my grandma works in the office and I'm the only Sophia at my school and if they don't have a button they are locked"

"4632","Dude my teacher takes these very seriously cause her high school where she was teaching had an actual shooter for 2hrs and my friend when she was in kindergarten and she came out of the bathroom and at that moment her school had an actual gunman so the guy was down the hall and a teacher saw her but the teacher also saw the gunman so she FUCKIN CLOSED THE DOOR AND THE GUNMAN SAW AND SHOT MY FRIEND KIM.
 and the police arrived and she has a scar and last thing she told me she saw was black"
"4633","Who else wishes that there was no bad people in the world and there was no fire, lightning shooting, and no tornados? I really do.😞🙁👎"
"4634","0:23 I pretty sure how the criminal got in because ethier the teachers forgot to lock the door or the door had no lock on it."

That's just my school."

"4643","ive been in a lockdown 6 times"
"4644","This makes the shooter advised on what to look out for who would post this? This gives more of a chance for people to DIE........"
"4645","i want this to happen in my school so some people would shut up"
"4646","If it was a real school shooting and they tackled him they wouldnt do shit, he's acting so the women can feel good about knocking down a fully grown man."
"4647","This wouldn't happen if people didn't care about their ""hairline""..."
"4648","You actually prepare for shooters in the US? All my school prepare us for is Ofsted Inspections!"
"4649","My school had three lockdowns this year and we just keep teaching just with the doors locked and the lights off. The catch is that the classroom where the lockdown always happened during didn't even have locks which sucked. They ended up being empty threats but I didn't feel safe at all."
"4650","we were discussing this in band and I asked if  we threw something sharp like scissors and them and it stabbed them  she promised that we wouldn't get in trouble"
"4651","this happend to me but it was not police it was a fake terrorist, i texted my dad about it and he Came with an ar 15 to the school and he went in and he almost shot the fake terrorist"

"4657","the tennis all trick might work."
"4658","Wtf what school has a drill like that I have drills at my school but definitely not like that"
"4659","Rest in peace Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold"
"4660","Yeah lets keep the kids inside with a shooter. Yeah going out that window over there and getting help is a horrible idea. We'll get all the help we need staying right here."
"4661","if the ""young ones"" know how to fight and attack and like defend them self why don't they just beat the shooter up like its a bunch of kids and a teach vs like A shooter"
"4662","Drills cannot be announced earlier.. Wtf is wrong with you?"
"4663","none of this dumb shit is going to do anything"
"4664","What about when you're the tallest ?!"
"4665","my school, does the drill but instead of sitting on the ground, we actually are squatting an a teacher has a stick or something to wack the person with an when they do that we can run out an get to safety 👌"
"4666","when the man was fighting back abit, he had an arm free and was in a good position to hit her as her head was open and she had no arms free to protect herself, if he was really fighting back then she would be knocked out in seconds."
"4667","Maybe if the teachers had a gun they could cap a mother fucker who would try this shit."
"4668","At 4:00, this is how lockdowns should be done. I swear, o hate our lockdowns. ""Everyone, sit in a large group in the corner and hide."" I always wonder- the government owns the schools- and if you get them young enough, you have them forever. If you brainwash generations of people that the first thing they should do when faced with gunmen is to lock the door and sit under a table, then there is no one that will fight back. Anyways, good in this school for at least teaching SOME people to not just sit and get shot."
"4669","at my school, only students can enter through the gate (which is locked after 9am) then anyone else who wants to enter has to go in through the office. But there's this thing where the woman in the office has to press this green button to let anyone in so it's really safe!"
"4670","I remember my friend and I were late for school and walked in while there was lockdown. So we, being trench coat wearing badass'es, we look for our class mates. We look in the library, and we find our peers, hiding under the tables, so us believing in natural selection, we kill most of them"
"4671","the thing about these drills are that the shooter most likely knows the drill to so he knows that the lights are turned off and the kids are hiding in the classroom so i thing the cops need to be armed with rifles instead of pistols."
"4672","I remember when there was a real lock down in my school.  At first we thought they had forgotten to say it was a drill, but we were locked in a classroom for more than 10 minutes.  People started crying and there were police roaming around the school and that's when the lock down was over."

"4675","My old 7th grade civics teacher is a retired marine and he got special permission from the school to have a weapon in his classroom incase someone tries to come in"
"4676","Only in America they have shooting drills..."
"4677","Fuck that I am running"
"4678","Kids now think it's just a drill when it could be a real thing"
"4679","so the teachers didnt lock the doors..

That's Florida policy, yeah?"
"4680","Mostly this is how it goes , class go into the corner of the room , we all sit in the corner ( people can still see us in the Windows and can break open the door ) what's the point !"
"4681","BTW bunching kids up take less bullets to kill the mean more deaths"
"4682","And this is why you don't live in America"
"4683","by 7th grade no one gives a fuck"
"4684","At my school we just be quiet and sit down we don't have a person acting like a shooter"
"4685","I wish out school did this! No one takes the drills seriously at my school."
"4686","I wish we had drills like this at my school so we can be prepared🙁😒😢"
"4687","There was once a man with a gun walking around the outside of our school and we had helo"
"4688","You either know it or you dont, if you kinda know it your going to get your self killed"
"4689","when i was little my teacher just sat at the window on her phone while there was a lockdown. i was so little i was shaking and crying. i really didn't like that teacher.."
"4690","Why do those kids pop the fake shooter with tennis balls"
"4691","everytime theres a drill in my class everyone starts screaming as if they saw someone get murdered in front of their eyes"
"4692","The poor students"
"4693","I would total do something as s stugent"
"4694","Wow 130mph way to fast"
"4695","this is why school is dangerous mom!!!"
"4696","Listen man if I'm ever in school and there's a shooting you best believe I'm about to barricade the door like wtf hide under a desk he can easily shot the door and get in..... why not teach student how to block door with desk so he can't get in... Plus you really used a dam peace a paper to hide the window smh"
"4697","Whenever I've had a drill or lock down I've always somehow been in the band hall even if I don't havr band during that period."
"4698","This happened to me just a drill and then an actual shooter came no one died but I'm so scared of school now"
"4699","This type of ""training"" is more to desensitize kids/teachers to the situation,,,that way when it actually happens...they do not panic or freeze up in fear. The military uses similar training,not only to pratice doing it...but to get over the fear of doing it.When you have trained for something it take some of the fear factor out and you might be able to act to save yourself"
"4700","They have so much shootings because the weapons are legally"
"4701","My old elementary school logic (no im not in elementary school xD) Ok class! Its the drill! Just hide in the corners and i need two very strong young men to put some desks near the door! Good job! Now lets just wait! I bet that custodian wont be able to open that door! Good job! Now we just have to wait while he checks the other doors! *waiting for like 15 minutes*. yay class we did it! Now lets discuss what would happen. If he comes in, you have to stay in the corner, or run!"
"4702","Your piece of shit husband was going 130 to get there and do what? Putting people's lives at risk isn't a good thing you Bimbo"
"4703","Do they announce on the intercom for a lockdown If there really is a shooter. Because in my school the principle says ""can Mr.lock please come to the office please"""
"4704","I wish my school had school shooting drills! They only do Fire Drills"
"4705","Locking the door won't do shit if there's a damn shooter. If they have a gun, news flash, they can shoot the handle and if that happens how convenient for the damn shooter, everyone just piled up in one corner so they wouldn't even have to search to find everyone and anyone. If there's a fucking lock down I'm getting the hell out of school and running home."
"4706","No no you cant use fake guns in drills it may trigger the students and make them feel  uncomfortable and violated"
"4707","great now the shooters know?!?"
"4708","Feel so sorry for u guys over there,"
"4709","Or you could actually allow certain people to have  guns in the school, not force everyone to cower in a group and potentially all get killed in a matter of seconds."
"4710","America will never learn"
"4711","I want Holly to be my teacher😂😂😂"
"4712","you are giving away the ways schools keep their kids safe."
"4713","I remembered a teacher telling me that in case a situation like that ever were to happen we would lock our door (our school doors are pretty solid) and lay under our desk while our principal go over the pa system and say ""rest and reflect"" "
"4714","my aunt went to columnin 🙁🙁🙁"
"4715","At my school the last time we did a drill like 3-4 years ago my teacher just locked the door, turned off the lights and went on like nothing was happening (high school only).  Me and one other kid actually took it seriously and almost got in trouble for it and we're made to look like fools.  If I really got into trouble I woukd just go to the office during the drill and had them find me and I woukd have just told them my chances are better out here and where can I report a teacher getting me into trouble for taking it seriously.  If they started disciplining me I woukd say how good would it be if I pulled out a camera and let the news community get there opinion of a top school doing this?"
"4716","School logic:  Oh! Just have them huddle up in the corner. One bullet will only kill 6 kids"
"4717","Guess what UK you have the highest stabbing rate in the world.  Why don't you have a background check for anyone buying a knife?  You should probably have a knife registry because your knife crimes are so out of control.  God your country is so crazy for letting you buy a knife.  SHAME ON YOU!"
"4718","I live in England. I am safe."
"4719","Did they not tell the kids? I would've cried I have a panic attack when there's a chase nearby. And they said they'll keep having theses unannounced drills, wtf? When there's a real one, the kids won't actually be ready"
"4720","I grab a pencil and make a 360 no scope in the mid of the bois head and back flip out the window"
"4721","same"
"4722","Yea same and the principle just says ""is anyone here?"""
"4723","at mine the try to open the door and the first drill scared me so so so muck"
"4724","At mine they bang on the door and attempt to open it"
"4725","+Synergy Sports XV Its not to assert dominance it's so provide protection. So in a hypothetical situation in which the US were to ban guns, the amount of people that would then attempt to make fake guns would dramatically increase. As well as if someone had made a gun and has an intent to use it of people since it was banned, it would result in higher casualties of gunman events. As well as the fact that it's a constitutional right that was passed down from when America was first created."
"4726","So Americans...why do you lot find it so hard to live without guns then? Do you need this materialistic possession to assert your dominance over the same species of human? Care to explain..."
"4727","+LordBayl Gaming The United States has NEVER been the greatest place in the world..."
"4728","+LordBayl Gaming​ You literally also just said that killing weapons should be allowed everywhere.  It's obvious that the US has way more gun crime than countries in Europe that ban guns.  Tell me about this ""Illegal guns"" BS.  People arn't usually willing to go through a massive proccess of smuggling guns and using them, in the case of just using another ""Less dangeous"" weapon.  Having special police forces having guns is a much better idea because they know what they are doing and there is a 99.9% chance that they will not it for illegal purposes.  "

"4760","Am i the only one who, instead of being a sitting duck, would stand around the corner with a chair, and the second the shooter came around, would beat him to a pulp?"

"4762","Do every American school have this or nah?"
"4763","She the teachers were throwing the gunman they were so bad, I'm a 13 year old girl and I do better. I can, and have, thrown a grown male adult he was over 150 -200 pounds (way heavier than me) and I picked him up off his feet and threw him over me. He was an instructor but he did not give me any help/ did not go easy on me. I haven't done tykwondo for  very long an I am still a low belt rank and I'm not that strong but I can do way better than than them."

"4776","I don't get why they have to make it realistic by having kids covered in blood/police with guns/having people act dead. No shit, some kids are going to be traumatized. At my school our thing is called ""intruder/lockdown drill"" and we sit in the corner of the room where the ""intruder"" won't be able to see us and the school principal & officers walk around and bang on the doors. That's pretty much it for our drill"
"4777","I just wish that instead of teaching people how to disarm someone with a gun, they don't let the person get the gun in the first place."
"4778","OR allow teachers or armed guards to carry"
"4779","The fact American schools have to do this show they have a HUGE problem"
"4780","Our school finally decided to change the rule that you are allowed to throw stuff and break open the windows to escape😉"
"4781","Ask the kids at Sandy Hook.  Of course they were no involved in the drill and December 14, 2012.  There were no kids there on that day.  The school wasn't even in operation."

"4784","My classmates take it as a joke, they will laugh loud, say things like ""we're in here"" and shit."
"4785","When they do drills at my school they make us sit UNDERNEATH THE VERY TALL CAFETERIA TABLES."
"4786","last year, in Lauderdale Lakes Middle School, it was a mix of a DRILL and a REAL Shooting. our principal announced a lockdown (it was a drill) and then from code red, it turned into a cold silence for two hours until we heard a helicopter pass above our class and a big thud in the classroom two doors away from ours. it was so scary that people actually sacrificed their jackets, seriously ripping off their sleeves to barricade and jam the door. people were crying, hugging each other, and confessing true feelings because we all thought it would be our last hours. then there was knocking on the door. we all knew who the hell it was from obvious training. we took books, pencils, everything to throw or either stab. then the door was somehow lockpicked and it opened. we threw, we ran and surged. then we realized it was an armored policeman. it was, as funny as it is to say, a fail, but those confessions changed friendships and either broke current ones or created new ones. If you read up to this point, you're awesome."
"4787","Damn 130 mph, they could've made him die"
"4788","when I was in school they locked the door."
"4789","How do shooters break in to schools anyways? Like seriously. Just get more security and make sure you lock school doors and gates."
"4790","Did anyone else think about the fact that when the principal comes over the intercom like ""locks, lights, out of sight!"" or whatever drill you're doing, the shooter would know exactly what to expect?"
"4791","This past year (my senior year of high school) we were told that there were three procedures when it came to a school shooting, and our teacher of that classroom was to choose which one we did. 1. The normal sitting-duck situation 2. barricade and get ready to fight 3. evacuate. That said, we never practiced the barricade drill. We weren't allowed to, because they didn't want us to scratch the new desks.

I'm visually impaired, and I felt so so vulnerable during all the situations. If I was facing down a gun, I feel as though I wouldn't be able to act fast enough even with training, because by the time I knew what was happening, I'd be dead. And the evacuation drill? Once we got outside, I had to slow my pace by about half because I didn't know the terrain as well. During this drill, we had to go to the police station nearby, but to do this we had to go down a steep hill with uneven terrain. Without my cane (which I usually keep in my locker during the day because I don't need it inside) I was nearly in tears. I was terrified and had to ask my teacher for help. In a real situation, I'd have to run. And I wouldn't know where to go. Everyone would scatter, because that's what people do when they're in a panic.

Honestly, we've been doing lock down drills since I was in kindergarten, and I still have no clue what to do."
"4792","I think its a fantastic idea maybe just warn the parents before hand. But I think drills like this are important ones"
"4793","My drills are no where near that intense! But I live in a small city where it will never happen 😂 all we do is go under the teachers desk and then eventually the school cop or whatever will come nock on the door or something with the principal. But ALL of my school's door artistically locks Di they have my chance of getting through the door and the window on the door theirs something over it that you can't really see though. But the stupid thing is is that kids still cry at my school when it's no where near that bad 😂"
"4794","It's 1 guy and 30 fucking kids and 2 adults. Pretty sure you can overpower one guy with an entire class of enraged cumlickers"
"4795","Boy who creid wolf"
"4796","Omg yes when i was a freshman we had a drill like this and my buddy James hit the active shooter with a fire extinguisher  and all of us guys took of running like pack of retards"
"4797","what really would happen:
.shooter walks in
.principal tells to lock down 
. everyone turns off and blocks and locks everything and goes in the corner
. the shooter corners them and that's it.."
"4798","I don't get wh u u sit in a corner. your cornering yourself... it will be an easy target for the shooter."
"4799","If someone came rolling in my school with a gun if be out a window so damn fast. Fuck sitting in a corner in the damn open. Get a heavy text book, scissors, or a pencil, and stab him!"
"4800","Let's throw fucking tennis balls at the shooter because it'll hurt alot"
"4801","hide in the bathroom"
"4802","It's so sad that people have to train for this kind of shit"
"4803","In my school we never have real lockdowns. But they never tell us if it's a drill. So we can hear footsteps outside the classroom. And then a teacher bangs and tries to open the door just to prepare us. 😒 So we all freak out 😂😂 "
"4804","this doesn't happen in the uk because we're not stupid enough to legalize guns"
"4805","I live in kind of a sketchy area, and frankly, these videos just scare me even more. We have like two lockdowns a year, but no shooters."
"4806","Once in 3rd grade we had a fire drill(not a practice) because a student forgot to take their bread roll out of the microwave😂😂😂"
"4807","I can see some asshole kid going in a school shooting telling people it's only a drill."
"4808","what a bunch of pussies if someones rolls into ma scoooool wit a gun i gon shoot dat niqqa real quik like BANG BANG BANG on his ass and den once i done wit him i gon teabag his nasty ass and take him to my home where i gon molest him"
"4809","The USA's gun laws are so bad that they have to have a school shooting drill? And Americans still think guns are a good idea?"
"4810","i was in a real lock down last year i was 10 now im 11. The guy came through the gym were i and my sister was and our classes and ijust started to cry and hug my bff"
"4811","columbine"
"4812","hahahahahha and you think the gunman is sitting there letting a women take her down. bro he could have punched her stabbed her and shooted her"
"4813","I wanna be a Colorado teacher now"
"4814","don't be a hero. everyone for themselfs"
"4815","Skyview. That school! 😂"
"4816","""Ok children,  let's all huddle under the desk and make it extremely easy for any shooter to shoot you."" Make sure you cover your head and don't look!"
"4817","""My husband almost got a ticket coming here yesterday, He was doing 130.""...Lol Bitch, if your husband would've been caughht doing 130, his car would be towed, and he'd be put in Jail. PLUS a ticket."
"4818","ya if a shooter busts through everyones dead"
"4819","I would be out that window"
"4820","YESSS HOLLY GO GURL"
"4821","Schools neeeeeeddd NEEEDDD NEEED training like this!!!!!!!!!!! To any one who reads this spread and take action I am a student and would feel much better with this training"
"4822","Unrealistic As Fuck"
"4823","We need this in every school"
"4824","I wish drills were taken this seriously at my school. Parents are too busy complaining that they are too ""scary."" But if drills were actually active like this at my school. I'm sure idiots wouldn't be laughing and talking during drills. Instead we just crowd in a corner."
"4825","they dont tell us its a fucking drill lol"
"4826","Yeah throw balls at him ya know who cares right its just some fucking insane person with a gun yeah get all the kids to wait there then fucking throw balls at the cunt while the teacher *attempts* to tackle him to the ground and do multiple teachers sit in one room or just when some physic with a gun comes to the school honestly it wont me like that when its legit."
"4827","That school is just messed up. Why would they do such a thing like that?"
"4828","What if the gun man was holding it in the wrong hand"
"4829","well. the police officers during the columbine massacre didn't do anything to save the students."
"4830","If they are bunched up in a corner than they would be way easier to kill."
"4831","What the fuck."
"4832","And if some maniac comes in with a crowbar and breaks the god damn door down?

""oh no what do we do now"""
"4833","I wish my school did more stuff like this. We lock the door and huddle in a corner with the lights off and pretend like that would actually save us"
"4834","So scary for little one why dont they notice that there are little kids so dumd 💩"
"4835","this si why I sneak my weapons to school"
"4836","Our lock down is similar than you we go hide our own desk and plus we don't have courtains"
"4837","In my school the teacher locks the doors, turn off the lights and everything and we sit under our desks really quiet. I mean, we have to wait under our desks? To die? Btw once when I was in kindy we got robbed"
"4838","We go into a closet and we have to be really quiet."
"4839","We don't even do drills"
"4840","u americans are so fucking retarded"
"4841","I wanna go to there school now"
"4842","Install doors backwards so the entry is on the inside of the room.  Only thing that can knock that door down is a bartering ram and 10 minutes!  He could shoot the hinges off, but that would take a while and waste ammo."
"4843","The longest I had was 3h"
"4844","Maybe they should do this in UK schools as well!"
"4845","hell nah. an intruder comes in ill tackle his ass. andfight with all i got"
"4846","Imagine if the school said they was having a lockdown but an actual school shooter shot up the school"
"4847","i remember once we had a shooting drill and right before the drill starter this kid when to the bathroom while we were waiting for the drill to end the kid came back and started banging the door xD even though the teachers told us not to bang the doors if we are locked out"
"4848","My school does this"
"4849","I feel like posting videos like this can help the crimanel come up with a plan that would beat what these schools are teaching the teachers. At the same time it is a great idea because it is bringing awareness to the students and teachers that this could happen and they need to prepare for this possibility."
"4850","No this drill is incredible effective! The kids need to suck it up. We do it sometimes and it teaches us what to do in case of emergency!
Not only that, but there are better drills out there. Instead of hiding, my school and many other around our district encourage that we either run out of the building and as far away as we can, if we can, or we can barricade the door with desks and book shelves. In some cases if the shooter gets in the room that we fight back."
"4851","I kinda like this. The previous school shootings the victims never fight. It's about time those shooting drills evolve."
"4852","That is a badass teacher"
"4853","Just leave the school and don't get killed"
"4854","Hey guns make people safe so give the kids guns as well I'm sure that will work."
"4855","We don't even need fucking drills because in the uk people don't have guns."
"4856","It was just a prank"
"4857","Fuck that id throw chairs and block the door and stand near the door so we can tackle him or her if there was no easy out. What's the point of being sitting ducks?"
"4858","I never have had a school shooting drill, but I have had ""lockdown"" drills where we just sit in the corner of the room in the dark until the principal unlocks the door. They just started adding the fire alarm in the mix so we know not to go in the hall during a lockdown even if the fire alarm was pulled."
"4859","No. It's really scary"
"4860","no"
"4861","We were so scared"
"4862",">School shooter applies for teacher
this is gonna go well!1!"
"4863","+mvol5973 True point, I just don't trust those teachers, and I doubt the state governments would want to finance all the training and equipment."
"4864","+Kbholla
If properly concealed, kids have no idea the teacher even has it"
"4865","+mvol5973 Not really. You assume that they would have time to react. I don't trust people. They are largely moronic in general, and panic under pressure for the most part. "
"4866","Ugh my classmates do that too"
"4867","My friends are like that"
"4868","Lmfao prob a bad idea to do it in a real lockdown tho e.e"

"4873","After sandy hook they built 10 foot fences at my school they curve over too😂😂
When we r at recess we joke that we are in jail"
"4874","+Vanessa Zaga I wasn't in the school when it happened I wasn't alive "
"4875","+Jesse Johnson I hope this is a troll, if not you are the most retarded person on this planet."
"4876","+Silent Gaming Why would I suggest what ? Hide in a better place then all in a corner ? Well hmmm the shooters goal is to kill as many as he can and then probably end his own life....now if they hide in multiple better places like not in the class which is obvious then less deaths will occur!   That's why I would suggest that ;) less people to find , less people to kill !"
"4877","+Rayed Hamayun You idiot....How about hide somewhere better ? As soon as you enter the classroom you just need to look to the right and you see a big mountain of children -.- shoot once or twice with a shotgun and basically all of them are hurt at the same time."

"4886","Exactly! One day the UK will have attacks in schools and we need to be prepared for them."
"4887","Yeah, we have never even talked about school shootings at my school"
"4888","Am I the only one that noticed that the shades the teachers pull down in the drills could show which rooms have people in them?"
"4889","I wouldn't mind sacrificing my life I know death will come sooner or later......"
"4890","Hold up... the opening statement was, ""How to strike a perfect balance between preparing kids and scaring kids""? ""The trauma is real""?
I suppose dying isn't as traumatizing. I suppose the perfect balance is risking a life over someone's 'trauma'."
"4891","3:50 Get Rekt bro"
"4892","They did this at my school but they warned the entire community before it happend. They sent Robo-calls to all the parents and even put it on the new twice that all the schools in my district would have active shooter drills."
"4893","boi drop the nigga with the arm then take the gun and shoot right in the ass next thing u know he pees the bullet"
"4894","if a dude knows about this video he will know that you'll be behind a desk, 1 grenade and its all over, DONT RECORD THIS SHIT god damn"
"4895","me"
"4896","This sounds stupid yet genus try to fit the whole class in a closet or try to hide turn the lights off put a sign in the door thats says we are in the computer room testing when he looks in the room and comes in if he does lock him in untill the police get there and evacuate the school so its basically a decoy and trap"
"4897","if a whole class of 6th grade students attacked one single person with a gun there no doubt that the whole class would win"
"4898","That's what my school does"
"4899","One day when I was in 2nd grade there was a shooting at my school and we were all calm like they know that there was a shooter around but we're just doing the nights homework and then when they actually heard the shots pretty much ever student went behind me😂they legit said that because they trust me more than everyone to hide behind"
"4900","They ahould do this at my school"
"4901","I'm kinda scared that a shooting happens at my school"
"4902","Americans be like its soccer not football But Europeans be like its a school not a shooting range"
"4903","""When I look at those kids I think about how great they are, how lucky I am to teach them, and I wonder what they would be like when they grow up."" 


That list bit was kinda random xD"
"4904","I live in Australia and at my school we have neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr had a shooting"
"4905","Instead of scaring kids and making their parents think that their children are going to die, have a little assembly about how to stay safe in a situation like a school shooting. I can't imagine how it'd feel to get a text or a call from my children that there's someone in their class with a gun just to find out that it's a ""drill"". Sure I'd be happy that it's not a real shooter but the fact that this is how they think they should teach kids to protect themselves in this situation is absolutely messed up. They need to fix the school system's way of thinking."
"4906","wow"
"4907","Yes, let's all huddle up behind a desk. We'll be safe.."
"4908","Lockdown's won't do Crap if someone wants to get in that room with a crowbar a gun or even there foot.   It's stupid to think that oh yeah i will be quiet and hide with the rest of my friends in a room with a bolt lock and a wood door and hope that the shooter is dumb enough to think that no one is at the school.  It gives a false since of security."
"4909","😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱"
"4910","This school is really close to my school"
"4911","what happens when there are to gun men"
"4912","I think it's a great idea to keep kids safe but I think teachers should be able to have a gun locked up in classrooms to be used as last defense!!.. If they have nothing to defend with they are fish in a barrel!. Unless the kids get up and run for there lives!!.."
"4913","They wouldn't have to be this stupid for a lockdown drill if they were actually smart when it comes to gun control and background checks"
"4914","i want to do that in a real drill"
"4915","Hi. Probably don't hide under desks if you're not cornered. Try to run in zig zag (not straight) and carry a hard object as shield (maybe a book, ipad to your head while running in a zig zag if you can. Throw book anything if you're cornered. God bless. God bless. Rev. 21:4"
"4916","FUCK! I AM GOOD!"
"4917","the drill is useless, more like a joke..."
"4918","Only in Florida"
"4919","why doesn't my school do this"
"4920","hey look!  its Sandy Hook all over again!"
"4921","We don't even get these in our school"
"4922","bunch of fucking pussies"
"4923","We never ever had a drill like that where i live (canada) except when a fucking kid accidentally kicked a hidden button"
"4924","now I'm scared to  go  to  school"
"4925","I think it gives a false sense of security. Fighting back should be a last resort!"
"4926","gay"
"4927","""innocent"" children? 
Fuck off"
"4928","School shooters happen when he hates everyone in school"
"4929","In my school, if a fire drill starts, everyone shits their pants and screams"
"4930","This is so sad :("
"4931","BITCH IF YOU DON""T WANT STUDENTS HURT, THEN TEACH THEM TO RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE!!! FUCKING SCHOOLS JUST LET BULLYING GO ON AND EVEN ENCOURAGE IT!!!   PARENTS HAVE TO FUCKING PUT THEIR KIDS ON A  LEASH!  ERIC AND DYLAN WERE HEROES!!!!"
"4932","now that's a real good teacher"
"4933","Fucking flashbacks"
"4934","Fuck that, I'd grab a chair, bang the glass window and jump. Then I'd run more faster than a speeding NASCAR to anyone's home, bang until they answer and grab the nearest phone & dial 911. I already got it planned of what I'm going to do to save MY life first & others if I have time. I think about these things cause shit, more people being bullied or having a crazy mindset of killing people..hell yea I'mma have a plan."
"4935","When Lauren Marionneaux get 18 then I'm banging."
"4936","The problem isn't guns. It's the fact that Americans pump their kids full of psychoactive meds when they're young and it fucks them up.

Look at major school shooting incidents. Most of the people that committed them have been hopped up on anti ADHD meds or Anti depressants. If the school teachers stopped acting like boys being a bit rough and tumble was an illness, kids wouldn't be on meds in 2nd grade."
"4937","Y do people make this public like really.....how do u know that some killer isnt watching....."
"4938","Lol ""No Tobacco - Libre de Tobacco"" Nice intergration of immigrants"
"4939","Fuck I love Australia"
"4940","Why dont you just put all the students and teachers on Krav maga?"
"4941","Simple solution: 1) All schools have armed guards 2) Give teachers guns."
"4942","My teacher is named Kelly nolan"
"4943","Tip with a guns
1. if it on you (like the chest) it's very easy to move
2. You want to take the gun away, once you do that they loose their confidence (Endless they are really mentally ill)
I can't think of anymore... Hope you keep those in mind."
"4944","Just a prank bro. Just a harmless prank bro. BRO, BRO ITS JUST A PRANK!!! BRO! BRO! BRO BACK OFF ITS JUST A PRANK!"
"4945","Oh, I dunno. Gun laws."
"4946","if a real shooting happened to me i would have... 1) Hidden with my best friend somewhere not obvious. 2) After everything is over i wouldve ran home 3)Move to homeschool"
"4947","My high school has never had a lockdown drill. We've had ""restrictive movement"" drills, but that's just an excuse for policemen to bring in canines to sniff for drugs. We just stay in our classrooms and go on like a normal day, the only thing is that we can't leave the classroom for any reason."
"4948","in our school in the phiippnea we th throw our trolleys"
"4949","i think it COULD actually help... especially because when the real thing is happening, the shooter is expecting people to be hiding. so being on full alert, standby mode, you know 4 or 5 people all ready to fucking tackle the bastard down and having one of those 5 people assigned to grabbing the shooters arm/gun might really work. then tie his ass up while hes down or sum shit"
"4950","Expectations 
""Get behind my desk please."" 
*everyone gets behind desk*
*waits a few minutes*
*shooter walk in*
Shooter: dangit. I cannot get to these people stuck in a corner who would be completely immobile from getting away from me, a guy with A GUN. I guess I should leave. I have been outsmarted.

The Sad Reality
""Get behind my desk please""
Me: how about no
Teacher: cmon GET BEHIND MY DESK OR ILL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS. YOURE PUTTING OUR LIVES AT RISK!!""
Me: *hesitantly and confusedly* a-alright, hakuna your tattas 
*everyone gathers behind desk*
*shooter walks in*
*sees everyone crammed in corner where they can't get away*
Shooter: lol wtf?? 
Me: I TRIED TELLING HER THAT THIS WAS A DUMB IDea BUT NOOOO I HAVE TI RESPECT MY ELDERS! WELL GUESS WHAT? ILL RESPECT MY ELDERS WHEN MY ELDERS REspec ME! DOUCES MI AMIGOS, IM OUT!!
Shooter: *too confused and let's me walk out and gives the rest of the school time walk out unharmed while he contemplates what just happened and his life choices*"
"4951","lol if I was a school shooter I would have blasted everyone before they could pick up something"
"4952","Only in America LMFAO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"4953","So how exactly does sitting at the back of the class as one group help, wouldn't that make it easier for the shooter?"
"4954","they should used a fake school for there testing but no they had to use a real school while classes where in session scaring the crap out of kids and staff and they suppose to save in protect some police"
"4955","I would cops do a dill like that talk about save and protect"
"4956","whats the point on hiding in the corner ? I would have played dead"
"4957","why would u scream thats dumb"
"4958","I'm in calorado how scary"
"4959","in my school there are no walls or doors in the classrooms and the windows arent see through and in our drills they just make us sit by the board with our heads down"
"4960","I'm in Canada so my school doesn't even need to practice this stuff"
"4961","I think to be a teacher they should have this kind of certified training."
"4962","I would be a ninja waaa"
"4963","This will definitely work I feel safer already. If a shooter comes to my school I will just shit my pants and cry, since I'm not trained like these black ops teachers."
"4964","This is school, teacher grabs some scissors and tries to stab the guy in the neck... (not safety scissors though)"
"4965","JESUS THOSE POOR CHILDREN"

"4991","No u"
"4992","When I was in elementary, the shooting drill is just 2 steps:
1. Lock door
2. Hide in corner
... that's all"
"4993","6:50 If you're in the opposing corner of the room and the gunman is in the doorway you're royally fucked. If you fight back you have a small chance of succeeding with a couple causalities or all dying without even trying."
"4994","I support shooter drills I think they'll save lives in the future but drills alone aren't going to do much to save and protect people. I know a lot of schools already have school resource officers but we could do more to protect students by posting them at all school entrances and by better arming them. Obviously, no system will be perfect but I think it's about time we did more to sturdy up school entrances to help prevent a shooter from even getting into school. I don't want to turn school into prisons but these days it seems like that's the only way we can pretty much guarantee there won't be another mass shooting at a school. We need to have a network of emergency doors that can be selectively shut from a control room somewhere in the school to limit the access of a shooter."
"4995","In my school there's a bush but idk if I should hide in there if it happens. The bushes is high and against the wall"
"4996","Honestly, I think this is a great method, but no one should have to prepare for a school shooting.."
"4997","Just let teachers keep some mace in their desks. If i'm in a room with an active shooter i'm not going to fuck around hiding behind a desk..."
"4998","My school was told to not go into a corner and hide but break the bars of the desks and fight"
"4999","This is the norm now I guess..."
"5000","Why doesn't America ban guns tell me how easy would it be to occupy or invade America when just about all of its 350,000,000 people are armed to the teeth in weapons. It wouldn't be easy that's for sure"
"5001","idk 4 years ago i was at school and we were in a lock down alert because someone killed someone or something like that next to thr school and i lived next to school we were in the class sleepig and being quite for 6 hours then  he got arrested in front of my street my dad had picked me up from school and my street was compeltly full of police and armed men and i live in missouri so this isnt common at all we only do lockdown drills like twice a year.. and then when it happened we all thought it was a drill until we were there for hours so idk i was just sitting there i think ieven fell asleep.. i wasn't even scared because i thoght it was a drill and i new it wasn't when i saw my street i live on  flooded with cops.. we was latef arrested near were i live and i just went inside and played some xbox like nothing ever happened because i was retarded"
"5002","How about you just take a chair, smash a window, and fucking jump out. I wouldn't care if I broke a leg, it's better than dying."
"5003","We had a lockdown at my school. In my class 5 people where sent to the principle because they got up and pretended to be the shooter."
"5004","my school was on lockdown one time because there was a shooter on the lose close to are school.. It was so scary"
"5005","Pulling down the shade is a bad idea actually"
"5006","Since when does sitting in a corner stop bullets? Fucking barricade the door and grab anything that can serve as a weapon. The whole hide under your table shit is fucking retarded"
"5007","So... who would go into a school to shoot it up with only a small handgun XD seems like it would be much more likely for someone to go in with a rifle of some kind, like an AR or AK most likely."
"5008","I cry for lock downs even if it's a drill they never say if it's real or if it's fake it's just an alarm😣"
"5009","At my school we have lockers inside and me move them against the door"
"5010","Little shits, you're not supposed to use your cell phone in a lock down. If it were real and the suspect had a bomb in the school the text/call could interfere with the signal of the bomb and set it off."
"5011","They don't work"
"5012","This kind of School shooting drill is better than the ones we have. We just cower in the corner like a bunch of cowards."
"5013","America!"
"5014","I'm glad this is happening"
"5015","Just like tornado drills and fire drills, this is sadly  now an ingrained part of our everyday lives and the parents need to suck it up and get over it. Be grateful the school is having these drills and putting protective measures in place in case (God Forbid) a crisis like this unfolds. Don't be little bitches about it."
"5016","Some parents are so stupid 😑"
"5017","Rear naked choke perhaps"
"5018","This shouldn't even be a thing."
"5019","I'd try to stab the Fuka wit a pencil"
"5020","I heard a story about school staff finding a uzi in a kids locker"
"5021","In my school my teacher has two bats one for him and one for the strongest boy or girl in the class."
"5022","it just makes it easier for the shooter to cram all of the children in the corner of the room"
"5023","The thing is if this becomes a regular drill like fire drills, surely students will get used to it just being a drill and lot worry like we do with fire drills"
"5024","Why don't they just baracade the door?"
"5025","Stoopid ass kids!!! Arent they fking warned that they cant tell anyone outside that their being fked?!!!"
"5026","I wish my drills were like this and I'm in high school. My lockdowns are just sitting in a corner and people are talking. That's not a drill."
"5027","wow, so this is how they do these false flags."
"5028","so does every school in America do this?"
"5029","For drills at my school we lock the doors and sit at our desks while the teacher keeps teaching...like really? im gonna die."
"5030","We don't do shit like this. Our first period teachers 99% of the time tell us we're going to have a lockdown then we have one and we literally go up against the wall next to the door and stay there for about 2 minutes."
"5031","My teacher always has to be by me, or else I'll frisk out and start crying 😂"
"5032","That sort of thing happened at my school, and we had to sneak past the police officers and legit run away from him down the road."
"5033","we just hunch over under our desks…we're gonna die"
"5034","A shooter was at my school and I had a lot of sharp pencils and I stabbed him rp death"
"5035","There are shootings everyday at my school."
"5036","These bitches hiding behind a 1cm thin ass desk lmao... might as well jump out of the window for better safety or play hide n seek hiding behind the door when he opens and RUN BICH"
"5037","Great thinking schools,  put everybody in a corner. Ohhh America sometimes....."
"5038","At my school we just do the drill part we never have a fake gun person or cops"
"5039","why did the teacher put the clothes pin on the blind/share tf"
"5040","I feel like that's always the problem with these shootings nobody acts to stop 1 guy there was probably more than 1000 people in that nightclub and nobody tried to stop him"
"5041","wouldn't it be easier if they made it much harder to get into schools"
"5042","L"
"5043","I like going to school in the UK more after watching this."
"5044","I have smacked a fake bad guy with a chair"
"5045","If you hear gun shots and your in the hallway is it a good idea to run outside and hide out there"
"5046","Why don't they throw golf balls, that packs a good punch"
"5047","who else is about to shoot up their school. comment and like"
"5048","This video breaks my heart."
"5049","I remember in elementary school, the principal played the bad guy and one class had to climb out the window. Just this past year, they said there was a drill and I ducked under a desk and realized ""crap, I'm literally in front of the door."""
"5050","Me if I was in a school shooting when outside SHIIIIIIII IM OUT *gets some friends and jumps the fence* (at my house) LETS HAVE A PAAAAAAARTAAAAAAYYYY!😂😂😂😂 Edit: Lmfao this is so fucking cringy"
"5051","i would tell my crush and best friend and the squad to follow me cause there is no time and if i see the school shooter i would disarm him and threaten to shoot him XD"
"5052","Instead of finding ways to survive school shootings why doesn't the US start proventing them by banning guns?"
"5053","Our school's drills take 30 minutes!"
"5054","What a horrible, horrible idea... Tell them it's a drill."
"5055","Imagine a paintball war in school"
"5056","that's what my school needs...we need drills like that with pretend gunmen"
"5057","America is fucked"
"5058","Ye mi techers arnt that hot"
"5059","""Heh, nice lock"" *Destroys lock*"
"5060","I came for the comments *Grabs popcorn*"
"5061","In my school in lockdown drills we use chains to lock the doors and pile our desks to block the doors. Only locking the door won't help anything."
"5062","That school should be sued for doing that to innocent young children"
"5063","Whatever who cares"
"5064","in my school we don't do these drills ...."
"5065","This is ridiculous. Rubber balls? I'd keep a couple Louisville Sluggers in my cabinet as a teacher.. No joke. I'd distribute them to a couple of the students who volunteer to stop the intruder with me."
"5066","Preparing for Martial Law!Omg its around the corner"
"5067","I like the DRILLS but 5 minutes, our longest was like 1:30 hour"
"5068","Once at my school somebody pulled a police alarm, and a recorded message told us that it was NOT a test.  Usually the teachers would know beforehand, so THEY were genuinely scared.  I sneezed and just then the door jiggled.  I thought my allergies would kill us all."
"5069","At my school they don't have the police pretend to shoot the kids they just have the police try to open the doors"
"5070","It's so obvious to tell that the trainers aren't trying, if it were real shooter(s) and actually trying to kill the kids, they would get fucked up by the shooter(s) easily."
"5071","At my old middle school, our lockdown drill was us (the students and the teachers) sitting out in the open at our desks, doing nothing one of the doors into our room were locked and the blinds were closed"
"5072","Our school does it for 20 mins"
"5073","1:22 WHAT A FUCKING SNITCH"
"5074","I think I was told that there hasn't been a school shooting in over 40 years in England"
"5075","this is why every school needs a bunker like room in the classrooms incase of this"
"5076","In my old school, they say ""the super intendant is on the building"" as the warning so the shooter won't know that the kids are being protected"
"5077","In my high school we had a couple of teachers, generally the ones in the shop class rooms that had doors or garages that led directly outside that told us during lock downs ""If we go into a lock down and you run out those doors, i wont stop you. But if you do make sure you keep your hands up and face visible, or the police are taking you out before you reach the road"""
"5078","La Salle lockdowns and fire drills are so freakin serious that if you crack your knuckles during the lockdown drill, this one kid got suspended, cause he did that"
"5079","At my school we haven't had a drill yet"
"5080","At my school, we, the students, were told to throw whatever is in that corner that we're in at the shooter. We only did it in 5th grade but I feel like it helped to know we could do something, even as the little children."
"5081","when the lady said her husband was doing 130 in a almost ten year old Audi convertible, I just shook my head."
"5082","Should use a paintball pistol in these drills to get somewhat of an evaluation of how many casualties there will be."
"5083","How come the teachers have all the fun?? XD"
"5084","they should use golf balls"
"5085","This is why kids font need cell phones"
"5086","wtf is this? just use your gun xD you live in america ffs"
"5087","But what if he has two pistols?"
"5088","If you are going to die, die fighting."
"5089","0:41 thank guy just got a triple collateral"
"5090","does anybody think about using the fire extinguisher to distract the shooter than hit him with it?"
"5091","Hell no im running why sit in a Corner and just let the person shoot me"
"5092","My chem teachers would grab acids to throw at them and would throw ammonia outside the door if it was real"
"5093","+Broncosdude 18 xD"
"5094","+ThatOneKiwi yeah right you will fight.."
"5095","+Broncosdude 18 hahahahah"
"5096","It's not how they do all of them in my school we just sit in the safe spot no throwing things or cops"
"5097","+Amylxb I live In USA and don't have those drills"
"5098","+Games Daily wow, that's so weird. In England I don't think we've ever even talked about school shootings lol"
"5099","Well, we do have drills to duck and cover, turn off the lights and stay quiet but not with the police officers acting as the bad guys or any sort of help with the police"
"5100","Although I did have a middle school teacher who put a box full of super sharp scissors and we all grabbed one and he said if this is ever real and the gunman tried to get into the room just stab the hell out of him"
"5101","+Wonder Struck His name is fucking GoldieBloxGames and he cries in a lock-down. Its justified."
"5102","why are you guys cursing them out!?"
"5103","Pussy"
"5104","+Andres Hinojosa what kinda small ass club is that still tho even if they're were only 50 someone could've done something  "
"5105","more than 1000? there were about 100-200 at the night club"
"5106","At least we don't have nearly as many violent crimes, break ins, or muggings. Not to mention the number of stabbings since guns where banned"
"5107","+22Laxer22 yeah canada is a very peaceful country.. they have only had a couple shootin in the past 20 years.. vs 1 a month in the us"
"5108","Nooo go to Canada"
"5109","Video or its fake lol"
"5110","bull shit"
"5111","Who did you crush?"
"5112","Please be joking"
"5113","+GodIsImaginary Of course I've noticed guns. I live in the fucking boonies of Canada. There guns everywhere."
"5114","+Jeremy Pullet yet have you noticed any guns? Marijuana legalisation won't result in 30 kids getting innocently murdered every other week.  And you can grow weed in big bulk in the UK, do you think a single person make as many guns as the amount of weed one person could grow? And if one person gets some weed, can i use that to kill unsuspecting kids as they whistle away in maths class? I don't care what you do to yourself, its your body, but if it results in you causing pain or death on other innocent people, is that fair? If you can  or Billy Mays can give me one good solid argument about why guns should be legal, that doesn't include 'to protect us from people with guns' then i will respond in a dignified manner, and offer a real debate."
"5115","+GodIsImaginary Marijauna is illegal. People get that all the time."
"5116","+Billy Mays you don't fucking learn do you. You only need a gun to protect yourself if someone else has a gun on you. The reason you are clinically retarded is because you don't read, understand or respond to my points, instead you do one of two things. Say ""I live in the US"" which after the fourth time i would expect that everyone and their cat knew about that. Secondly, you will say ""we need guns to protect ourselves, guns don't kill people etc. etc."" Yet you don't seem to be able to comprehend what I've stated (along with others) over five times, ""if you make guns illegal, they won't get have these guns!"" and before you come at me with that black market bullshit ill direct you to my previous comments that responded to exactly that. Twice. So you really think giving someone a gun to protect themselves from someone with a gun is good idea? Or maybe banning guns so neither would have them would be better? These kids would be left with getting a knife or making their own bomb. In which case, why don't we arm everyone with a bomb! Actually, now that i think about it, after the 9/11 events, why don't we give everyone a Boeing 777 so they can combat these terrorist hijackers! I mean, if you listened to yourself, and maybe stepped out of the box you were  brought up to be kept in, you would understand this very BASIC argument which you can't properly combat! And your second Amendment? What a bunch of shit. You had laws on slavery, your happy thats been abolished! Yet obviously slavery is one thing, where as school shootings is completely different! Why care about the 30 kids that get shot in the school shooting every other week WHEN WE CAN SHOOT OPEN OUR BEER CANS WITH OUR RIFLES!!! YEAAAAH! Stupid, infantile, naive and most evidently inbred. Welcome to America, the land of unnecessary shootings in return for owning a handgun!"
"5117","You WOULD care. I would rather save many lives, potentially risking my own, than let my classroom become a slaughter house, knowing I did nothing to try and prevent it.
Your comment makes me think your a heartless person."
"5118","If u were there, u would care bitch"
"5119","+Anthony Cardenas Even then they would still get fucked up"
"5120","you would all get massacred, you should all ambush when he comes in"
"5121","I don't have to do that I'm glad I don't live in fucking America"
"5122","One time at school we were talking about lockdowns. I said if they came in scream ATTACK! We him in a place by dictionary's, scissors, and books. A shooters worst nightmare"
"5123","at my school, students do this too, but the ""gun man"" is actually a police officer..."
"5124","Clearly just a troll. Any smart American would bring a fucking RPG to school to fuck up shooters."
"5125","Those parents rushing to the school like they would do something if there was an active shooter."
"5126","HOLY SHIT SOMEONE ALMOST GOT A TICKET FUCK! THAT'S SO FUCKING EDGY!"
"5127","She beat his ass"
"5128","Why the fuck i am watching the shit"
"5129","you got me fucked up I'm leaving that school I ain't staying in that school if he is trying to kill me! shit"
"5130","They should do a rko by randy orton"
"5131","I bet its a white guy"
"5132","ugh... for me.... when that once happen I just brought my hockey stick and hit the man."
"5133","Why don't they have metal baseball bats in school to smack the shit out of these physchos."
"5134","Once in my class we didn't get told that we were having a lock in and everyone in my class was laughing and making so much noise"
"5135","""It's only a drill bro"""
"5136","5 minutes is the longest drill?! Wtf I had one for like 20 minutes!"
"5137","I think here it would be a disaster, kids would be flinging themselves at the fake shooter 😂"
"5138","@What's Inside"
"5139","GG America."
"5140","Just give every teacher a 45"
"5141","Just don't teach them to hide under their fucking tables, we all know how the columbine shooting went."
"5142","I wish that I had a school shooting here in Britain, it would be fun you know? like an intense game of hide n seek lmao"
"5143","I like how I found this when I was looking up ""What is Middle School like"""
"5144","even my teacher said he will break the window and get us all out no way in hell am going to die at my fucking school FUCK SCHOOL"
"5145","The longest lockdown drill I have ever had was like 30 minutes"
"5146","Yeah I understand the principle, but in this case wouldn't evacuating be a better cause of action? The shooter most probably wouldn't want to go outside since police would be able to shoot hem then..."
"5147","WTF. Why are the kids sitting there! Our teachers during the drill make us grab things and get ready to fight!"
"5148","If there was a shooting at my school, I won't run out, I'll get the laptops or chairs and throw them at the shooter. I'll make sure the gun is not near him. I'm gonna try to make them unconscious"
"5149","I would go to where the door opens and when he walks in i would jump on them and bite them and jck them in the wrong place"
"5150","I think every school should have a security guard or a off-duty police officer."
"5151","When she tackled him one last time it made me cheer her on! My parents thought I was crazy because I had headphones on."
"5152","My school doesn't do school shooting drills, because if they did if there was a school shooting the student would know exactly what will happen and can prepare for it and plan around it."
"5153","My Favorite Indoor Shooting Range Is Columbine High School"
"5154","the longest one our school was really scary and 1hr. 10min."
"5155","I live in england so we dont get so many crazy people with aks but if there was ever a gunman at my school id just get everyone to get out there compassess and when the guy comes in have the fat guy pounce on him and we all shank him"
"5156","I have learned this type of stuff from a Narcotics officer and a former marine, and I must say, these are some similar tactics that I was taught."
"5157","If school shooting has become a serious issue we don't need teachers with guns or tasers, just give every single one in every class a fire extinguisher. Think of it this way, if the shooter comes in through the door a teacher could be hiding right beside the entrance,  then could use the extinguisher to fill the shooters lungs with ice cold carbon dioxide, and possibly blind them and proceed to bash their heads with the extinguisher. This way an extinguisher can be used both for fire drills and stopping a shooter from harming someone in a class."
"5158","its like boy cried wolf some time kids are going to think its fake but its real"
"5159","Why are they just sitting in a big pile? Why don't just evacuate through the window? If the shooter sees a door with the blinds closed then he knows someone is in there, and then it's just a matter of time before he gets in if he really wants too..."
"5160","Omg I would love that for people to come in my school with guns man that was lit"
"5161","Wow. I thought my school was bad. We do two bomb/shooting drills a year. During each, we go into the corner of the room, where we are not visible from any window or door, and lock the doors. We stay there, pretty much silent, until the principal comes and tells us to walk down, with the rest of our grade, to the gymnasium, where we will be dismissed from school. But a man acting as if he is a school shooter? Nah, our school would never do this"
"5162","We had a fire alarm at school and a fireman came and all of that stuff but they didn't call our parents instead they took us back into the building and I was sitting there like 
OMG"
"5163","SCHOOL PRANK (GONE WRONG) (GUN PULLED)"
"5164","What would an active shooter situation look like when I was at school? Me gettin my ass out of there. Theres not a chance in hell I would have stuck around on the wall of a classroom waiting several minutes for the shooter to get to our room and off us like sitting ducks..."
"5165","It's stupid, do you really think the shooter is gunna be like, OH MY GOD NO ONES HERE! WELL I MUST LEAVE THEN!"
"5166","Three letters, and three letters only: W. T. F."
"5167","Ye like, hiding under a desk is gonna protect you againts bullets. Why smash the damm window and run out hu?"
"5168","now this is why we dont sell guns in the uk"
"5169","Or they could just have iron bars infront of the door. problem=solved"
"5170","My question is, what if theres some fucked up kid with a knife/gun in the class the 'fake shooter', walks into and its just a drill, he fucked up."
"5171","If there was a school shooting, I would just climb out a window and run or something, I wouldn't be sitting around some teachers desk just waiting for the shooter to come in and shoot us up."
"5172","You know USA is a fucked up country when they need a school shooting drill. God bless 'Merica! Thank god my school only needs 2 drills! earthquake and fire drills."
"5173","I like that teacher. Everything that she says is real, she's a true role model"
"5174","Once I hear code red I'm out. Fuck hiding in the class I'm out that bitch."
"5175","did they lock the doors"
"5176","I did Columbine School Shooting it was just a drill gone wrong"
"5177","We have these things it goes inside the room and they say it takes more than 22 or 21 hits from a sledgehammer and there's a video on YouTube and they have a police man trying to brake into the door and in all the weapons he used to brake in he didn't succeed in any of them"
"5178","I support these drills, but if something like Columbine happens then the student shooters know the exact plan that the school has. Therefore, giving them an advantage."
"5179","Thank fuck i live in england"
"5180","The last thing you want to do is to make the situation worse by making the crazy shooter even more angry and he will take this out on the students and anybody that gets on its way. Only police officers or teachers who have a permit to carry a gun can stop a person carrying a gun that is trying to shoot you. You need a gun to stop a gun."
"5181","Just put a furry in the school, the school shooter will kill himself"
"5182","This is y I come with a knife at schoole so I can kill the nigga dead and be famous and get bitches it's pretty legit plan just need to find the most weirdest kids in school and are wight"
"5183","I work at a gym and when I was just starting I had do an active shooter test to make sure what to do during an active shooter situation"
"5184","fucking retarded american how about you ban guns AMERICA IS FUCKING RETARDED I CANT EVEN HANDLE THE RETARDNESS"
"5185","We had one terrorism-related drill at school (or maybe it was a hoax I don't remember). The teacher would say someone had planted a bomb and everyone would awkwardly leave the building and stand not far away from the buildings for 20 minutes scratching our heads, then everyone would just go home without asking the teacher (keke) because it was a nice opportunity to skip classes. No school shootings in my country, the worst we had was when some idiot threw a chair at the school cop and broke his leg"
"5186","if there was a shooter you know what I would do I'll get the scissors and cut him tell he dies"
"5187","I think the teachers should have guns"
"5188","We should do this in Britain"
"5189","I live in the UK and we will never have to do these drills."
"5190","Are you fucking kidding me? The main goal of a shooter is to kill as many people as possible, putting kids together in small room will only make that job easier. If there is a shooting at my school I'm jumping out of the window and hauling ass out of there and running home."
"5191","Every class should just have a bar that goes over the door and a boiling pot of oil to poor on their heads while they try to break in"
"5192","Imagine how fucking awkward it would be if two kids decided to shoot up the same school on the same day"
"5193","America"
"5194","she is so pretty💕💕💕💕💕"
"5195","2534675548 School shooters watched this video."
"5196","Shooter walks in and sees both the football team and the kids that always beat up other kids. ""FUCK THIS SHIT I'M OUT!"""
"5197","You call THAT proper training? What if the killer gets his gun up, points at the teacher, and shoots while they're on the ground? Personally, if I was a teacher, I would pick up something strong to hit them with, something sharp to stab them with, or even get their gun out of their hands THEN do hand-to-hand combat. All three of these options are good to request the students' help as well! The students can hit the killer, hurt him, and even work as a team to get the gun out of his hands! Tell me what you think they should do, and what the students should do."
"5198","I had a gun man on my campes and I was only 10 right now I am 12 the was the most scary 4 hours of me being in school and now I think that is a really good idea but don't make so scary just let all the kids ahead of time know what is going to happen and we all need the training. And my friend that has move lot her brother to a gun man so I think that kids and are the ages 11 to 18 19 needs to have that kind of training and all teacher need that kind of training as well because then you will probably be way safer."
"5199","Everyone knows that teacher hates her kids"
"5200","Just wait till the nigga come in and stab his ass wit a pencil or small him wit a stapler"
"5201","We ah r licks on oour doors"
"5202","fucking bs. to fight the gun you use guns. they should teach young adults and even teachers how to use guns. Notice how in the 1800s there went mass shootings at bars and schools? because everyone had guns and the shooter knew that if he were to even pull out his shotgun that he would only be able to take down 1 or 2 kids. the government know this and they manipulate us without us knowing because they are power hungry. I bet half the people reading this have no fucking clue that 3/4ths of what the government and Obama are doing is illegal. sadly, Hilary is probably going to win the election and flip the US into a north Korea clone where the government always knows where you are and what you are doing. like america used to be so great but if trump doesn't win the election then its gonna be hell with mass shootings happening every week. we need to bring back the 2nd amendment soon or else."
"5203","I be running out side"
"5204","5:53 this time the guy is going  to fight back a little.Bull sh!t simulation."
"5205","If there was a REAL shooting I would take a chair and break the window and run out!!!! Glad school is out only have 1 drill every 2 years it's stupid"
"5206","The shooter comes in and see the football team and is just like I'm Fucked."
"5207","What if he started pre firing corners with an m60 on nuke town?"
"5208","if yung metro dont trust ya imma shoot"
"5209","But the thing is what would you do if the killer had a bomb and blows up the school or before when entering the classroom just toss a bomb in without getting hit? But seriously their are things you need to think about I need answers so it can help all of us in the future"
"5210","So that teacher wants us to stop rehearsing for an active shooter. Must be a mindless liberal."
"5211","It's kinda sad and depressing that schools have to be so worried about school shootings that they have to train for this."
"5212","They did something like this at my school, only we knew it was coming. It was pretty fun until the police almost made everyone lose their hearing by shooting a full mag through an M16A1 on full auto mode(Blank rounds but it was still loud). That and the fake blood ruined clothing lol"
"5213","She a good teacher."
"5214","How would they be in greater danger of no one tries? I truly stand by trying and fight back when the opportunity comes. If you know you have the advantage then take that strike. 

For teachers to say these type of drills are scaring the student and shouldn't be used, better be the teachers who attend the funeral of the many staff and students who cried in a corner while a gun mad came. If you can protect yourself and many other people, it is worth it."
"5215","this is not helping god damm"
"5216","We Don't Do These In England I Wish We Did... NOT THE REAL ONE FOR GODS SAKE"
"5217","I want the police to do what they have to in order to protect our kids !!! if firearms are part of the training so be it !!!! god bless our law enforcement officers who will rush into hell to protect our kids !!! they are our top priority"
"5218","That's what happen when a country allows it's citizens to purchas firearms"
"5219","In high school we had to practice the mandatory ""hide in a corner"" response. Right after, my teacher say us down, told us how stupid that plan was, and told us that if there was someone shooting, that we would pile all the furniture in front of the door, break the window, and climb down from the second story. The people waiting to climb out would have staplers, scissors, books, etc. ready to throw."
"5220","school drills are meaning well, but it's stupid. THE shooter most likely went to school and practiced the drills so they now that 90/100 of the classes are in the classroom"
"5221","Hi"
"5222","In my opinion, you have to fight or run. 99% of the time a student Is the shooter, so obviously they would know the drills. You think they're gonna walk past a room with the lights off and no one to be seen and say, ""I guess this class Is empty."" Nope, they're gonna know they're hiding In the corner because that's what they're taught to do."
"5223","holy crap go teachers"
"5224","tbh kids should not be calling their parents in a drill! cause if the police comes and tries to look for the shooter and all of a sudden there comes a bunch of adults the police might not know who the real shooter is. and cell phones block the communications between police officers."
"5225","I wonder how well she could do it if she were to also be striking, pinching, biting etc."
"5226","I wonder how well she would do if he was striking, pinching, biting etc."
"5227","I wonder how well she would do if he was striking, pinching, biting etc."
"5228","(Got shot)
(Raped)"

"5243","Because going under your desk is standard procedure all around the world for lockdowns"
"5244","+MrMeineNamen Usually school shooters tend favor being up close with their targets. If you know where the school shooter is and he's far enough away, you might be able to leg it out of the school with some luck.

The reason for barricading yourself in, isn't to become a sitting duck. It's to make it take way longer for the school shooter to get into your classroom. The reason for this, is so that the police got more time to arrive.

The school I went to when I had the school shooting drill was quite big as well, but it mostly consisted for long straight hallways, which the gunman would be able to hit you at.


Well, it's very true that it depends on the school. I once went to a school that was only consisting of one floor, therefore we'd probably just get out the fire exit (which was in all classes) and then run away."
"5245","+Mikkel Ljungberg No but you have a better chance of being missed as a moving target than sitting on the firing wall like a sitting duck. Plus when you go to a school as big as mine, there was plenty of ways to avoid one or two gunmen on your way out"

"5264","I know exactly what you are talking about :) and it's obvious! The government is money and power thirsty. They don't care about the people. And not to mention that OUR government planned the 9/11 event just so people could run up to them for help, just for the sake of money. They gave Isis the guns and all, and it doesn't matter which president we pick, are country has rotted, and there's nothing that we can do about it. Oh and people, people...

"5284","Dude in the first shots that was my school!!!"
"5285","If that teacher really attacked the gunman and he fought back, like in that practice scenario, the gunman would just shoot more, causing probably the teacher and more kids to get shot, and aggravate the gunman."

Shooters are not retarded... oh look, its Wednesday, full parking lot, BUT NO KIDS! Okay I guess Ill just go home! Like shit they know we are sitting in the corner, why make it easy for them to shoot us all efficiently.

"5346","And one of the best things to remember. if your staring down a shooter who is probably highly insane and psychotic, its always better to ACT instead of sit there and get shot. Atleast give the small chance of trying instead of not doing anything and whimpering in fear, because you either get shot sitting there or you miraculously stop him by trying to dis-arm him"

"5361","big mistake they're trying to teach smaller individuals to take down larger individuals. first thing to get a death grip on the gun and then strike for weak points Eyes, nose, balls, toes don't just fight with your hands use your teeth. the guys doing the training are a bunch of amateurs."

Mainly because the room we were in, there was another room for supplies and such. And the girls including me were fit in there and some of the guys had to just be outside, but on the floor. 
And they just kept saying how if someone came in they would take them down. 

However. I am a little relieved that we don't really do an active drill with some guy coming in.

"5455","What, our children aren't paranoid enough with all the crap they see on TV and their computers? I remember when we went to school to learn the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. Notice I said writing, that's where you pick up a pencil or pen and on paper, write in cursive whatever the teacher requested of you. Your penmanship and spelling were graded for correctness. Your Math class was delt with in the same way, no calculators, figured on paper called work sheets and that as well as your lesson turned in together so the teacher could see how you arrived at your answers. We read books not tablets, we studied basic science. We walked to school and we carried our books and homework in our arms and not in backpacks with everything in them but. We had a dress code of clean clothes, girls in skirts and blouse or dress, boys in pants of any material except biuejeans and bib coveralls, shorts were not allowed by either gender. Shoes, for both girls and boys, sneakers were changed into at gym time. All this was done in grade school and when the bell rang at the days end we walked or ran home and changed into our play clothes, then after supper it was homework and a little play time or maybe an hour of TV before bed. Today and once in a blue moon, some nitwit that didn't have the disaplin and respect taught them when needed, crawls out of his computer game system and puts it into reality and we think a shooting drill is needed throughout the country? I'm retired now and rent, and you better believe I'm awfully damn glad I'm not watching my school taxes being flushed down the drain anymore. Did you know that only a small percentage of today's grade schoolers can write their name legibly or name the nearest planet to the sun or our earth. Ask them to go outside on a sunny day in the morning and point, North, East, South or West. Better yet you write a small, fifty to a hundred word note in cursive and ask your fifth grader or any fifth grader to read it back. Now take this up at your next P.T.A. meeting."
"5456","I have a solution for ya.Don't be a fucking idiot and bully someone without being ready to face the consequences.Quite fucking simple.And to be exact watch out for the insecure and disturbed white kids that everyone picks on.....you would be asking for a death wish"
"5457","XAVIER GOES TO MY SCHOOL!!!"
"5458","We call them ""intruder"" drills. Not ""school shooting"" drills."
"5459","This should be mandatory in all schools. You don't have to act but it should be any individuals choice."
"5460","Let's be honest a shooter won't hold his gun out like that so you can grab his arm hell no when u lunge at him he'll step back and blast your brains out"
"5461","how does killing students/teachers benefit school shooters??"
"5462","I dont think I would want these drills at my school but I would because when we do drills the popular girls will talk and think its not serious"
"5463","Go teacher Holly!"
"5464","There was a bomb threat at my school once and we had to evacuate the school & surrounding homes (including my house) so I was forced to stay at the crusty ass church for 6 hours after school was supposed to let out"
"5465","we hide in the bathroom"
"5466","When the last time I heard of a bank robbery, purse snatching , or a stabbing on the news ? Evert time I looked at the news there's a massacre smh criminals lost it"
"5467","how are you kinda scared that a guy is shooting in your school"
"5468","'It's just a drill bro!'"
"5469","TBH if school shooters were actually smart they would pull the fire alarm so everyone would conveniently be out of the building"
"5470","We had this in my old school I was petrified 😵"
"5471","Ya merica!!!!"
"5472","I laughed my ass off at 3:50... That shit was to funny."
"5473","I was in 2 real lockdowns at boulder creek"
"5474","If you have unannounced lockdown drills it could become the boy who cries wolf problem and when it's real they might not go into hiding"
"5475","I like that they are training the teachers to fight back"
"5476","I don't know how efficient this is since the shooters can break in easy, group of the shooter's friends helping out, and how it stimulate an actual real shoot out...but okay?"
"5477","we ha one today because of  shooting at a mall but everyoneat the school was fine"
"5478","Lol look at the left 0:51"
"5479","If god was real, these drills wouldn't even have to be a thing."
"5480","Same thing happened at my school but without the guns"
"5481","Why not hire male teachers that know how to fight and possibly know how guns work instead of wasting time on women( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"5482","1:24

DAMN MAN THIS AIN'T GTA LOL"
"5483","Lmao hell the fuck no fuck a corner im dipping its a big school he aint going to be by my class so soon"
"5484","*shooter walks in*
""Oh hey guys""
*easily shoots the kids hiding behind the desk//corner*
~
(am i the only one who thinks that whenever there is a lockdown drill the, we hide in the most obvious spot ever - behind the teahcer's desk??)"
"5485","Looks fun😂"
"5486","One time we had a drill and what happened was there was a police officer running around in a sweatshirt and mask, holding a realistic airsoft gun. Students were told to wear packs of red liquids under their clothes and the officer would aim for the arms legs and chest, but not the head. Im in a electric wheelchair. My friends and i were alone in the bathroom cleaning up from lunch. Just me and two of my friends. And we hear shots and screams. Whenever i moved my wheelchair  it would make a loud noise, so my friends took of their jackets and sweatshirts to muffle the wheels. We literally were running around the school grabbing notebooks and then we went into the room where the officer kept his spare gun, we knew where he put it because my friends looked inside from the outside windows. We grabbed his gun and a few plastic airsoft knives. So you would see a girl in a wheelchair holding a gun and two girls holding knives running around a school. I got shot in the leg and all i felt was somthing cold underneath my sock. I shot the guy in the chest, so proud of myself. We even got an award to bravery and smart thinking!!!  :D"
"5487","They all hide in the same place in a corner"
"5488","GOOD JOB"
"5489","even if I knew it was a drill I definitely wouldn't be all huddled up I would be hideing next to the door so when he comes in I fight that man hopefully the others would help I would especially do this just to be funny and because I could get away with it if I knew it was a drill"
"5490","classmates that beat up gunmans together graduate together"
"5491","great idea bunch everyone together at least give the teacher some chance fucking at least pepper spray fucking liberals fucking obama and the other democrat in the past 20 years that closed mental hospital"
"5492","This makes no since it's Monday I know I saw kids got in there school if I'm coming to kill the kids. I been to school I know what the drill is and what your suppose to do I'm not stupid"
"5493","They should have notified everyone first and done it right."
"5494","wasting students time with this drill shit. all teachers should be armed, problem solved!"
"5495","These ""School Shooting Drills"" are just another tool used to conform our youth to accept bullying by police as acceptable behavior, a way of life. Armed police suited up in riot gear, busting in our schools, shooting up the place (hey, chill out- they're just blanks) , and scaring the shit out of kids....nope, nothing wrong with that. After all, they are the POLICE, right? And it's for ""our own protection"". Guns in OUR hands isn't what we should be fearing, fear those who carry a badge to use them on US with no repercussions. Funny, I don't recall EVER asking our government to ""protect"" me from ANYTHING? When did it become our government's ""duty""  to ""protect"" us from the dangers of life? Silly me, I thought they were supposed to protect us from big corporations,  to ""secure"" our gold,  and...oh, I don't know....maybe our BORN RIGHTS. Notice I didn't say ""constitutional"" rights, or ""God given"" rights? I have rights because I ""AM"". I live and I have the right to PROTECT myself, regardless if I did something stupid like shoplift a candy bar, or drank as a minor, or even busted a headlight on my cheating boyfriends piece of shit car- not saying I DID any of these things, just an example. These are OUR children, they are OUR responsibility. It's OUR job to PROTECT them, NOT the government's. They have NO RIGHT to FORCE any of they're ""belief's"" on our children. DO NOT LET THEM. LESS government, MORE liberty. VIVA LA REVOLUTION!!!"
"5496","it happed in my school I got shot in the leg"
"5497","okay, but that first drill looks terrifying. as a person with bad anxiety when i know i can't leave a place, i know i personally would feel like throwing up. i understand it's supposed to test reflexes and all that, but this sounds like a nightmare for kids with anxiety."
"5498","It's sad that this has to happen because of stupid people who think it's okay to terrorise children"
"5499","If it was a real shooter the dude would had just fucking bashed her skull than shot her point blank. This is literally retarded. I don't know any other word to use."
"5500","this was haliraous"
"5501","lol the teachers fighting back made me laugh abit because it just look like she would of been killed after that little fight back she gave"
"5502","So airplanes have secret Air Marshals  why can't schools have the same but pretending to be a teacher?"
"5503","What in the hell are tennis balls gonna do"
"5504","How they think to protect thereselfs from shooters throw balls at them"
"5505","if there was a lock down and the meany comes to the class and finds us i would push desks to him and shout call 911 and get his gun and yah..."
"5506","In  real life she would have gotten the gun faster because she could have bitten him if it was real"
"5507","DAMN SHE WENT RONDA ROUSY ON HIS ASS"
"5508","3:52 hahahahah OMG xd"
"5509","you know this is stuped the way the school does this. the Maine goal of the shooter is to kill people if you put the kids behind a desk you are lining them up as targets one right after the other. schools are also big targets for them criminals because they know the school has no way to protect them slefs they rely on the cops and the cops take time to get their and then they have to make a plan. see where I'm coming from"
"5510","lol in elementary school we had a lock down, but my friends and I couldn't stop making noises and giggling, my teacher kept telling us to shut it haha"
"5511","Its just a drill bro"
"5512","I use to go to school there for only 3 months"
"5513","This is what Americas gun regulations have come to sigh!"
"5514","Wtf are they doing getting in a corner so that the shooter can get a quad feed??😩"
"5515","they shouldn't be showing this... now the shooter knows where to go."
"5516","In my school they told us unless the shooter is on the other side of the school we can leave and run. Other wise we stay in the class and barricade the door, or jump out the window."
"5517","I actually had a bomb in my high school gchs!"
"5518","At my school we have drills where we have double locks on our doors. Then we go over what we would do. Like if they got in we would have to throw things at them and escape"
"5519","I think that this is brilliant, this should happen everywhere at every school, it isnt exageration its hoping for the best and preparing for the worst"
"5520","Ask the teachers and kids at Sandy Hook.  They were involved in a drill that our criminal politicians and their allies in media have presented as the real thing."
"5521","your shit car can do 130 on non highways??"
"5522","some of those teachers got nice bootys"
"5523","I have lockdown drills about once a month and mine go on for like 15-30 minutes"
"5524","Just last year in my school a so called drill me and my frinds relised that it wasn't after 2 or more houres in luock down may I add we were in 8th gread"
"5525","Carry a concealed firearm"
"5526","can you bite?"
"5527","*window"
"5528","how we do it is we closed the window sliders and door sliders and sit along the wall, he teacher sits under the teach"
"5529","Hey I go there😂"
"5530","Listen it could be dangerous but kids need to know how to defend themselves. It could be dangerous and they are risking there lives but they are doing it to save other peoples lives even if it means sacrificing there life."
"5531","Damn that nigga went 130"
"5532","Yes, lets not tell the parents and ruin the kids life when their family members die speeding to save them."
"5533","W.T.F. they didn't tell them they were doing the drill. Talk about inciting mass panic."
"5534","The part where the teacher and man fight is very cringe-worthy"
"5535","Assassination Classroom???"
"5536","It was just a prank bro"
"5537","Yes sir americans you did it again."
"5538","Columbine shooting was terrifying! I was in high school at the time"
"5539","fuck that shit im runnin"
"5540","Remember That riot that police couldn't take down because they only used dogs?"
"5541","That's also why you Brits have a skyrocketing violent crime rate and places where police won't even go because the gangs are armed to the teeth and have military grade weapons unlike your officers. Now shut that twat you call a mouth and read some statistics before making yourself look like a bafoon again."
"5542","Like I said, Americans like guns."
"5543","because weapon don't help. why don't just make it harder for the killer to get a weapon? like in the most other countries. where not as many people die because of that shit"
"5544","+Philip Byrne Americans like guns, but not THAT much."
"5545","Idiot. It's to help students and teachers prepare for a shooting."
"5546","+Lucy Cookie missing the point i see.I'm not making excuses,i just have a certain opinion about this subject.If you're going to fuck around with other kids like that you should keep in mind that everyone reacts differently and that there will be some people that won't put up with your bullshit.It seems you have some rules on how someone should fight back when someone's bullying them.....how stupid can you get?The only way this could be probably stopped is if bullying is completely wiped off but we all know that is impossible so i guess kids in American schools are going to have to look out and be on their guard from all the bullied kids in their schools instead of actually not bullying them."
"5547","Being bullied isn't an excuse to shoot up a school. Now you're defending shooters who took innocent peoples lives."
"5548","+TrailBehindTheRest how did you know?"
"5549","+Darkzz Lord you have issues"
"5550","Training wont help when a few ex-marines go into the school with assault rifles"
"5551","+HoodNation Plays training for any situation always helps"
"5552","Dude, this training really wont help them much"
"5553","+AidenCS Kid."
"5554","+Tracer Cruz true I have moved to fps gaming for like a year but moved back since I just love Nintendo"
"5555","+AidenCS We all have our opinions, and I respect your love of Nintendo, because the NES was my first ever game console, but I have moved on to FPS gaming. Good luck with those games."
"5556","+Tracer Cruz I've played those and of those happy wheels is the best.U see tho Nintendo always gives a heartwarming and nostalgic experience that no other video game can master. Games like Mario Galaxy, ocarina of time, Mario kart, Pokemon and the super paper Mario series r all better than what u listed"
"5557","+Meowzerz145 If it's unintended and wasn't told there would be a drill you are kinda scared because you don't know if it's a drill or not. So.. You stupid. Of course you'll be kind of scared."
"5558","+Marina Cocola lol what if whenever the teacher can smell the smoke all the ways for you to exit is covered in flames?"
"5559","I think we found a school shooter"
"5560","yeah so all the kids are in the open"
"5561","thats kind of a bad idea because of grenades and molotovs"
"5562","""THROW THE MIGHTY TENNIS BALLS!!"""
"5563","+Ethan Pearson I don't wanna believe in god, ok. If you want to then I respect that, it's your opinion. I don't believe in god and that's just my opinion"
"5564","when there's a god, there's a devil"
"5565","""realistic airsoft gun"" and ""heard screams and shots"" Yeah well guess you can figure that one out"
"5566","Did you go to meme school?"
"5567","Sara I feel the same way. Hopefully schools would announce that it's a drill. So that way parents and students aren't freaking out."
"5568","I quit crossfit to join #VapeNation"
"5569","+Brendon Urie if it was a real fight he would have just punched her in the head and shot the redneck crazy idiot in the face"
"5570","+Fabio Matu man oh man! If I saw a tennis ball thrown I would immediately switch gender to a golden retriever and run after that because you know, I'm a golden retriever and not a human that would get distracted so easily from the task at hand"
"5571","Distraction"
"5572","Well maybe the tennis balls will help grow a pair so he doesnt attack school kids lol"
"5573","Oh never mind colorful balls"
"5574","No everyone should grab a desk or chair and beat him up

Like someone by the door with a desk and when they come in WHACK in the head and we live well maybe"
"5575","+DankGrandpa How triggered are you by his b8 m8?"
"5576","How old are you? You probably wouldn't survive a second in a active shooter scenario"
"5577","+FadeXG idk..lol"
"5578","+Walter White Yea gun control worked so well in Chicago...oh wait a minute."
"5579","I don't get how they expect that to save the kids. At my school all we do is just go in the corner, so if it was real we would obviously be found. It's just bullshit."
"5580","armament training as a matter of compulsory eduction. 2nd ammendment validation too. y not on ballot?  has been proposed before.  y not people screamig about that?  agenda for not training american children for armaments?  why?  no libtards need speak. armaments and weapons and war are absoluteof life. responsible society prepares and trains its people, doen't shelter them, helps them to cope."
"5581","Lmfao i know you did there. and yea"
"5582","+Erik Pyatetskiy Don't you mean stallion?"
"5583","+Crazy Horse Thank you brother"
"5584","Good speech, buddy!"
"5585","+Adnaan Mastan That's pretty fucked up but I'd do the same lol"
"5586","+Oliver O'Keafe if the shooter comes in the classroom and everyones dying so im taking the chance and taking an exit"
"5587","what will you learn? that your actions have consequences?"
"5588","my cousin goes to sky view"
"5589","I live in colrado in falcon"
"5590","Why the fuck are they all hiding along the back of a room instead of getting ready to kick the shit out of them?"
"5591","Ya see.. there is one problem with Posting this online.. IT'S ONLINE ANYONE CAN SEE IT! Now they know what to look for, thanks ABC News!"
"5592","Maybe put a gun in each classroom with a lock that the teacher has."
"5593","the teachers schould have tazers or something"
"5594","the teachers schould have tazers or something"
"5595","this is better than waiting in a corner and if they come in just being shot to death"
"5596","at my high school we all get under our desks (not the girls don't want their pants dirty) and just talk and hang out with are hones (some teachers don't care if we are lol)"
"5597","I'd hit that ass"
"5598","Our high school only does one lockdown and two fire drills a year. Also in my school, we always know when something will happen since firefighters are walking around for five minutes or so when we have our fire drill, and when we have a lockdown there are usually patrol cars outside and police in the main office and atrium."
"5599","She was going at his ass damnnnn"
"5600","Why can't it be like wwe use the freaking chairs"
"5601","Fuck that I'm not gonna sit in the corner of the room waiting to be massacred just jump out the window and gas it out of the school"
"5602","Do they not have locks on the doors?"
"5603","teacher: you put your toy gun down and get away from my students lol"
"5604","While I was watching this a huge rubber band broke and scared the shit out of me"
"5605","I know This is inappropriate  but they should leave a extra gun for defense"
"5606","There all happy and cheering when learning to take down a shooter, and it's good to learn, but if they meet a real shooter everything changes, they might even have panic attack, I can almost guarantee that if they meet a real shooter it won't be that easy to take him down, and the teachers won't be laughing or cheering then"
"5607","stupid to be pissed at this, this is a great idea. It's sad that we live in a world that needs this kind of training but it's better to have the training then not. The teacher training is even better too."
"5608","Give the teachers a fucking shotgun under their desk, locked and secured. And stand in the doorway waiting to blast any beta bitch who tries to kill people with their daddies 9mm."
"5609","I can imagine my teacher (litteraly like 250 lbs) waiting at the door for a shooter to barge In and then the kids running around a so it would be harder for him to shoot more people and we all have our objected that were gonna throw at them 😂 that's how my class would react and the guy probobaly will end up with a few broke limbs . Just remember we could prevent this from happening if people aren't buying guns and selling them on the street to non-licensed people"
"5610","lmao why wouldn;t they tell them it's going to be a school shooting drill? The entire point of a drill is to instill a method of reaction when something happens. If you DON'T know what kind of drill it is, then how are you going to know how to react? I also think it's rather fitting to leave an impression of terrorist cops in kid's minds ^^

Damn, that guy was supposed to be 'fighting' back, but he can't really do that because resisting someone in such a situation basically requires you to injure them. A couple punches from him to her face would've worked wonders to get her off of him. It does kinda provide a false sense of security.

Also, a bunch of these drills could kind of desensitive kids to a school shooting and not react to one thinking it's a drill. smh."
"5611","They should have a gunman come in and tell nobody and see if the teachers would actually we able to use this, because you can train for years but if you bomb the test, did you really learn anything?"
"5612","hide in the corner......NIGGA FUCK THAT SHIT, MY ASS IS RUNNING. IF I HERE BANG BANG, IM RUNNING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. FUCK THAT BULLET PROOF BLANKET TOO, NIGGA WOULD PULL THAT SHIT OFF LIKE A STICK, BOY WILL BE LIKE "" HAHA, YOUR SAFE, BANG BANG"" FUCK COUNTING THE PEOPLE, IM SAVING MY FUCKING LIFE"
"5613","on one story buildings couldn't they lock the doors and open the windows to get out? please explain. I know the shooter could go outside but still"
"5614","I'm glad ABC news still does cool stories like this!"
"5615","yes, lets possibly give the students PTSD like, wtf."
"5616","Fine ass teachers"
"5617","In all my years of being a student, I have never once had one of these."
"5618","I don't think that this is wrong because a shooter won't come in and shoot with a staple gun or plastic one."
"5619","My school lockdown is we all just duck our heads lol"
"5620","I'm a student and I feel like this training should be mandatory to teachers and if students want to learn along with the teachers they have the right to but don't have to"
"5621","When I look at those kids I think I'm gonna to die of noise"
"5622","I can see 100 pairs of pants flying everywhere XD"
"5623","14 kids it to take down my dad"
"5624","Ok, are you actually kidding? They're taught to disarm them by having the gunman's arm under the teacher's neck. Gun? No problem. Breathing? Yeah... About that."
"5625","this is why I have a gun in my room in collage"
"5626","Just make a badass tunnel system where they can hide in a small hidden room xD"
"5627","These are necessary now because so many people are loose cannons but I think there needs to be tasers for teachers"
"5628","0:51 Me tryna get my friends attention in class."
"5629","Fuck the rules I ain't going in a fucking corner with other kids. I will break the damn window with a chair if i have to."
"5630","is that a cap gun"
"5631","Why are the kids stuck in a corner of the room, and why aren't the teachers armed?"
"5632","This is disgusting, Instead of having drills America should pull up and change the gun laws  please tell me when the last school shooting was in Australia and compare that to America with the gun laws"
"5633","yes,do these exercise most probably some possible maniacs that want to do a school massacre have see this video and know what to do now for don't be suppressed,you idiots"
"5634","BUT WHEN THE TEACHERS IS DENFIEING THE KIDS THE TEACHER CAN GET STOT OR KILL!"
"5635","0:51 the real MVP"
"5636","My school ain't gotta worry about this"
"5637","My teacher was on this ;-;"
"5638","the kid waving her or his hand at 00:48"
"5639","You don't all go to one corner you smash the Windows if there inside and you run your basically a sitting duck"
"5640","These drills are beyond stupid. Yes I get the point that you turn off the lights and lock the door, also hide behind a wall... But I would assume every shooter/burglar knows there's people in classrooms like that. So my question is, WHY DONT THE KIDS AND TEACHERS GRAB A BLUNT OR HARD OBJECT AND WAIT BEHIND THE WALL INCASE IF THE SHOOTER COMES IN THAT SPECIFIC ROOM! I mean what... the kids are suppose to bunch up into a ball and freak out and get shot if thats the case? I don't see why the teacher at least grabs something."
"5641","all we have in my school, is a freaking fire drill. NOTHING else. Teachers don't care."
"5642","my inner white boy is panicking. Shooting up school is gonna be so much harder now. btw NSA im joking dont stalk me."
"5643","if these practice drills always happen and kids get too familiar with them, when a real shooting happens, the kids might not take it seriously as they might think it is just a practice loll"
"5644","At my highschool, We keep one case of base balls in every desk incase of this. Its very strange but smart haha"
"5645","Lol I love farting in these drills"
"5646","They're was a man walking outside on the streets with a gun close to the schools . We had lock down and I was freaking out kids were calling parents etc . But the other half thought it was a joke or a drill and were standing up in front of windows and being loud . If that man would've came on campus we would've been screwed ... They need to scare the SHIZ out of my school"
"5647","How will hiding under a desk help? we have doors positioned were you can hide against the wall and they can't see you."
"5648","Bruh we had a lock down at our school and one teacher CALMLY tell the kids to go behind the table and only locked the door and cover the window. But MY teacher and OUR way of lock down is cover the door with tables, desks, a huge cabinet, and we grab something to throw. We were there for an hour and thirty min."
"5649","well done now the future shooters know what to avoid when shooting."
"5650","Wait he was doing 130mps and he almost got a ticket?"
"5651","we had an intruder drill today"
"5652","I am so glad I am from germany. The most hostile thing here is cafeteria food and honestly even that aint bad. German engeneering bois. 
   Rot Schwarz Gold Bois"
"5653","Although this is very controversial, the best way to get kids ready for this sort of thing is ""experience"" but there should be guidelines,  The way I see lock down drills, The way I see lock down drills for shooters is how I saw those the cold war, ""Duck and cover"" videos, it's false hope to save you life from a Nuclear bomb, or from a shooter."
"5654","Why don't they teach the teachers to properly shoot and defend with, I don't know, FUCKING GUN?!"
"5655","Colorado?
well shit"
"5656","If they keep doing these fake drills the kids won't believe them if a real shooter attacks."
"5657","Does anyone else wish that their school did a drill like this ?"
"5658","That's why I take my glock to school."
"5659","It's just a prank bro"
"5660","what if a kid hid in a locker"
"5661","sad"
"5662","We once had one go for 2 hours since Admin wanted it so seem real"
"5663","Who noticed at 3:23 and 2:24 someone in the back of the class was eating food?"
"5664","We actually thought we were going to die
I was kinda scared"
"5665","I live in the town next to sandy hook and we were in lockdown for 4 HOURS and if we didn't bring lunch to school, police had to escort us down through the back of the cafeteria to get lunch because out cafeteria was full of Windows. It was very scary but they wouldn't tell us what was going on so I went through the day in confusion. Another time a man stabbed himself near our schools and was running with the knife so we were in lockdown for 2 hours. I've already experienced the real thing"
"5666","What if the shooter had a grenade and a gun. Don't prepare you for that."
"5667","When I was in 5th some middle schooler called in a bomb threat to the middle school and we all had to stay in school until 6:00 because we share buses and they had to move the middle school and the Highschool to the elementary school, we then had a week of no school it turns out they caught the middle schooler and he only did it because he didn't want to take the standardized test. The middle school is right next to the elementary school so I didn't understand why they had to move everyone to them elementary school, the Highschool is much bigger and Is a lot farther"
"5668","'A Desk or even a Dictionary'


A Dictionary in the head would make the gunman hug the floor..."
"5669","That video proves, that there is no more stupid nation in the world than americans. 

Why change laws about gun control? For what? You can't do that for so many years, right? Because what? Your freedom? Pride? Tradition? 

For that reason you live in times, when you have to teach your children what to do, when maniac will arrives in their school and that will happend. You know that for sure."
"5670","Better to have them frightened for one day than to be totally unprepared in case the REAL THING should happen. This was just a drill and they all will live, but they might not if they are not prepared."
"5671","They should put a few furnitures in front of the door"
"5672","wot dah fuck. Covering students in blood and shit is WAY too far. It is absolutely fine to let the kids know what procedures need to take place in the event of a school shooting, however what purpose does covering kids in fake blood hold? They now know where to hide better? fuck no what is the point in that bullshit all you're doing is traumatizing young kids in preperation for an event that will most likely not happen during their schooling years. some bullshit right there."

"5685","Active shooter drills, and lockdown drills in general, are almost identical to the old civil defense ""duck-and-cover"" drills in the '50s and '60s. Hiding under a school desk may protect you from a firework, but not from a thermonuclear detonation. Same idea with lockdown drills. Sure, locking the door, closing the blinds, turning off the lights and getting in the corner may protect you from a machete-wielding schizophrenic who forgot to take their meds, but won't stop a psychologically damaged 13-year-old who plans on getting revenge on his bullies with his dad's assault rifle. 

It's the same effect. Everyone likes to think that their kids are safe from a crazed gunman. But deep down, the parents all know that the gunman will just kick the door open and open fire."

"5687","""These drills might be terrifying"" well I don't expect him to give out candy my school teaches us the same drills except we get shot at with air soft guns as you can't tell the difference and we learn different types of defence styles in pe and the funny thing is there has never been a mass school

 That's why teacher's are back round checked before being able to work around youths. Anyone could shoot anyone but the chance of a teaching shooting students is much much lower than another student attacking his/hers peers."
"5696","Good thinking but what if the teacher is the shooter?"
"5697","well think of it this way if you were to take away someone's guns are are taking them from a person that is good and does not have a felony charge. but that's not going to change for the bad people their still going to buy them and we good people are not going to have a way to protect our selfs"

"5738","My school doesn't do these drills because they think nothing could happen. We had one. In a whole school year and no one took it seriously. That was actually also a day that the high school I would've gone to had a gun threat and could've been shot down and then there are the kids at my school not taking this seriously"
"5739","0:51 in the top left corner 😂😂😂"
"5740","Why do they just grapple when being in a controlled position? You have fists for a reason you know..."
"5741","The defense those teachers are being taught is kinda dumb. When they attack the gun man, their gun goes behind the teachers back and the gun man could just shoot them in the back. Besides that, I have no problem with the there drills. In fact if I could play a student that got shot and have to fly backwards, I might find it fun. But during real shootings those children need to know what to do"
"5742","That shooter should have been prepared if he has any actual training and his weapon and arm are compromised expect a combat knife coming at you from the left."

It was in the cafeteria and everybody just ran. 1 special needs kid got shot and then a heroic guidance counselor tackled the shooter, thank God there were no deaths! The boy that was shot was in critical condition however survived!"
"5747","We had a real lockdown because of a bulletshell and it took 3-5 hours. We had a sub in Spanish and the closest real teacher was a room away and she was a teacher in training. One kid in our class was late and she couldn't get into the building. And then our actual teacher couldn't get in because. There were also k9s as well. FREAKY"
"5748","I HATE THIS NEWS GUY!!!! He is discouraging the heroism of students and faculty!"
"5749","I don't think that we should bring guns into schools for protection (that's what got us in this situation to begin with) but something that would be great is giving this kind of self defense class to every student. So that way they aren't totally helpless."
"5750","I remember when my school had a lockdown drill and there was this kid in my class who was just all like '' were all going to die in here!'' and ''I'm not letting any of u guys talk to me unless its Mr.Jim'' and I felt so bad for him"
"5751","Unaware that it was just a prank bro"
"5752","I think these drills need to be done in all schools now .-. special with all this terrorist stuff happening"

"5754","The doors need locks.. In my school (i live in Finland) Every door has a lock."
"5755","only in america"
"5756","i say i dnt relly care and i am even in 7th still so ya its better for them to do it like that beuase it is more rilistic"
"5757","My school does a similar thing. When a shooter enters the building, the principle announces where he (or she) is entering from then locks himself in his office. If you are in a room that is not close to where they enter, you evacuate the school and get as far away as possible. All classrooms lock doors, or move to classrooms that do have doors, lock them, then tie a rope around a handle and have the strongest kids hold it shut. If there is no door on the classroom, we stack chairs up on the entrance, then move to another section of the school, since most rooms are interconnected. Since the shooter is going to try to kill as many people as possible before the police arrive, if it takes too long he will move to another door. If he gets in, we throw everything we have at him, tackle him, and move his gun away from him if he drops it. God damn that was a lot to type, and I'm impressed if you've made it this far."
"5758","Imagine someone pulls a knife on the guy"
"5759","I would beat the heck out of the bad guy with any weapon. If he doesn't see me"
"5760","This will get so many people killed. Some of the teachers had the gunman's arm right around their neck (He can strangle them and save ammo.) and when they tried that rush at the end... If you're entering a room and are surprised by someone why would you enter that room? You'd just try to back out because if they want to go after you, they'll have to go through the confined space of a door where you can shoot them down. Amateur overlyconfident dickless types of gunmen act like that."
"5761","Only a 5 minute drill???????????? My school does like 1 1/2 drills!"
"5762","I've never had fake blood or a fake shooter during lock down drills at any of the schools I've went to."
"5763","""Will a 100 pound student be able to take down a gunman?"" We'll.... Most teachers that were at my schools were about 140-200 XD"

"5767","K"
"5768","You douche bags gonna think, a corners gonna protect you, a gun will protect u, not a fucking corner"
"5769","The shooter isn't going to announce when he's going to intrude they got it right they just should've made police aware that they were doing it but other than they got it right"
"5770","The longest drill they had have is five minutes? I remember my school once did a drill that lasted over thirty minutes. 0_o"
"5771","Just get all the wrestlers to stand behind the doors to take his ass down."
"5772","Wouldn't a simple door lock be effective? You would think it would at Best Buy precious seconds for the police.... You think?"
"5773","I don't care what the teacher says I'm out the window"
"5774","""These drills may be too frighting"" just like if an actual shooter came in "
"5775","It's sad that schools need to do this. Guns are tools for ending lives. Why are they provided to the public? Do members of the public need to end lives? I think guns should only be used by the armed services. In the UK even the police don't carry guns because they don't need to."
"5776","I would cry and scream :/"
"5777","ah yes theres a window you could get the children outside to safety but yeah, lets jus chill behind the desk !!"
"5778","People complaining saying they were too scared blah blah blah.. But This is exactly what's needed sadly."
"5779","In Iowa there's A.L.I.C.E. It's where instead of hiding we find the nearest available exit and run. We also attack the shooter if they are near. We only hide if all exits are blocked."
"5780","at my school and most probably, if there's a school shooting and your in the bath room or getting a drink of water as soon as the shooting is called your stuck out in the hallway nowhere to go all doors locked no way out, I hate my school does this but it's for safety. if I was in  the hallway I'd hide in the bathroom stalls"
"5781","it is  not  Always  face.......... ok!"
"5782","I was a student at Jewett Academy (the school in the video) at the time when this drill happened , in fact I was in the same room as the girl who complained she was scared. And I can assure you she was just fine during the drill and she was snapchating her friends and texting all of them sending laughing faces, all signs that she was just fine. This drill was in fact very different from all of the other drills we have done in the past but I can assure you it was not bad at all, it was actually very smart it really tested how we students and teachers could handle this kind of pressure. I honestly feel like she was just trying to get attention. We NEED drills like these and we need to start preparing better and when we do try to prepare not complain about it being scary, because imagine if that was real imagine if these were real gunmen trying to kill us, what would she have done then? The parents need to treat them like big kids and help prepare them for real life."
"5783","my lock down drills go on about 30 min :/"
"5784","THAT IS NOT HOW YOU PRACTICE A DRILL!!! All those schools have it wrong. If the students hid, and kept things to throw or hit the invader with they have a much higher chance of surviving."
"5785","Japon : earthquake drill . USA : shooting drill"
"5786","If its a room full of students omg the shooter will lose (cheers thrown(held a gun point(laptop broken(broken leg)"
"5787","Heres the thing that they should also think of, if there is a shooting, its good to have knowledge about that, but if you teach them how to defend themselfs at least they know, because if there is a shooting, and if the shooter goes in a class, its either you all wait for your deaths or do something to save your life, and potentially stop the shooter. 
Lets say that the whole class is waiting at the door just in case, and the shooter goes in and everyone rushes on him, someone might get hurt but the way i see it, its better one kid injured then an entire class 6 feet under. its a good idea what they started to do, even if it might be a bit stressing. 
Im no a professional in self defense and all that stuff so there is a lot of room for improvements if someone decides to use this idea, but its still something serious that should be considered."
"5788","the fact that this is recommended for me scares me"
"5789","There is a new Law that might happen you can bring guns to school kids bring shotguns in"

"5795","once in my  school there where some guys who left a granade in the front entrance i was scared but luckily nothing happened"
"5796","wouldent playing dead make no sense at all because what  if there is only one shooter they dont remember shooting you"
"5797","ok but what if a shooter actually goes in during a drill"
"5798","Why is everyone clumped in together?! And if one 100-pound person can't wrestle down a 200-pound gunman, why couldn't you just bring in more people? (Like say the students)"
"5799","Fuck im in carol city high (miami-dade) and we have shootings all the time but do we have drills? Nope. Does anyone care? Nope. Have people gotten killed? Yep. Have I been scared to even go to school? Every-fucking-day. AND I'VE NEVER BEEN OFFERED 'TRAINING' It sucks, it really does because people tell me to just *'keep my head down and dont piss people off'* Thats our fucking *""training""*.
I'm not even mad at the all the shooters I'm mad at the fucking *school* for not doing anything about it. 

I am going to die in my own fucking school and it wont matter like all the other kids in my school who got shot all the damn time."
"5800","Have they ever thought to remove guns. Make guns less accessible."
"5801","Wait, wait, wait. You're practically telling the shooters where the students hide in an event of a school shooting by filming this.

There's a reason they don't show you footage of the President's Emergency exit strategy.
If i was a shooter, the blinds and a locked door would deter me, but now i know that the blinds down is most likely a classroom full of people, and blinds up are empty.

Just fucking pay me by the hour and shout me some beers and ill give you *LOGICAL* advice."

"5806","we don't do drills any more we just run out of the school all at 1"

"5884","In my school all we do is just be quiet and turn off all the lights and put our heads down.But still I think that a shooter will still see us inside because the windows are big and cause a lot of light in the inside!
Well properly because my school was built in the early 1960s or late 50s."
"5885","I am going to kill everybody in this mother f**k!
lol"
"5886","Sandy Hook was a False Flag yet people are stupid enough to believe otherwise haha."
"5887","Im going to be real right now, in September I was involved in a school shooting and I think these drills are scary but completely necessary. There is truly no way to fully prepare for something like that. I would continue treating them as if they were real."
"5888","These drills don't really prepare the kids for Droidekas"
"5889","Wow they filmed this in Colorado. I live in Colorado and I had a drill about 1 month ago....!!!!"
"5890","sad"
"5891","I want my school to teach us this..."
"5892","Did anyone see that kid dancing in :50 -:51"
"5893","ok den"
"5894","Regardless of the probability that a teacher would be able to disarm and take down a potential shooter wouldnt it still be a better option then clustering all of the people into a tight corner and waiting to get killed. It would make a lot more sense to teach them to barricade doorways and use the fact that they are surrounded by desks to their advantage. As far as parents complaining about the fear and emotional trauma instilled into their kids from realistic kids try thanking the police force when your kid doesnt die do to proper instruction"
"5895","Why don't they make the drills at my school at least realistic..."
"5896","I HAVE AN IDEA if its in lockdown..... PUT A POLICEMAN IN EACH CLASS ROOM"
"5897","Someone stand near the door with an scissors, pens, or something! And stab them when they walk through the door. And if I hear him smashing through the door, I am going smash that window and get the heck out of there."
"5898","I mean I'm In karaty"
"5899","I'm I'm kartay so I know what to do"
"5900","My school has a tornado drill every other month, a lock down drill every other week, fire drills every 3 months and we actually never do them for the same amount of time. Also when the shooter was fighting back, it kinda looked like she was twerking for a second."
"5901","What about the ""No guns on campus"" sign? Jesus."
"5902","Lol imagine the teacher asks the rugby/football team to tackle the shooter and then one of the players kung fu kicks the shooter"
"5903","australian=0 shootings america = 1 a month shooting"
"5904","in middle school, we spread out around the room and we are grabbing chairs and other things just in case we need to throw them..."
"5905","aim a gril end were i live ther are a lott of shoting.If i were in tath situación ideal would of ben so scard i would ckic him on the balls.~."
"5906","Easy way to avoid stuff like this and other bad stuff in general is for society to stop ignoring people, judging people and using people as objects. Its sad for stuff like this but when u look at the most awful crimes society also played a role in them."
"5907","what if your teacher is way to old to do the training"
"5908","These drills are just sad who the fuck is that retarted to not to know there are kids there there are cars outside there are lights on"
"5909","If you put this on T.V. and the internet, it shows their practices and how to bypass them. If I felt like it, I could walk in and all the training would be wasted."
"5910","I don't think a kid would stay quiet behind her teachers death."
"5911","130 mph I tip my hat to the father of the year"
"5912","130 mph I tip my hat to the father of the year"
"5913","Lockdown drills aren't taken seriously in my school. I had one 8th period in science class today and people will literally laughing and playing with the beakers. also we don't cover our windows to the classroom. my science teacher reprimanded all of us and told us if people were fooling around in a real situation, he'd knock them out or throw them outside."
"5914","ThaTS THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR the ""right""to  own weaponry. You americans  ARE SO SO LUCKY. i DON'T KNOW WHY OUR legislators are so uptight overhere, around 30 ppl a day getting killed because of it is a small price to pay. Besides its important kids in school learn fast about the dangers in live and learn to cope with it. 
     For us , we suffer everyday because  our ""socialist"" leaders  diminish our rights by implementing restrtictions and regulations that makes it almost impossible that everybody who is an EU citizens can get a hold of real fire-power, legally.   And all this under the guise of public safety.  Have you  ever heard of something as ridiculous  as that?"
"5915","The cop who simulated a shooting at my school used a nerf gun."
"5916","3:59 i don't think the teachers and kids will have tennis balls and be standing at the door when a random shooter comes"
"5917","I've been in a real lockdown before it was scary AF"
"5918","Well, try disarming a gunman that's prefiring, and him shooting while you're disarming him. With recoil, the gun will be way harder to control."
"5919","7:56 sticks and stone may break my bones but word will never hurt. You so sure about that?"
"5920","Who else saw that kid trying to wave at the camera at 0:51 😂"
"5921","Fuckin they look like 11 Year olds"
"5922","I was once in a real active shooter situation. These kids need to nut up. Nothing compares to when it's real. I was stuck against a wall fore 4 hours."
"5923","I would hide behind something and then run like hell out of the school and haul ass back home"
"5924","My school has a big gate in the entrance so you cannot pass when its locked, its locked from 10 - 14. Then they lock every entrance door around the school except the one with the reception. They also lock doors for saftey, we have alarms that say ""Attention, this is not a warning, proceed to the nearest exit and follow directions"" and it larms security and police"
"5925","It's just a drill, bro."
"5926","Had a guy shoot his wife across the street when I was in 5th grade lockdown for a hour and a half."
"5927","My teacher always tell us that to put the phone away during a lockdown..... So... Some rules are different."
"5928","I can imagine that girl doing that to Eric or Dylan. Just them yelling get up and the girl charges and knocks a gun out of their hands."
"5929","If only they said that it's a drill but no get down"
"5930","Can somebody tell me why the US thinks conveniently bundling in a corner is safer than running. The shooters probbaly gonna search every class."
"5931","At my school at times like this with bombs or shooters they just say get out of the school instead of hide"
"5932","This is actually a good idea. It's just like fire drills and are we complaining fire drills are scary. The best way to teach a kid to handle it is for them to see it. And seeing it for real without experience isn't good. My school keeps getting bomb threats. Maybe bomb drills should be done."
"5933","WTF I SAW MY TEACHER AT THE DRILL!!!"
"5934","In Arizona I'm currently 13 so about 4 years ago we had a man enter our campus with a gun I was scarred we never did lock downs so I was confused they told us hide on the announcement we were they're for a hour the police were checking every where the man ran away and we were fine"
"5935","Human shield at that point lol"
"5936","4:16 JOHN CENA!!!!!! Lol"
"5937","130?? why not 140?"
"5938","I wish we could have this drill bot just for safety but it looks fun."
"5939","A woman could never take out  a big guy like that"
"5940","This is a waste of time! What we need is more guards"
"5941","It that happen to me teacher: GET DOWN AND GO UNDER MY DESK me: OH HELL NO IM GOING TO KILL HIM IF HE MESS WITH US"
"5942","that looks scary!!!😡😠"
"5943","Wow  never  saw  something  that  stupid 😂"
"5944","You don't see schools in other countries having to do this."
"5945","These ""drills"" are pathetic. Whenever I had a lockdown drill back in 8th grade my teacher, a former marine, would arm up with a baseball bat, and stand by the door, while we stood out of eyesight with chairs and heavy objects ready to bombard him, and then he said once he is stunned you beat the shit out of him"
"5946","I can't be the only one here who was too young to remember the Columbine high school shooting right? I was a baby when it happened. "
"5947","That's scary"
"5948","but i good a beating people down even thow im a girl"
"5949","one day this happen holly man i was so scared i was..😨the one..
who had to fake DEAD..😐"
"5950","What's going to stop a shooter from coming around the teachers desk."
"5951","I want realistic drills at my school"
"5952","I wish my school did this XD"
"5953","Go Holly Carpenter #skills"
"5954","+RedTheSwiftYT Road To 1,000 wow that is crazy!!"
"5955","I've been in a school shooting. Believe me it was scary. At my school they locked the doors, but the shooters shot a couple rounds and destroyed the door Windows and locks."
"5956","I'm assuming that day was basically a half-day or so..."
"5957","+Clark Williams 5 hours?"
"5958","How do you do that? I'm sure I'd piss on myself because 5 hours is long as shit."
"5959","+Deedee Rood sorry. patriotism just happened"
"5960","*^* Don't need to be rude or anything.."
"5961","yeah you would, you and your ninety pounds of white hot fury. play some fucking football then come back."
"5962","+Igotbored yup"
"5963","Lemme guess, you're an Aussie?"
"5964","well school shooting is becoming a big problem in certain places"
"5965","One of my teachers said if we're in her class we each grab a text book (that is really Heavy) and stand in the corner out of sight of the door and if he gets through the locked door then we all throw the books at him/her"
"5966","If they don't say it's a fdrill on a drill they might think it's a drill on a real thing"
"5967","I find it funny how they close the door and the lights like you think that'll work? These gunmen know what you're doing they've all been in school before they've all had these practices just like you. They are prepared for that and won't be fooled."
"5968","i always carry a bb gun in my bag for thse lockdown"
"5969","Sandy hoax"
"5970","a few weeks ago they did this at my school and I was terrified thinking it was my last day alive"
"5971","What if they get too used to the drills and it's actually a real drill"
"5972","Wow I find a fire dri'll exciting"
"5973","this never made sense. Because, the people who do the shootings KNOW how the drills work. They know the students are there, they know where students hide and they have done drills themselves. Some shooters are even students in the school...they know what happens, that's why people still die...I think it'd be safer if the students jump out the windows or something. Staying isn't safe. Or maybe even push the desks to the door and stack them or something, so that the intruder can't get in?"
"5974","This brought a tear to my eye.
Why do you Americans value guns so much.  It's disgusting."
"5975","in other countries there a drills incase of fire or earthquake, in the US there are drills for school shootings. 
#onlyUSAthings
you need more guns, you will be safe. lol"
"5976","Joke"
"5977","Yeah let's throw tennis balls"
"5978","we had fake drills like this in elementry school, i dident realy mind getting out of work to do this but my only problem was all the kids around me would smell like farts, bad breath and doritos..."
"5979","if there were to be an active shooter at my school, I would not stay in the class room only just waiting to be shot. I would look to make sure it's clear then just run as far away from the school as I possibly could. if you wanna live, you don't stay, you run."
"5980","once there was a fire drill and we had to go outside (in winter) and it was a false alarm"
"5981","You could see the columbine girl putting so much effort towards the end, it's like she was fighting for what she couldn't have done before. I feel that the teacher that blogged it was a ""death rehearsal"" is right, its frightening especially for the younger generation, I believe that just teachers should be taught these drills. It could be psychologically damaging for kids"
"5982","I don't think all the training in the world can prepare you for the real thing. Look at Columbine and Sandy Hook, the shooter(s) came in guns blazing. You can't really think when you see that. You're only thought would be to run."
"5983","Why not smash the window and run for dear life away from the school?"
"5984","Omg"
"5985","School shootings are almost always done with assault rifles, not pistols!"
"5986","Why don't they.. oh don't know. LOCK THE DOOR"
"5987","In the uk we don't have gun drills I wonder why that is?"
"5988","People, (1) we need METAL/GUN SCANER MACHINES in are schools entrances. (2) We need officers in golf carts, or a vehicle patrolling around the parking lots of are school checking for any suspicions, (3) and the last most important one is strong, steel, bulletproof classroom doors."
"5989","Yea lets do an unannounced lock down drill with a fake shooter with a gun. And scare the kids who think there gonna die"
"5990","why would you call your parents are going to get them heart to"
"5991","last year, some one had called our office saying there was a bomb in our school.
We had to go into lockdown but part of that is to stay away from the windows. We were in the music room which was full of windows. 24 kids and one teacher had to hide under one desk. I remember our teacher had tried to hide everyone who couldn't fit under the desk by laying mats across our backs. Police men were running all throughout the school. 
Luckily there was no bomb and the guy that called was found."
"5992","Tbh the kids in my class would probably throw pencils at them and stuff XD"
"5993","If somebody tried this in Belfast they'd get bottled."
"5994","lol only in Merica"
"5995","Since the Cold War, things haven't changed.  Instead of students practicing Duck and Cover where students practice what to do if a nuclear bomb is detonated, they are traumatized by drills like this.  Fear is a part of a healthy childhood."
"5996","We go through this at my school, and we all said to throw all our textbooks at them, and then pounce on them"
"5997","At my sisters school, big metal shutters close on all the doors and windows, with a blaring noise and red flashing lights. They are also fireproof."
"5998","For me we lay flat on our stomachs under the desks. We recently had a situation where an angry parent came on campus with a knife. The school went on lockdown and the parent tried banging on my door"
"5999","omg i learned a lot lol"
"6000","we have to practice for this all day"
"6001","Guys in the future when I am rich I am going to move out of America... I still want my fast internet speeds any ideas?"
"6002","Give the teachers guns. That's what they do in Israel"
"6003","My school does this and it is retarded. If I hear gun shots I'm running in the opposite direction. I'm not waiting for the guy to break through the door and massacre the whole class"
"6004","Holly is my role model"
"6005","I'm all for this!
""Oh, but it'll scare the kids!""
Shut up, I don't think an actual shooter is going to play nice, so in order to train them, the fake shooter has to act like a real one!"
"6006","So I'm writing a novel predicting my future life as a Texas police officer. And the main character gets the Medal of Valor, the department's highest honor, for saving many lives in a major high school shooting, despite being seriously wounded with bullets and shrapnel. He was the arresting officer, but he survives the wounds, earns the medal, and witnesses the shooter's execution in the electric chair."
"6007","And another idea, how about we start helping the mentally challenged instead of turning them away"
"6008","If they do these to often kids will get used to the idea and won't keep quiet because they will think it is just another drill, the kids should be scared."
"6009","that teacher though. She was fierce. That look on her face when she was battling that guy, it was like she was saying ""give me that gun! you're not hurting my kids!"""
"6010","My school says CODE BLUE FORA DRILL,AND CODE RED!"
"6011","Lol the shooter wouldnt walk in that fucking fast xD"
"6012","I think in a real situation none of them are going to want to do this all going to be hiding"
"6013","Bruh their was a shooting at my school, lol everybody just runs tbh fuck the drills"
"6014","It wasn't like that when I shot up my school.







0_0 I MEAN"
"6015","It's just a prank bro!"
"6016","In my lockdown drill, most kids in my history class started talking and eating even though we were supposed to be quiet. The vice principal said he could hear our class down the hallway and we were the loudest class out of the school. Let's hope I'm not in that class if there ever was a school shooting."
"6017","only 5min drills. lol mostly 30 minsan hour almost if someone walks by a school."
"6018","Those kids didn't look very scared they were smiling!"
"6019","Wow she went to columbine !!!"
"6020","Watching this as a resident in the UK is shocking. Cannot understand America's gun laws at all. So many people in the comments saying 'give kids guns to protect themselves' etc.. how about banning guns in general? Sure, there would be the occasional event but it would limit crimes like this so much more, would it not?"
"6021","My school has now started to evacuate kids when the shooter isn't near them, and block the door and arm our selves when he is near us. Doing this instead of sitting and doing nothing makes me feel like a target but doing what we are doing now makes me feel a lot safer."
"6022","Only in the US"
"6023","I really doubt your husband was going 130 lol"
"6024","Y U NO BREAK GLASS AND GTFO IN THAT SITUATION? U HAD 5 EFFING MINUTES!"
"6025","I'm so glad that my school changed their lock down procedures. It's no longer lock the door and hide in the corner and be vulnerable and only protected by a door that is easily broken down. Now we are told to baracade doors with desks, use common objects as weapons, and try to escape by breaking the window. I feel so much more safe. All schools should fight back against shooters. Not just the teachers but also the students."
"6026","Bruh instead of getting in corners, people in my school hide in cabinets and closets, way smarter if you ask me"
"6027","So they think that putting a bunch of kids in a corner will stop them from being shot? Bullshit if a school shooter comes in with an automatic or something that's just one big target for them it's just way too easy for them"
"6028","If you want to stop school shootings ban guns. Dumb Americans"
"6029","I can tell you this right now if someones going to shoot up the school locking the door doesnt do anything their either going to shoot the lock or shoot through the door"
"6030","hey i got a idea put a fat heavy desk with some other ones one top also 5 boxes and a closet then boom your safe but if he kinda gets in but a stick it his arm this is sparta baby"
"6031","PUSSSSSYYYYYSSS"
"6032","So if a school shooter walks in with a gun what makes you think imma huddle up in the corner nigga I'm sliding down hand rails back flipping off stair cases and getting the fuck up out the school"
"6033","In Jr high we did evac drills and my principal said if it came to worse case and you don't have any other options swarm the gunman. "
"6034","does anyone know what A.L.I.C.E is? that's what my school does. all of our hallways are lettered and so if a gunman came in, the office announces where he/she is and if he was in your hallway or the ones next to it you use desks and chairs to barricade the door then stand in the back of the room, but with things like a textbook or stapler to throw at his head and distract him, even if he did get past the barricade. if he is far from your hallway, you run out the door and as far from the school as possible. it's way better than just hiding in the back of the room and i wondered if anyone else knew what it was."
"6035","i like these kinda drills. it makes the kids actualy shutup. wen we have these drills all we do is sit on the floor an continue our lesson and go on our phone... i want realistic drills"
"6036","How bout a tazer in every class?"
"6037","Hell pay me enough and I'll stay outside the school with a sniper rifle for school hours and wait for any gunmen"
"6038","I would text my mom and be like ""BITCH YOU GET YO ASS HERE NOW!"""
"6039","I have an idea, give every teacher a trip mine, so when the shooter comes through the door, his ass his blown back out the door. Problem solved, next.."
"6040","we had one i got scared i heard shooting"
"6041","one time, I was in gym class abs we had a lockdown, so we went hiding in the storage room and they forgot about its, so we were in the room for 30 mins"
"6042","Place armed veterans into the schools. period."
"6043","4:34 Hey look it's Cho!!!!"
"6044","This shouldn't be happening. Not because the drill is terrifying for everyone, but because school shootings just shouldn't occur. How did this happen to our kids?"
"6045","this is stupid,if there dong it that often the when it does happen the students will be like 'its only a drill' and be less cautios"
"6046","<<< Our teachers are training our kids to kill! Ugh Stop the ""No child Left Behind Act""! And to forced into an experiment of any kind is very unlawful! And Hovering in corner wont save your life against a psycho shooter! Ugh Last Child Oregon shooter Killed one kid and winged a teacher ""Rispler"" as he ran away! If he cowarded in a corner he would have been killed too! Nice Wrestling training though! Lol Dont be a hero, yea be a coward ? Lol  Be prepared to fight! Erf"
"6047","my school doesnt have these, we have..ok well same thing but they call they shooter the ""stranger"". like wtf"
"6048","If teachers carried guns than it would solve it. 92% of shootings happen in gun/weapon free zones because the suspect knows that know one has a weapon. If teachers carried weapons and everyone knew then it would be less likely for someone to shoot up the place because they know that all teachers are armed."
"6049","In my school when we have a lockdown, instead of keeping quiet, my classmates put Arabic music on speaker and star dancing to it😅😑😂"
"6050","Omg I remember we had a code red one time and we barricaded the fucking door with our desks be to the guy who entered the school didn't have anything he was just running from the cops he ran by our class but we were confident cause we knew a fucking T. rex couldn't get through the door😂"
"6051","i get these drills and im in 5th grade without airsoft guns though teachers come in saying ok you did well or they JIMMY YOUR A FAGGOT  YOU DID HORRIBLE YOU JUST KILLED EVERYONE!!!!!"
"6052","Why would they be huddled together, IN THE OPEN, like you could hide in cabinets or barricade the door, grab weapons, camp the door if ur a teacher, like what the fuck"
"6053","The school I went to had desks that had actually hid us from windows so it looked like an empty room"
"6054","dum USA they should ban guns"
"6055","Maybe empty the damn clip when the gunman is down."
"6056","Maybe empty the damn clip when the gunman is down."
"6057","Maybe empty the damn clip when the gunman is down"
"6058","Maybe empty the damn clip when the gunman is down"
"6059","the teachers should have there own guns"
"6060","Americans are the dumbest people I've ever seen."
"6061","What is the point of lockdowns. I mean, the intruder came into the school in the middle of the day because they knew people would be in there. It's no use pretending your not. Also, why don't they spread out across the room? If your all in one corner, there's a better chance of more people getting shot. LEAD YOUR KIDS OUT OF THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT THEM TO BE SAFE. And first of all, instead of just taking a test that youcould very possibly cheat on and being able to buy a gun, RENIFORCE THE GUN LAWS AND THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. Thank you."
"6062","Why can't America just do it like the uk, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY SCHOOL ATTACKS THAT HAVE KILLED PEOPLE EVER, do you want to know why? Because we don't give guns away like fucking lollipops. Why are Americans such retards."
"6063","lol 5 minutes is not enough time to practice a drill! ive had to stay in the corner of my class for almost an hour!!!"
"6064","04:42 you can see that the shooter can easily shoot  the children"
"6065","i wonder 110 pound teacher vs 220 pound gunmen if the gunmen is stupid sure but some shootings that happened were men out of prisons which are trained to fight  or a ex military trained in hand to hand combat or trained with a knife i would wonder who would win then  because some gunmen were ex military"
"6066","And they conviently put all the students and teachers into a corner."
"6067","*real shooting"
"6068","+VAL USA yep.. we are told to retaliate, instead of just cowarding"
"6069","+VAL USA in our school we are told to block the door with desks and tables, and then find an object that can be thrown or used as a weapon."
"6070","Exactly man or they should issue better security then cameras and 2police officers in a school of idk over 500 kids"
"6071","+Sketti n Butter no, I'm saying the drills should be changed to where they can leave and not just stay in a room when the person knows that classes are obviously going on and can easily break in. Yes, they need to leave? It's more likely for them to get hurt. Every school break in I heard of, a person got hurt and died. Maybe they should just change it a bit. Sitting and waiting isn't going to help anyone. It just makes you a damsel in distress."
"6072","I went to my home room for a ""indoor fire drill"" while i was in social class playing Apple to Apples.
The teachers blocked all the doors (there are portables too where students have classes) 
and it was during winter too.
like damn, we had fire drills once every month."
"6073","one time our principal wanted to do an experiment and ran a fire drill during a lockdown"
"6074","Is that really that big of a deal ... Get over yourself kid"
"6075","They can shoot the lock. Nothing stops an insane gunman."
"6076","+Olivia Fuqua  nah , i like how you say Africa . . . Thats not true "
"6077","+Olivia Fuqua *Most retarded and inaccurate comment on YouTube! 😂😂 Stay in school, kid."
"6078","+my life as dee In Africa not many people have guns..."
"6079","in south africa , some of our classes are outside in the back of the school , so our back doors are always open"
"6080","I overreacted, but I still don't appreciate you disregarding and invalidating my argument."
"6081","I really don't care...we live on the same planet...just don't agree with guns being legal. I didn't insult anyone. You're just being rude. Good luck getting someone to see something from your perspective by calling them a cunt. I'm done with this conversation. Bye."
"6082","+Samantha Richards you pussies lost in the revolution, idk what your tea ass is talking about, America is, and always will be better."
"6083","I have made many points whether valid or not. It is you who has not said anything of value"
"6084","lmfao absolutely nothing. Bye."
"6085","+I'm a Koala not Cobra Against a gun? nothing. against a human? incapacitate him."
"6086","+Justaburgscuzzin there are terrible teachers in schools, and also, what if a student gets a hold of it? That's a huge no-no."
"6087","Or the teacher has a gun"
"6088","+amlux gaming o yeah 🍆🍑"
"6089","not sure if irony or..."
"6090","+FrostyMkay I sure did"
"6091","oh the irony"
"6092","""Dum USA"""
"6093","yes because a rifle is a staple of a party favor. fucking do your research before making BULLSHIT FUCKING COMMENTS YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKTARD. America."
"6094","At least we have rights."
"6095","oh and by the way fuck off you British cunt we won the revolutionary war for a reason. that reason was to become the best goddamn country In the world and we have succeeded"
"6096","+tykkeo Dunblane school massacre"
"6097","Same"
"6098","same!!!!"
"6099","+Conner Little seems legit"
"6100","Try 10 hours mate in a musty hot school locker room"
"6101","Same, seems like a nice waste of time for a little while but then it just gets boring, but in my school nobody pretends to be a shooter we just lock the door and go in the corner"
"6102","only in the USA...."
"6103","All fun and games until a student dies of a heart attack when they do one of those drills."

Students just laugh when it comes to drills associated with attacks, because we know it won't happen due to the fact that attaining guns is almost impossible since the gun ban.

""If you aren't governed by god will be ruled by tyrants"" Thomas jefferson. only guns in the hands of brave teachers or principals can stop an angry student that has murder as an objective. they will never even get thru the door. it is just like having a police officer watching over our kids 100% of the time and 100% of the active shooters will be killed by school administrators BEFORE any of our kids are EVER harmed. trust our teachers they will do the right thing."

"6140","There is absolutely no reason for people to hide behind desks and chairs. It is awesome to see that teachers are getting the training to protect their students from an active gunman!

Yes the police are on their way, but what happens in the time before they arrive is absolutely critical to the safety of the students and faculty."

"6161","One of the many problems with this system is that there are TOO MANY DRILLS!

The kids, in a real situation would THINK It's just a drill and start joking around (This happens at my school with fire drills (We've never had a fire but we have unannounced fire drills))"
"6162","I had one today it was real because this girl said she saw a student with 2 hand guns then 5 police cars came turns out there was no weapon found on campus when we had a lockdown everyone was smiling and laughing and uhhh! If we where in real danger we would all be dead because of them.Before we found out the girl was lyin the principle said it was not a drill."

"6251","+AustinG Australia, Japan etc etc. I actually have kind of changed my opinion. The reason they work for some countries is because they have no access but if the U.S. made it illegal its not like people who already own guns that their guns would just disapear. For countries like japan though its been illegal for so long that its much much much much much harder to get access to them. "

"6253","To prevent a school shooting, it can all be easily solved.. Just a metal scanner. You know the ones in the airports? All schools need a metal/gun scanner right now! I need to be president!"
"6254","Guys, I'm not looking for any disagreement so please don't judge. However, I have a solution that may help. The faculty should be allowed to carry (NOT the students, because they would be more likely to use unauthorized fire), because then there wouldn't be as many innocent bystanders getting hurt. A shooter can't murder any more people if they're dead. Or if for some reason a teacher doesn't want to kill the shooter, they can shoot him in the gut (this will make the shooter double over, allowing the classes to disarm the shooter and the police to take the shooter into custody). I shoot my pistol out on the firing range sometimes, so I'm trained so that in the event I was in a situation like this at home, I could kill (or wound) the shooter before the shooter kills me.


Another suggestion that many of the larger schools have tried is having millimeter wave scanning (or a metal detector for that matter) and/or armed guards.


Both could work. Feedback would be appreciated, but like I say, I don't want to start further comment wars or anything."

"6316","It is the signs, otherwise 92% of shootings wouldn't be in gun free zones. They want a weak target. And a person should first learn to use a gun as soon as they can hold one. Kids get it drilled into there head better when they are young."
"6317","+Ketchikan King Salmon There should be age restrictions on when someone can first learn to use a gun. And the gun free zones have nothing to do with mental health. If someone snaps, their mind is one thing, regardless of what's around them. Do not blame the signs. It's the person, not the signs, sherlock."
"6318","And why shouldn't kids be around guns? If they are responsible and have a parent to teach them the ropes, what harm is it? And kids are matured as soon as a responsible parent teaches them how to BE mature.  I do know basic psychology. That's why I said ""KIDS ARE CURIOUS"" But I have to ask, You do know the fact that schools are gun free zones is the exact fucking reason this shit is happening? Right?"
"6319","+Ketchikan King Salmon
Kids shouldn't be near guns. Kids are not fully matured yet. You don't know basic psychology. Nice try. Weapons used by people that kill are not safe. Don't use the responsible adult excuse. It's pathetic."

26 people were gunned down and she is leaving to get teacher a pair of shoes!
does that make sense to you?
it just sounds too fucking stupid to believe.

how do you explain all the fucking dry eyed people walking circles aroud the fire house that already were set up?

how do you explain the cars blocking the way, no cars in and no cars out, in other words the EMS could not leave to take the wound to the hospital.
it was nothing more than a drill.
do more research or keep you head in the sand and remain ignorant to what is fucking painfully obvious +CoolNala"
"6332","+CivicSTS Sorry if you think I am mind-controlled by the media, Because you're wrong. You can't even spell dude or enough. Yeah, you are clearly intelligent.  Nice try. If Sandy Hook was a conspiracy, why weren't Columbine or Virginia Tech considered to be either, despite the fact that gun control was brought up both times? Obviously, that's not the reason Sandy Hook has a ""conspiracy"". Ask yourself this. If Obama was white, and Lanza was any other race or ethnicity, would there be a conspiracy? The answer: No."
"6333","+CoolNala
so that means you believe sandy hook really happened?
c'mon dood, clearly you havent done enugh research."
"6334","+CivicSTS​ Noone paid me anything Einstein. Sorry to disappoint you, but I do my own research and am educated. "
"6335","Well, let's face it, there's just never been a gun culture in Britain. Gun fanatics have always been marginal. It seems that in the States - especially in the south - owning a gun is as common as using a microwave oven."
"6336","But England used to have guns, we had them almost as freely as the US does now and there was only 1 school shooting ever recorded. After that, Dunblane massacre, guns were made stricter and now we don't have a problem with them"
"6337","Oh really? Thanks for that, I missed today's news."
"6338","Too bad the British have pretty much given up all their rights to the government."
"6339","+Smith of Smiths True, there would be carnage."
"6340","+Smith of Smiths Who is going to control the guns?  Our worst criminal, our worst mass murderers, the people who use our military to attack nations that haven't attack us - our politicians?  I would trust the first person on the street before I would trust them.  Firearms are too dangerous to allow our home-grown hitlers and stalins to ""control""."
"6341","+abukamoon No one needed Sandy Hook as a good reason for gun control. Controlling guns is reason in itself."
"6342","Right. And Columbine, Virginia Teach, Aurora, Luby's Cafe, and San Diego McDonald's massacres didn't happen. I think I know why there is a ""conspiracy."" Let's see... An African-American, Liberal President, who wants gun control... A massacre involving children with a ""random"" white male in a northern school... A push for tougher gun laws afterwards... Yeah, right... Those equal conspiracy. Here's a fact for you. After any massacre, period, there will always be a push for gun control. That's a fact. Get over it. Two, tell me... if Adam was any other race, would there be a conspiracy? Probably not. And, finally, don't waste your time and effort on a futile cause."

"6350","+Jordan Wendt dude i read your comment and i thought eh what??? but 3 seconds later i connected the dots :) yes the baby murdering needs to end"
"6351","+Ernie C They had the yellow tape up the day before the ""massacre"" happened.  The CT State Police released a photo of Dr. Carver and the SWAT team standing in front of the Sandy Hook school with the yellow tape up - before the windows were ""shot out"".  The photo was obviously taken on the 13th at the rehearsal of the event."
"6352","+Stephen Waddock the shooter himself and the mother which was a ""separate crime scene"" even though no photos of that are available since it's clearly obvious nothing took place there"
"6353","I guess, you being an expert in determining what the ""truth"" is, could then explain what would have caused the impact mark the size of a 757 while bending all the beams inward. Right?

See, logic and ability to comprehend ""evidence"" just isn't in your skill set."
"6354","+wendy thompson You don't need an ambulance when one is dead."
"6355","Because everyone was dead at the scene, that's why there wasn't any ambulances rushing anyone to the hospital."
"6356","+neobeta Hahaha!  A moral country - that aborts it's babies and has gay pride parades.  And the most evil and immoral people in our culture are out politicians.  They have no problem killing if it serves their purpose.  When they do show bodies at these fake shootings, they are usually manikins like those at the LAX ""massacre""."
"6357","+wendy thompson First of all they don't want to show injured people on tape dude, it brings down the moral of the country. That's why they will not show ambulances. Second of all the schools website is checked by parents who expect to see news information on that page concerning their family members, it is live update by webmasters. Idiots saying this is a hoax are ridiculous human beings, people lost their lives and to say its a hoax is a direct slap in the face to the people who lost loved ones. Get a life please."

"6368","+William Tyndale Except that's a lie. There are plenty of photos showing bullet holes in the wall, glass, ceilings and the cars in the front parking lot. There was plenty of bio waste cleaned up by the firm, Clean Harbors....AND the school was not in the condition YOU claim it was. It had passed Ct State Inspection and was, in fact, open.

"6392","first off I'm just stating my opinion feel free to agree or disagree, but i feel that whether this incident was hoaxed or in fact completely real, these children are victims either way. if they really died then thats sad and they didn't deserved to die so young. and if it's staged by the government to pursue stricter gun laws, these children are still victimised by being used in such a way. if in fact they are still alive, they will never have a normal life or childhood cuz half America says they're dead and half America is claiming they are alive still. so either way they are victims regardless in my opinion."

Instead of putting armed security in every school to prevent them from being targeted they want to make bullshit gun laws that only hurt people who abide the law (criminals don't follow laws) stop trying to remove the ability for law abiding citizens to defend themselves and hire some people to protect our fucking children."

Due to confusion, people are killing indiscriminately, and then law enforcement shows up. They do not know who shot first. They want to minimize casualties. Suddenly crossfire from this battle royale of citizens kills a young mother. The police, in confusion, decide to shoot anything that is shooting. What could have been a (in comparison to the scenario I described) relatively simple shooting has turned into a bloodbath, comparable to skirmishes the U.S. Army and the Taliban experience. Yes, more guns definitely would help the situation."

"7133","Luby's"
"7134","Good answere Marilyn Manson"
"7135","The U.S have to get it`s act together, take the Virginia Tech shooter if he had been considered a danger to himself and others the shooting had never happend the same thing would have prevented the Columbine shooting. And I feel that there need to be a law that say that those that suffer from an anti social disorder, have been arrested for crimes like manslaughter, domestic abuse, drug possesion should not be aloud to own fire arms."
"7136","I think they need to rename the word, 'school' to 'shooting range' in america jeez"
"7137","stay tuned next week when we update ten new ones!!"
"7138","stop this gun control bs! we don't need gun control, we need marilyn Manson! come on, did you hear what he said at the end? ""I would listen to what they have to say and that's what no one did"""
"7139","I was staying at a hotel near the San Ysidro McDonalds when that one went down. Total confusion. People forget about all these mass killings from the 70s and 80s and seem to think that its just a recent development in this country."
"7140","at 1:29 the sad part is they never suspected a black guy of the shootings. They spent all there time chasing a white van along with a white male"
"7141","at 1:29 the sad part is they never suspected a black guy of the shootings. They spent all there time chasing a white van along with a white male"
"7142","I remember the Virginia Tech Massacre. I was in 2nd Grade, there was a day when they told us to were Virginia Tech T-Shirts and had us pause for a full school-wide moment of silence in the middle of the day."
"7143","how much more longer until top ten best 9/11 fatalities"
"7144","HAHA Way to go, White People."
"7145","Uh Sandyhook?"
"7146","Marilyn Manson ''I would listen to what They had to say...'' #memorable"
"7147","Funny, but I thought White Lives Matter.  I guess it does matter when a white person is murdering another white person.  Why didn't someone call Rush Limbaugh and Ronald Reagan?"
"7148","so where is kent state massacre?"
"7149","Now I'm kinda afraid to go to school"
"7150","you americans are nutjobs"
"7151","How violent you animal christians are. You're all terrorists that commit crime and murder under the bible. I judge a worldwide religion that does not stand by this concept  by looking this video. It's stupid how people are so ignorant. Fuck everyone that supports donald dump."
"7152","kids shot up there school because of bullying the teachers don't give a fuck about the bullied when alive and when there dead."
"7153","Only in north america and this shit keep going on"
"7154","We need to do something to lessen the shootings happening"
"7155","Is there gonna be a update on this do to the recent events..."
"7156","And 9 days after this video was made, sandy hook happens..."
"7157","my dad was in #4 😵"
"7158","the only thing I can say is that mental health care in the US is extremely skewed and the shear fact is that so many people are threats but still walk free. religious beliefs, the worst health care, and dumbass's only worsen the problem"
"7159","These people saying ban guns, it's not the gin, it is the person, man kills man, not the gun."
"7160","I can remember the Columbine high school massacre, it made me cry watching this, even though I'm 22 years old. That was one of the worst days I have seen on the television."
"7161","where you live?"
"7162","+DruidsCalling You are gay"
"7163","+RogerBrideau that was a hoax, along with the paris attacks, san bernandino, sandy hook, charleston, james holmes, and virginia news reporter shooting"
"7164","+RogerBrideau Definitely yes!!"
"7165","+bowens92 yeh such a fail, so many preparations but it didn't work out the way they wanted:/"
"7166","+bowens92 Lol!!!!"
"7167","+Allosaurus Fragilis why do you ask?"
"7168","Is group sex common down under?"
"7169","Me too"
"7170","oh yeahhhh, his video about watch mojo lol"
"7171","No he wasnt. I know you are thinking about Elliot Rodger. He was a youtuber"
"7172","who was it?"
"7173","+ChefCharles A dude tried to stop the mass shooting in Tucson and ran in with his own weapon, almost shot the dude who actually stopped the original shooter. The man who ran in blind with his weapon is now a conservative gun rights hero activist and the man who tackled the shooter isn't even noticed."
"7174","+Lionel Messi never go full retard"
"7175","+Allosaurus Fragilis they worry about you getting stabbed "
"7176","+MANUAL SHIFT a fair point i suppose.  Like many in the uk i have friends and family in the US and while i dont think they are going to get shot anytime soon , the way things are going over there is concerning."
"7177","Why should a non-american, presumably such as yourself, have the right to say whether or not it should be easier or harder to get firearms?  Unless it is causing a direct affect on where you live, it doesn't concern you."
"7178","+Allosaurus Fragilis No, i just recognize that a ton of deaths happen due to gang activity, and basically all mass shootings occur in ""gun-free zones"""
"7179","+Allosaurus Fragilis what do you think we should do then? "
"7180","+Chase Hilyer i don't have time to read all your comments, background checks would be effective if mentally ill people were on record the same as felons."
"7181","+Chase Hilyer You're stupid. The place with the highest gun violence in the US is Detriot. Detriot has the toughest gun laws in the entire United States. Check your facts."
"7182","+dgaller06 You said you don't care WHY they decide to do this? Why not? Is it too scary for you, the thought of trying to empathize (empathy and sympathy are different, use google please if you don't already know the difference) for someone who kills? wouldn't we be able to stop these things from happening if we knew why they happened?

Just appears as though you're absolutely shutting out the want for knowledge and understanding is what seemed naïve to me."
"7183","+Riley Freeman There's no point in making an argument. Every American is brainwashed by their government, and it's quite sad to watch actually. How the government successfully managed to convince them that gun control isn't a problem I will never know, as if guns aren't allowed then obviously no one will get them. You can grow drugs, but you can't grow guns. It's the same with Donald Trump brainwashing America, making them think that all Muslims are terrorists. So glad I live in England instead of corrupt America."
"7184","+B.A. MOFO Because there's so much of a difference. The sentiment is the same."
"7185","I said fuckin white ppl... not fuck white ppl."
"7186","+B.A. MOFO ""Fuck white people"", whatever you say nig."
"7187","I love everyone. Thanks for the comment!"
"7188","+B.A. MOFO Fuck off nigger-lover. WHITE PRIDE WORLDWIDE!"
"7189","+Sal Ami No, I got it from the FBI."
"7190","+MasterVideoStudios Did you get that statistic out of a joke book?"
"7191","+Riley Freeman England has the highest crime rate in Europe. "
"7192","I give it 7/10"
"7193","+Vance Stone Also Lots of Americans who own gunsfor their own protection. I have a friend who lived in Texas and she lived on a street where everyone had a gun or two. She didn't since her parents didn't believe or want guns in their home. Most of the people in their neighborhood got their houses broken into because they had guns and her house was never touched. 

I live in Canada and you can own a gun for hunting or recreational shooting practice but not to protect yourself. I have never heard a gun shot and there haven't been that many shootings here that were crazy people going on a killing spree for revenge. There have been shooting, but they have been gang related and those people were just caught in the cross firee. "
"7194","Yeah what's with all the top tens"
