""we cant ban guns because it violates our rights"" but guns can be banned because like i said my country and many others have done so and there weren't any other mass murders again...how oblivious are you kid?  and let me guess your going to give me the whole ""its in our amendment blah blah blah, its called an amendment for a reason you know kid, every country has one, just because america makes big deals over the littlest things doesn't mean they're big deals :) 
im guessing your still in school? by the lack of intelligence you have thats my guess anyway, i hope the next one happens in your school :) see how great it is to ""have rights"" to own a gun"

"123","This guy is stupid. I can't belevie he wants to end people lives. The people who got hurt or killed has no reason to be like that. Now People in heaven or in the hospital is now suffering from the injures from this kid who was 19. The moral of the shooting is to never end someone live even though u don't know them. Don't do anything stupid like this. This was a bad choice to make. This kid put his life in jeopardy now this kid in jail for killing beautiful,kind, caring children. So please don't put your life in danger or in jeopardy like him. Thank you."

"220","+NotMorne 
Hey hey hey, easy now. We can talk, or you can attempt to insult me.
The key word there is ""almost"". The key point I brought up, is the *rise* of knife crimes. If you think taking legal guns away will stop people from getting guns, you probably aren't aware of how many already get them *illegally* . I'm not even really pro gun, I don't need a gun. I just don't think taking them will help and it is in fact denying people of their rights, to force them to give them up.
A crazy person can wield a knife just as easily as they could wield a gun and a knife can be obtained, if the gun cannot.
I happen to believe losing one person to murder, is just as bad as losing ten people.
Did you know civilian gun owners save the lives of 500,000 up to 3 million people each year in the U.S.? 
So, right there you have up to 3 million people who could be involved in deadly gun violence, if they decide to take everyone's gun's. Remember criminals don't need to get them legally."

"226","You 10 year old loser, think about Nikolas Cruz's state, He reached a point where he couldn't control himself, his mental health should've been looked at. Also, For your damn information being a psychopath doesn't mean you go around killing people, it's a real mental disorder that can cause abnormal, unsocial, and sometimes violent behavior. Learn to educate yourself before you say some stupid shit."

In another video, police are seen loading a limp body onto a white pickup, Nicolas Cruz, then Cruz is arrested in jeans & red shirt totally unconscious. This was a coordinated effort by FBI, COWARD County sheriff's dept. & David Hogg. Start using your brains SHEEPLE, connect the dots. Hoggs statements are bullshit.

1.Grab a book
2.Grab a fire extinguisher (idk if i spell'd that right)
3.Grab a pen or something Sharp

5.If he/her Shoots Use the fire extinguisher to blind him/her
6.Pretend to be like a ninja! Grab a pen or something sharp

Think about this, if you want only police to have guns to protect, that's also like saying you want all fire extinguishers to be removed and to have only firefighters use tools related to it. That'd get us killed.  Why do you think all those kids at Sandy Hook got killed? Because they had to sit there and wait for police to arrive. I don't know why there's people like you that want the government to have complete control over everything. Take charge of things in your life, because youre causing a whole lot of stress on those who have to deal with your problems AND their own."

I paused it and went full screen and didn't see anything about him killing anyone honestly. It was just gun talk with other people that liked weapons. he even had a knife that he had custom made the handle part.

Also, he was RIGHT THERE! One of 219 people could have stopped him! The world is sleeping man... smh... people need to wake up to prevent something like this from happening again.

Change the purchase laws!.. Jesus...

Maybe the school shooters are assets of someone with higher power which investigator haven't found their true motives... assets to do the dirty work to motivated schools to act... 

Either way its all bullshit! The 17 who died didn't deserve such a horrible fate even those whom died in the past school shooting. No student or teacher deserve such evil."

Der Geisteskranke tötet alle und dann sich selbst, wessen schuld ist es jetzt das alle tot sind?! Die des Geisteskranken oder die des Staates, die einfach willkürlich Waffen an alle verteilt.

Like Sandy Hook and then come back and respond to me. Look up Robbie Parker. Crisis actors. Gene Rosen....The timeline doesn't add up. The abolishing of the 2nd Amendment. Gun Control. I'm not saying this is always the case, but just look a little deeper. Research the illuminati and the Free Masons. Skull and bones. Bohemian Grove and our politicians having Satanic Rituals there aka making policies there on how to police America, keeping the vast majority of the public lost and easily fooled. They have the tools to so so, and have had it for so long. Seek TRUTH, even if it seems unreal. Usually love, it's stranger than fiction. This case is very strange. Hope this helps.

There are no threats in any of these posts, I don't see the red flag."

Well I just noticed that on the news long time ago OHHHH DID U GUYS KNEW THAT THERE was a circus right in front of where I live I didn't get to go but the circus was called Volta and this man died..  I feel so bad for him and he's family but uhhh he fell and he died and he haded 2 children and a wife.. O.o that's why I don't go to circus I don't trust CLOWNS..  Only one type of clowns that I saw 😂 I went to the fair it was hilarious..  But anyways I don't trust other clowns with chain saws and other weapons..  I guess that nvm I better never give that idea out cause who knows when they're going to dress up into everything oh and guess what I went to a hunted house and the man that used to kill alot that didn't get cought and finally he got caught on Christmas month?  IDK and we went to a hunted house and we were going on the first one and this dude was running and the cops were after him and that wasn't even supposed to have cops chasing a person..  So the place was closed for like 5 minutes it was scary as heck really but It was fun :) SADLY I had my make up on as a skeleton but uh they dont let face paint on..  Cause of the dangers and usually it was hilarious OK enough typing about me IM DONE TYPING bye!  I hope u enjoy this annoying a*$ story about a little bit of what happend. In my past, :)"
"1032","Um I afraid this kid is gonna be uh a dangerous person on insta like he followed me I followed him back even if I don't know him he's a kid and he seems 13 or 14 or maybe  15 he like post guns and all that and I said to my self if he continues to post more guns then I'm going to say hey u better stop posting that before 1 I go to the cops and 2 ILL UNFOLLOW U!"

"1038","I know these people are clearly upset and for good reason but they aren't thinking logically and blaming the guns when they're not the problem. Someone could do nearly the same thing with a kitchen knife or even more damage with a car or van so should we ban those. No. I think banning guns isn't going to work but i think mental health evaluations before buying a gun of any kind. 1 other thing I think is wrong with this video is they're saying that anyone who posts pictures or videos of guns should be reported. I'm BY NO MEANS saying that if someone's making threats (that's when you should report them) not to report them but that just because someone has an interest in guns or knifes and wants to share they're interest's with other people DOES NOT mean they're going to shoot up the local school, it just means they're expressing theyre interests. I'm neutral in this debate as I'm from Ireland and guns aren't a huge thing here(unfortunately) and neither of my parents own guns and I've never held a real one other than when i went on a visit to the army barracks with scouts a couple of years ago but i intended to get 1 when I'm 16. Btw I'm 14 an i have more sense than most of the liberals in your country as i wont blame an inanimate object for things that happen. You don't blame misspelled words on your pencil, so why blame a gun for someone's actions."

"1051","“Assault” style rifled. This is truly a comical phrase I constantly keep hearing. He states, he does not have much knowledge on firearms, (clearly) however, possess common sense but can’t comprehend the logic behind the legal age to buy a rifle and a handgun. Maybe you should start off by acquiring the brain capacity to understand the definition of assault, then learn how to use the word properly and stop misguiding people. It’s a truly despicable display of humanity when everyone is so admit about blaming and pointing fingers on why this happened as if it’s not the shooters fault? These disgusting creatures that call themselves humans are mocking in the faces of the families who lost their loved ones by using them in vain. Pushing agendas buy promoting dead children? Does anyone look themselves in the mirror and understand how they sound? What is wrong with this country?"

Another thing is that he shot up a school, he’s a dumbass, ok? There’s no way a 19 year old couldve gotten 3 grand for ammo and a gun from his parents he either stole money, the gun, or sold a lot of stuff and bought it. But if guns are banned, people will use other types of guns to kill, also if these kids can get their hands on bombs, how could they not get their hands on a little handgun if guns are banned"

"1187","mahi zen ""shoots very fast"" ""holds many rounds"", really... An AR15 is first off not an assault rifle. ""Assault Rifle"" is a scare tactic made up by the media. Next, if someone is good enough a shot they don't need a hi capacity magazine (notice it is not Called a clip). Another 5 rounds won't matter if I just buy another magazine, so why limit that 5 extra rounds when I can mag dump 3 of those magazines and end up killing the same number of people.

You said the shoot fast, well yes thy do. They shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger, just like every other gun ever created. Full automatic weapons require a special permit with extensive background checks. Lastly tell me this: Why focus on the AR15 and similer rifles? There are many guns that shoot bigger bullets, and do more damage.For example, a shotgun can kill many times more people than an AR15 in just one shot. Please check facts before your facts before spreading more fake propoganda for ""liberal homodumbs"" to use as an argument in their big dumb debates."

But it is changing. More and more people are waking up every day, even as the New World order tries harder to gull them into stupid acceptance of their crimes. I recommend everyone view ""Sandy Hook Crisis Actors Robbie Parker"" and ""Sandy Hook Crisis Actors David Wheeler"" for a start. Also anything by Jim Fetzer and Ole Damegaard on the subject. ""Jim Fetzer Florida Shooting"" is good. Then research all the fake shootings as you have the time. They all stink to high heaven of a conspiracy to disarm America by subterfuge.

Cruz had assaulted people while he was in school, and the authorities did not arrest him because the county was trying to reduce the disproportionate number of arrests of minority students, because their thinking was that not only does a criminal record hurt a student's future and makes them more likely to be an adult criminal which is why it would be better to have alternative ""treatments"" for their criminal behavior, but these minority students are arrested more because of discrimination (which is obviously not true as you can look up the crime statistics by race and see that minority students, or really black and Hispanic, do commit proportionately more crimes).  This is all of course completely swept under the rug by the media.  You can look it all up.  It's not a conspiracy theory.

You're deluded about the Bahamas.  Their crime rate might be lower than the U.S.'s but that does not mean they are some low-maintenance country in terms of crime where the police can effectively do their job without a gun.

https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/caribbean/the-bahamas/crime-in-the-bahamas

Most gun crimes are committed by people who do not legally own the gun used in the crime.  They either steal them, buy them off the black market or through a straw purchase.  

http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/

Criminals do not follow the law when it come to gun control.  If they are already thinking about committing a crime, they are not going to let a background check and a waiting period stop them, especially if they are considering a murder-suicide shooting spree.  Convicted criminals STILL find ways to access guns.  

Australia's gun crime rate was already low prior to gun control.  A lot of factors when it comes to crime and violence have to do with things OTHER than gun laws.  You can't point out single examples of gun control in low gun crime countries and cite that as proof gun control works, because there are countries with low crime and laxer gun control laws or higher gun ownership.  You can even find these contradictory examples in the U.S. among states and cities, e.g. California and Texas.

Also gun violence and crime in general in the U.S. has been going down.  It still is.  The fact is that most gun violence can be attributed to either suicide or gang- or drug-related crimes.  Even more so most gun violence happens in particular areas, not all over the place, and mass shootings aren't even a significant portion of gun violence.  Yes, something SHOULD be done about it, but considering that the local authorities and the feds wouldn't even enforce the existing laws for arresting a person committing a crime, perhaps we should start by having them do that and repealing this stupid, bullshit affirmative action policy for arrests by race.  Remember, if that policy didn't exist and the authorities had actually acted competently, Cruz would have had a criminal record show up in his background check at the gun stores, and he would not have legally been allowed to buy a gun."
"1389","+Tracer413 The police and feds did nothing to stop Cruz prior to his shooting because there was this silly policy enacted by Broward County to deliberately avoid arresting students in an effort to improve arrest records.  Seriously, you can look it up.  It's an affirmative action policy designed to decrease the disproportionate amount of minority students arrested for crimes.  IF CRUZ HAD BEEN ARRESTED LIKE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HIS CRIMES PRIOR, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRIMINAL RECORD OF HIM APPEAR IN HIS BACKGROUND CHECK AND THUS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEGALLY PURCHASE THE GUNS.  How these imbeciles can complain that more laws need to be passed when they ignore the fact that the existing laws weren't applied is beyond reason.

The mental health record thing is a silly idea.  People will simply just not seek treatment for their mental illnesses if they know it will make it harder to buy a gun.  Also, exactly what mental illnesses and to what extent do you qualify as making someone as unfit to own a gun?  Too many problems come from that idea."
"1390","+random S  Actually, bombs that can bee made from houshold chemicals and run-over-pedestrians"" attacks *have killed MORE people (more ""Efficiently"") than guns, per attacker...* so it's actually to our benefit to let the idiot psycho mass-shooters keep using guns, i.e. the LESS efficient weapon, so that they will not SEEK OUT bomb-making manuals or study how others attaced pedestrians by watching for times-of-day when the sidewalks were fullest, etc."
"1391","+Jing Li What makes you think that more gun laws don't lead to a gun ban, and that the only argument is ""no guns at all"" vs. ""more gun control""?  The fact of the matter is by your own argument gun control doesn't work.  We have tons of problems that stem from the federal government's ban on certain kinds of drugs.  If those drugs were more accessible, those problems would for the most part go away.  So if banning drugs only makes the problems worse, how will banning guns from certain people improve anything?  Most gun crimes are committed with guns the perpetrator did not legally own, and Cruz never would have even been allowed to legally buy a gun had the police not deliberately avoided arresting him in order to improve arrest records for students in Broward County."
"1392","+EarthCamper.com+Vinay By ""woke up"" do you mean have their emotions manipulated by the left?  Because all they're doing is virtue signaling.  Absolutely none of these students on the side of more gun control have cited any relevant data on gun violence and gun control besides the usual cliche statistics used by the left.  None have even so much as stated the gun laws already in place would have been enough to stop Cruz had they been enforced."

"1396","+C Cato I see.  So if at one point in your life you were depressed for a few months and now are better, does that mean you should not have the right to own a gun?  Hmm, I wonder if any unintended consequences could come from such a policy...."
"1397","+David Dutka You ought to educate yourself on what is considered a ""mass shooting"" by crime statisticians, because it is not necessarily going on a shooting spree in a public place where the shooter doesn't care if he's caught.  Furthermore there were 372 ""mass shootings"" in 2015, which if memory serves me correctly was under Obama's term.  That is more than one mass shooting per day, which means even 20 in 2 months is STILL a lower rate under Trump than under Obama.  (Not that I think any of this is good, or is some sort of pissing contest.  I'm just making the point that you are ignorantly and falsely claiming we have more mass shootings while Trump is president than Obama.)

It's also been a bipartisan effort to increase the amount of psychotropic drugging of children in this country for several decades now.  Many of these school mass shooters are on SSRI's, which have a known side effect of violence and suicide.  Of course neither party is talking about that.

Then there's the affirmative action, political correctness policy that stopped authorities from arresting Cruz, which would have made him ineligible to buy those guns legally since it would give him a criminal record.  Let's start by applying the laws we already have and cut out this crap that the only reason minorities commit a disproportionate amount of crime is due to racism."
"1398","Nobody said Trayvon was convicted, so you're making a Straw Man violation of logic; get your logic circuits fixed kid: *""Trayvon Martin was not convicted of felonies...""*  Indeed the guy you misquoted made the complaint that Dem Party policy is *to NOT convict innercity kids (so you're not even contradicting what he wrote, you ILLITERATE moron.  He ALREADY SAID that Trayvon and the FL school shooter were NOT convicted (so you've NOT contradicted him!!!), but he notes that they both easily could have been convicted if not for BLACK AND WHITE ON PAPER, i.e. WRITTEN, DEMOCRAT POLICY (if you deny that policy, therefore, you are DELUSIONAL): see next paragraph, for ""why"" he says that.  How come we ALL can ""discern"" what he said (He has about 5 more thumbs-up than your ZERO thumbs-up.), but you cannot?  That indicates the problem is with your reading skills AND YOUR LOGIC CIRCUITS, not his writing skills.*

His point was that *instead of PRESSING CHARGES when Trayvon was caught with Burglary Tools and old lady's jewelry in his school locker,* to get Trayvon and all the similar little hooligans mental help, or a Parole Officer who's breathing down their neck (compared to the other kids) or other court mandated ""early intervention"" (to quote what he wrote), *instead, the Dem Party mayors, sheriffs, etc made a policy to NOT EVEN TRY to get convictions on kids like Trayvon or the FL school-shooter.  Do I need to CONNECT The DOTS FOR YOU: 1. They coulda TAKEN AWAY the FL school-shooter's gun rights, IF they had pursued felony convictions against that kid for his misbehavior YEARS before he sht-up the school -- instead of ONLY kicking him outta school -- you idiot.  He WAS the prime suspect in SEVERAL FELONIES for YEARS before he shot-up the school, but Democrats ran the school's police and the POLICY (not only his specific case) of these RACIST SJW's who run Broward's police is to REFUSE to even TRY to convict minority-race students.*  2. Trayvon maybe wouldn't be PEEKING INTO WINDOWS when Zimmerman was 'patroling' his neighborhood (and this no fight nor gun-play wouda happened if Zimmerman hadn't seeen Trayvon peeking into windows that night...) *if Trayvon had a P.O. breathing down his neck for his PRIOR Possession Of Burglary Tools or even more serious Grand Larceny conviction.  But he too lived in a jurisdictin where police/mayors/etc are Democrats with this RACIST and FANGEROUS policy.*  So they REFUSED to even TRY (ie. refuse to press charges on non-white ids, AS A POLICY.

So yes, we all fucking AGREE ALREADY WITH YOU THAT TRAYVON WAS NOT CONVICTED, ya clueless ass-hat."

This is why we talk about this to people like you! you can not own a atuomatic weapon just about every hand gun rife shotgun are semi-auto NOT fully auto you jake asses are agruing for shit you know nothign about! but for a giggle look fully auto, semi-atuo, and since you dont like the scary black AR-15 look up a mini-14 same ammo shoots just as fast but isnt the scary black one lol!! if you wann ban something atleat know what your banning first!"
"1414","doesnt make you a gun expert tho?? just sayin!!!

iv drove a car over 100 before doesnt mean nascar is gonna be calling soon to drive they'res!!!"
"1415","SOLUTIONS: *Metal detectors are proven* to get even crazy people (drunk on Allah) to stop shooting up Jew kids/Jew schools.  *Banning guns is proven to... get cartels -- or despots -- having a MONOPOLY on firepower,* which they abuse.  *""Power corrupts,"" and a MONOPOLY on economic power, MONOPOLY on firepower, or MONOPOLY on media power, etc, is what ""corrupts absolutely"" as the saying goes.  The Zetas cartel are the **google.com/search?q=NOMENKATURA** cronyinsts of PRI* (socialist party of MEX), journalist Carmen Arristegui proved -- *including the president (Senor Socialist Pena Nieto) paid to ""look the other way"" as kidnappings (usually with RAPE until the father pays)/sex-slavery (combined) for a MEX woman today = 15% before she hits age 65.  15% of all women.*  Men are harder to kidnap, so it's more rare unless you're part of an enemy cartel, but then torture-instead-of-rape is typical.

Also, *MOST cartel guns are traced to the insanely high 1-in-8 soldiers in MEX'S OWN ARMY who go AWOL -- with their rifle.*  And CORRUPT OBAMA DIRECTLY ARMED cartels with a few thousand more.  So again, the Dem Party ""solution"" is to arm criminas, and disarm the honest, hard-working people.

Even more are 3D PRINTED AR15's in some cartes (see my last paragraph for what happens if USA bans AR15's, and how HILARIOUSLY naive you must be if you think that will empower anyone EXCEPT criminals who'll make home-made AR15's EASILY w/today's technology).

...and Gun-free zones?  Don't even make me laugh; *98% of mass-shootings happened in the Democrat-created gun-free zones.*  This is a ""Shooting fish in a barrel zone, until typical police response-time of 5-12 minutes, or worse the police wait for SWAT which is a typical >25 minute response-time"" which encourages the mass-shooters.  *So a gun-free zone is just a smaller and shorter-term version of despots or cartels having a MONOPOLY on firepower;* good going ""brilliant"" Socialist-Democrat legislators.  Most of these shooters are crazies who commit suicide before the police even arrive, or commit ""suicide by cop"".  WHEN YOU HAVE SECONDS TO LIVE, HELP (POLICE) ARE ONLY MINUTES AWAY. :-)

Anti-gun Broward County Sheriff says ""only police professionals should have guns"" as 4 of his deputies fail to protect students with their guns.  Despite they already had bodyarmor.  MEX poice are even worse (even of those not CORRUPT, the rest are mostly coward, and DON'T mostly have bodyarmor to increase their bravery, nor guns as powwerful as the cartel sicarios').

. . . The millions killed by those Mexican cartels or (usually SOCIALIST) despots facing Disarmeed Sheeple makes ALL school shootings since 1990 look TAME in comparison; even CHICAGO'S ONE YEAR DEATH-COUNT of 2015 or 2016 or 2017 makes ALL school-shootings look TAME in comparison -- but of course the media ignores Chicago, they don't ACTUALLY care about Black people any more than GW Bush did.  ...and so you're left with irrational people who think Western society's biggest problem is mass shootings; the media makes you think cops shot mostly Blac people also, when the REALITY is that, per arrest, the suspects who are white get killed by the cops the MOST often.  MEDIA's coverage is not in-line with the real prevalence of murder-rates; same with the prevalence of whom cops ACTUALLY shoot-during-arrests.  You'd think the media maybe WANTS Blacks to riot, assassinate police, starting a race-war they are ill-prepared to win?

*EVERY mass-shooter was stopped when force was met with force.  So you need hard targets,* not ""shooting fish in a barrel until police arrive"" soft targets, nor ""ban guns and WAIT MINUTES for police"" when shootings can happen in SECONDS 
. . . Also, *_ANYONE CAN 3D PRINT AN AR15 OR GLOCK from plastic and billet aluminum for a <$1,000 machinee that builds >10 FULL-auto rifles per day, you DOPEY Democrats, then the cartel has employees cut the barrels and MANUFACTURE their own ammo -- which any APPRENTICE BLUE FUCKING COLLAR machinist can do.  Idiots. (you are therefore only going to disarm the honest, hard-working portion of society, so ORGANIZED CRIME can prey upon them)_*  Israelis also did home-made guns and beat FIVE Arab armies with these, when in 1938-1947, UK saw that Hitler was the next man they'd need to fight and wanted to woo the already-HITLER-ALLIED Palestinians (didn't work) by alienating their ties to the Jews and Jordanians, a cassified internal memo released near Y2K says that was their motive.

A SEMI OR FULL AUTO RIFLE aint rocket science; banning them = you unilaterally disarm yourselves, whilst people WHO WANT TO KILL YOU cannot be disarmed -- even if you ban 3D printers."

"1417","Kiki Glazebrook I looked up what a troll is, just to make sure. I'm exactly who I say I am, my purpose in this thread is to educate, and I would say the exact same thing if these people were sitting in front of me. 

I'm just sick and tired of seeing people gaslight the truth. I used to be a card carrying NRA member, in the 80s and part of the 90s. I watched the NRA go from being all about gun education, to Charlton Heston saying they'd ""pry his gun from his cold, dead fingers"". That's when I quit. All I wanted was to defend my home, as a single woman, not to be a gunslinger.

I only own black powder guns now, and they're still kept in my safe. They're all inherited heirlooms, or I'd get rid of them as well. I don't want my grandkids getting a hold of a gun that a video game would teach them how to load. I thank the good Lord that my kids never got a hold of my semi-automatic guns when I still had them. 

Another significant event happened in my life, that changed my feelings about guns. My own brother bought a gun because he was scared after firing an employee. A year later, he got very drunk and shot his girlfriend in the head, then put the gun in his mouth, killing him instantly. 

When he first showed me the gun, the way he bragged about it gave me a bad feeling, as though nothing good would come of it. So, no. I don't think everyone should have a gun. He was sane, but, he was a binge drinker. 

To me, what these kids are asking isn't quite enough, but it's a damn good start. I'll do anything I can to support them."

Useful idiots, all of them.  You're being brainwashed.

I served in the Marines from 1999-2007, and witnessed first hand the fake news in Iraq in 2003.  ""1000's of protestors"", was actually a few dozen.  They were celebrating our arrival.

"1618","So does he get the death penalty or what is the sentence"
"1619","He wasn't severely bullied.
In fact,  he was rather alienated than picked on. Here's a synopsis: People didn't befriend Nikolas because they individually believed for him to be insane. What do you expect? The cops get called on you over 30 times, you talk about guns all the time,  you get expelled for bringing knives to school, and so forth."

"1663","Is he being judged by a professional, or a thot in clown makeup?"
"1664","Its not the will of God that the wicked perish but rather that they repent. Besides, does the FBI not share blame since they knew? How about the police that waited outside? Will you be hypocrites and only execute one individual or every one that share responsibility for this incident? How about the one that bullied him? Is she not also guilty? If you execute this kid you might as well execute every sinner, or be called a hypocrite. Judge not or you will be judged. Repent and give him the oppertunity to repent too. If your ""justice"" does not bring back those that are lost then your ""justice"" have already failed. Therefore you should aim to prevent. The only way to prevent all wrong doings is to be the perfect example. Do not be a hypocrite."

They strap the person down in a laying down chair and inject them with drugs until their heart stops. The people are payed money but have no idea what they are doing so it often goes wrong and leads to a painful and horrifying death for the person. Even if you are the worst person alive no one should have to go through that shit like holy fuck, just imagine sitting there waiting to be killed! That’s horrifying!"

"1725","Calm down kid...
First of all, it is stealing because it's not original; you literally just copied the same exact joke from another page.
Second of all, someone calling my mother gay is a joke because it's funny, originally delivered, and it exaggerates, specifically the sexuality of my mother."

"1770","Judge is a stone cold milf"
"1771","Why would someone ever say, “ death penalty is easier” 
I honestly do not understand why people say that, to me if I did ( which I wouldn’t) kill someone I would want life sentence bc I have time to come closer to god and repent of my sins, but if you did death penalty you wouldn’t have time to ask for forgiveness from god or get saved bc all that would cross your mind is what is my last meal gonna be or I’m so scared or I don’t want to die. And when you die there usually no going back unless god sees that you a worthy of another chance and god always will go through that thought process bc he loves you. And once you’re in hell you are confronted with evil and you will stay there for eternity.

And I can already see ppl commenting stuff like gods not real or you’re dumb and bla bla bla but I don’t really care because I have my beliefs and I that’s what I know, god is our father and he loves us end of story ( but hey I’m not the type of Christian to force my religion on people because god wants us to come to him when we actually feel love for him, not fake love because you feel pressured). Also I can also tell ppl are gonna be like why bring in religion, well I’m just saying what I think goes on with why I rather choose life sentence if I ever did something horrible and sinful like that."

The difference a gang member would have made in this young man’s life could have been life saving.  Speak to a local gang member in your neighborhood if you ever have thoughts of taking someone’s life.  They will help you with this issue."
"1916","I’m dead 😂😂😂😂😂"
"1917","Agreed"
"1918","Pagan Slayer a It's harsh enough.
You should also remember this kid was bad news before the shooting."
"1919","Young Money you kill you're own you fucking piece of shit is that why you people drive by houses and light them up while babies and mother's are in there and the poor kid wailing down the street gets shot for just being there you sick fuck... fucking blaming white people an Asian lit up a college never say anything about that? A Spanish guy lit up a school never say anything about that? Blacks killing cops like it's a fucking hobby? Fucking piece of shit"
"1920","""Profiles of shooters indicate that they are often socially isolated and suffer a pattern of ostracization or bullying, yet they tend toward narcissism (Fox & Delateur, 2013; Fox & Levin, 2013; Meloy, 2014). Many fantasize about revenge or murder, and that this type of fantasy is not unusual or “extreme.” Buss’s (2005) research indicates up to 90% of men fantasize about murder. What tips the scales from fantasy to reality? We would argue identification with prior mass shooters made famous by extensive media coverage, including names, faces, writings, and detailed accounts of their lives and backgrounds, is a more powerful push toward violence than mental health status or even access to guns. First proposed by Phillips (1983), the violent media contagion effect was largely ignored by criminologists and psychologists, but more recently the evidence of the power of copycat homicide is mounting.""

I'm not believing in ""random shit"", I'm citing a published academic study that you clearly haven't taken any time to look at. You don't have any academic evidence for your argument, yet you continue to argue as if I'm the one that's ""brainwashed"". If anything, you're the one acting like ""one of those idiots who believe 9/11 was an inside job"". Those people didn't have any genuine evidence for their arguments either. They also resorted to personal attacks when they were backed into a corner just like you ""kiddo""."
"1921","You reminded me of one of those idiots who believe 9/11 was an inside job.."
"1922","Lol, your a brainwashed retarded shit.
Do you really think Nik done this for the notoriety? This kid lived the crappiest life on Earth; biological mother abandoned him, adoptive parents died, and you have very little or no friends, on top of that being bullied/avoided???  Don't forget this guy has mental disorders, Autism, ADHD, and OCD, this guy is already jacked up enough. There was so much anger inside of him, and he decided to unleash it on his former high school.

And think about it, if they weren't shown on the news would it make a difference to their mentality? Most likely NOT.

Stop believing random shit kiddo."
"1923","""Seeking fame keeps narcissism intact; attaining fame, or the certainty that one will, is an effective anti-venom to the constant risk of the
individual’s low self-esteem or feelings of hopelessness seeping through the thin skin of narcissistic thinking and behavior. And, unfortunately, we find that a cross-cutting trait among many profiles of mass shooters is desire for fame.""

Must be nice, being able to generalize half of your country based on their political views as ""heartless bastards""

The kid did something horrible. That's one thing. But making his trial basically a public ordeal where people are allowed to spew hate at him is not alright. Especially not those people who preach about him being bad, but admitted to bullying him. Yes, several of the teenage anti-gun speakers personally bullied this kid. 

I don't care about rep. or dem. I am not even from the US. But the fact is clear that the US has a mental health issue, and this kid is the prime example of a person cast out from society and hurt its members getting fed up. We have to take equal measures on both sides. 

I don't care if he gets life or death. But lock the sherrif up who failed at his job. Fire the FBI employees who failed at their job. And most importantly, investigate and prosecute the kids who bullied his kid. 

You know what, let me put it this way: I don't know this kid, how sabe he was. But let's say he is a dog. The kids kick the dog. Once. Twice. Dozens of times. Then the dog bites back. What do you think, who is responsible? The dog will be killed - but wouldn't you give a giant slap to the face for those kids for torturing a dog? And this isn't a dog. This is a human bring we are talking about!"

"1943","Are we gonna forget that it is common sense for ANYONE to not take a gun and kill innocent lives, you are sickening I don’t care if he’s been bullied, abused or hurt mentally but you NEVER do that to someone no matter what, you find others ways to help yourself and resolve the issue killing is not the answer at all"
"1944","Ron Swanson this is rt🤔ive heard that one of the school students said that the school shooter was a guy with full black mask and vest🤔and cops found him 2 miles away from the school within the 60 seconds they got there..which made no sense on how he got that far..🤔im not saying he didn't do it I'm wondering"

Just imagine killing another human; regardless of what they've done to you. It'll hit you like a fucking train. It's similar to fist fights - altercation, then you begin punching. As soon as you realize how badly you hurt your opponent, you'll feel shame and regret.
And killing is 10x worse, so just take a second to ponder what that'll feel like.."

Never seen leaving the school with it. Call me a dumbass again. Dumbass."
"1979","Leah Yes because they're actors.  Why did a teacher say it was a man dressed in full body armor carrying a gun she has never seen before.  Why did a female student on film say she was walking with cruz down the hallway when the shooting happened and that she said cruz never had a gun on him.  No one died, it is all a hoax.  They even used dummies for the dead bodies and vids show it.  The body has no face and no arms."
