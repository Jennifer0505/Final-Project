Hey hey hey, easy now. We can talk, or you can attempt to insult me.
The key word there is ""almost"". The key point I brought up, is the *rise* of knife crimes. If you think taking legal guns away will stop people from getting guns, you probably aren't aware of how many already get them *illegally* . I'm not even really pro gun, I don't need a gun. I just don't think taking them will help and it is in fact denying people of their rights, to force them to give them up.
A crazy person can wield a knife just as easily as they could wield a gun and a knife can be obtained, if the gun cannot.
I happen to believe losing one person to murder, is just as bad as losing ten people.
Did you know civilian gun owners save the lives of 500,000 up to 3 million people each year in the U.S.? 
So, right there you have up to 3 million people who could be involved in deadly gun violence, if they decide to take everyone's gun's. Remember criminals don't need to get them legally.","4/19/18"

I'm BY NO MEANS saying that if someone's making threats (that's when you should report them) not to report them but that just because someone has an interest in guns or knifes and wants to share they're interest's with other people DOES NOT mean they're going to shoot up the local school, it just means they're expressing theyre interests. I'm neutral in this debate as I'm from Ireland and guns aren't a huge thing here(unfortunately) and neither of my parents own guns and I've never held a real one other than when i went on a visit to the army barracks with scouts a couple of years ago but i intended to get 1 when I'm 16.

But it is changing. More and more people are waking up every day, even as the New World order tries harder to gull them into stupid acceptance of their crimes. I recommend everyone view ""Sandy Hook Crisis Actors Robbie Parker"" and ""Sandy Hook Crisis Actors David Wheeler"" for a start. Also anything by Jim Fetzer and Ole Damegaard on the subject. ""Jim Fetzer Florida Shooting"" is good. Then research all the fake shootings as you have the time. They all stink to high heaven of a conspiracy to disarm America by subterfuge.

Cruz had assaulted people while he was in school, and the authorities did not arrest him because the county was trying to reduce the disproportionate number of arrests of minority students, because their thinking was that not only does a criminal record hurt a student's future and makes them more likely to be an adult criminal which is why it would be better to have alternative ""treatments"" for their criminal behavior, but these minority students are arrested more because of discrimination (which is obviously not true as you can look up the crime statistics by race and see that minority students, or really black and Hispanic, do commit proportionately more crimes).  This is all of course completely swept under the rug by the media.  You can look it all up.  It's not a conspiracy theory.

You're deluded about the Bahamas.  Their crime rate might be lower than the U.S.'s but that does not mean they are some low-maintenance country in terms of crime where the police can effectively do their job without a gun.

Most gun crimes are committed by people who do not legally own the gun used in the crime.  They either steal them, buy them off the black market or through a straw purchase.  

http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/

Criminals do not follow the law when it come to gun control.  If they are already thinking about committing a crime, they are not going to let a background check and a waiting period stop them, especially if they are considering a murder-suicide shooting spree.  Convicted criminals STILL find ways to access guns.  

Australia's gun crime rate was already low prior to gun control.  A lot of factors when it comes to crime and violence have to do with things OTHER than gun laws.  You can't point out single examples of gun control in low gun crime countries and cite that as proof gun control works, because there are countries with low crime and laxer gun control laws or higher gun ownership.  You can even find these contradictory examples in the U.S. among states and cities, e.g. California and Texas.

Also gun violence and crime in general in the U.S. has been going down.  It still is.  The fact is that most gun violence can be attributed to either suicide or gang- or drug-related crimes.  Even more so most gun violence happens in particular areas, not all over the place, and mass shootings aren't even a significant portion of gun violence.  Yes, something SHOULD be done about it, but considering that the local authorities and the feds wouldn't even enforce the existing laws for arresting a person committing a crime, perhaps we should start by having them do that and repealing this stupid, bullshit affirmative action policy for arrests by race.  Remember, if that policy didn't exist and the authorities had actually acted competently, Cruz would have had a criminal record show up in his background check at the gun stores, and he would not have legally been allowed to buy a gun.","4/1/18"

Seriously, you can look it up.  It's an affirmative action policy designed to decrease the disproportionate amount of minority students arrested for crimes.  IF CRUZ HAD BEEN ARRESTED LIKE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HIS CRIMES PRIOR, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRIMINAL RECORD OF HIM APPEAR IN HIS BACKGROUND CHECK AND THUS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEGALLY PURCHASE THE GUNS.  How these imbeciles can complain that more laws need to be passed when they ignore the fact that the existing laws weren't applied is beyond reason.

The mental health record thing is a silly idea.  People will simply just not seek treatment for their mental illnesses if they know it will make it harder to buy a gun.

If those drugs were more accessible, those problems would for the most part go away.  So if banning drugs only makes the problems worse, how will banning guns from certain people improve anything?

That is more than one mass shooting per day, which means even 20 in 2 months is STILL a lower rate under Trump than under Obama.

I'm just making the point that you are ignorantly and falsely claiming we have more mass shootings while Trump is president than Obama.)

It's also been a bipartisan effort to increase the amount of psychotropic drugging of children in this country for several decades now.  Many of these school mass shooters are on SSRI's, which have a known side effect of violence and suicide.  Of course neither party is talking about that.

Then there's the affirmative action, political correctness policy that stopped authorities from arresting Cruz, which would have made him ineligible to buy those guns legally since it would give him a criminal record.

His point was that *instead of PRESSING CHARGES when Trayvon was caught with Burglary Tools and old lady's jewelry in his school locker,* to get Trayvon and all the similar little hooligans mental help, or a Parole Officer who's breathing down their neck (compared to the other kids) or other court mandated ""early intervention"" (to quote what he wrote), *instead, the Dem Party mayors, sheriffs, etc made a policy to NOT EVEN TRY to get convictions on kids like Trayvon or the FL school-shooter.  Do I need to CONNECT The DOTS FOR YOU: 1. They coulda TAKEN AWAY the FL school-shooter's gun rights, IF they had pursued felony convictions against that kid for his misbehavior YEARS before he sht-up the school -- instead of ONLY kicking him outta school -- you idiot.  He WAS the prime suspect in SEVERAL FELONIES for YEARS before he shot-up the school, but Democrats ran the school's police and the POLICY (not only his specific case) of these RACIST SJW's who run Broward's police is to REFUSE to even TRY to convict minority-race students.*  2. Trayvon maybe wouldn't be PEEKING INTO WINDOWS when Zimmerman was 'patroling' his neighborhood (and this no fight nor gun-play wouda happened if Zimmerman hadn't seeen Trayvon peeking into windows that night...) *if Trayvon had a P.O. breathing down his neck for his PRIOR Possession Of Burglary Tools or even more serious Grand Larceny conviction.  But he too lived in a jurisdictin where police/mayors/etc are Democrats with this RACIST and FANGEROUS policy.*  So they REFUSED to even TRY (ie. refuse to press charges on non-white ids, AS A POLICY.

So yes, we all fucking AGREE ALREADY WITH YOU THAT TRAYVON WAS NOT CONVICTED, ya clueless ass-hat.","4/3/18"

I only own black powder guns now, and they're still kept in my safe. They're all inherited heirlooms, or I'd get rid of them as well. I don't want my grandkids getting a hold of a gun that a video game would teach them how to load. I thank the good Lord that my kids never got a hold of my semi-automatic guns when I still had them. 

Another significant event happened in my life, that changed my feelings about guns. My own brother bought a gun because he was scared after firing an employee. A year later, he got very drunk and shot his girlfriend in the head, then put the gun in his mouth, killing him instantly. 

When he first showed me the gun, the way he bragged about it gave me a bad feeling, as though nothing good would come of it. So, no. I don't think everyone should have a gun. He was sane, but, he was a binge drinker. 

To me, what these kids are asking isn't quite enough, but it's a damn good start. I'll do anything I can to support them.","4/17/18"

I honestly do not understand why people say that, to me if I did ( which I wouldnÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöt) kill someone I would want life sentence bc I have time to come closer to god and repent of my sins, but if you did death penalty you wouldnÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöt have time to ask for forgiveness from god or get saved bc all that would cross your mind is what is my last meal gonna be or IÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöm so scared or I donÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöt want to die. And when you die there usually no going back unless god sees that you a worthy of another chance and god always will go through that thought process bc he loves you. And once youÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöre in hell you are confronted with evil and you will stay there for eternity.

And I can already see ppl commenting stuff like gods not real or youÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöre dumb and bla bla bla but I donÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöt really care because I have my beliefs and I thatÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåös what I know, god is our father and he loves us end of story ( but hey IÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöm not the type of Christian to force my religion on people because god wants us to come to him when we actually feel love for him, not fake love because you feel pressured). Also I can also tell ppl are gonna be like why bring in religion, well IÌâå_ÌâåÑÌÄåöm just saying what I think goes on with why I rather choose life sentence if I ever did something horrible and sinful like that.","4/1/18"

The kid did something horrible. That's one thing. But making his trial basically a public ordeal where people are allowed to spew hate at him is not alright. Especially not those people who preach about him being bad, but admitted to bullying him. Yes, several of the teenage anti-gun speakers personally bullied this kid. 

I don't care about rep. or dem. I am not even from the US. But the fact is clear that the US has a mental health issue, and this kid is the prime example of a person cast out from society and hurt its members getting fed up. We have to take equal measures on both sides. 

I don't care if he gets life or death. But lock the sherrif up who failed at his job. Fire the FBI employees who failed at their job. And most importantly, investigate and prosecute the kids who bullied his kid. 

You know what, let me put it this way: I don't know this kid, how sabe he was. But let's say he is a dog. The kids kick the dog. Once. Twice. Dozens of times. Then the dog bites back. What do you think, who is responsible? The dog will be killed - but wouldn't you give a giant slap to the face for those kids for torturing a dog? And this isn't a dog.
